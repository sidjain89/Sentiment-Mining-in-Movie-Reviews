i have a soft spot in my heart for pure amoral sleaze i liked showgirls there i said it i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz sex filled cinematic tabloid ish trash wild things is the best sleazy film i ve ever seen it s filled with great performances graphic sex three way sex rape charges double crosses plot twists genitalia of all genders graphic violence death witty humor and best of all denise richards criticizing this film for being disgusting raucous and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing or titanic for being lofty and epic wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors but i don t just admire it for this i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies i must admit up front however that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal i imagine that this shows it s hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn t be known i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer but i was wrong there are a lot of turns here i ll just say that the film takes place in blue bay a rich little town in florida in blue bay lives sam lombardo matt dillon a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students kelly van ryan denise richards and suzie toller neve campbell kelly s mother sandra theresa russell immediately presses charges all of this happens fairly early in the film and right up until this point i had the whole film predicted i was wrong though and every time i was proven wrong i was shocked wild things isn t even remotely plausible but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless and often invited just for kicks i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers i d give the preview four stars it made me want to see the movie so much that i ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since over the past few weeks though i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview see independence day thankfully i was proven wrong the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company not only does it make us want to see the film but it doesn t give away any of the secrets but i m not here to talk about the preview i m here to talk about denise richards now i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she s in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can of course this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes and flawless body but i thought she did a great job acting too stop laughing no richards is truly a find she is talented and always convincing in this film this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future the other actors are good too dillon is as suave as ever it s nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in out bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them though i won t pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex for a plot like this to work all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived that s okay because director john mcnaughton knows that he s making a self consciously wicked film each scene even the three way sex scene is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton and the result is a sleaze fest that s too smart to resist there isn t an inconsistent moment in wild things every bit of it is alluring garbage so trashy it s funny and so entertaining it s painful i loved it 
the makers of jurassic park the director of speed conjure up a storm reviewed at eng wah s new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio unlike earthquakes their fury is precise unlike hurricanes their reach is unlimited unlike fires there is no way to combat them unlike floods their terror is sudden excerpt from twister production notes i m sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes or twisters before i for one have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally i feel tornado caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes that is until i saw twister the destruction caused by twisters may be precise not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable it will suck in cars houses livestock etc basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister you ll get to see all this close up twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers these people are basically out of their mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister occurrences they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes trying to get as close as they can that is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them jo helen hunt is the leader of this pack of kamikazes while they are gearing up for the mother of all storms as predicted by satellite recon bill bill paxton a former co leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo apparently bill has left his rogue ish days for greener and more practical pastures as a television weatherman he catches up with his old self and follows the pack like the good ole days bringing his wife to be melissa jamie gertz along a city bred woman toting around with a handphone jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement s of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early warning system can be implemented the problem is the device has to be placed very near the twister and in its path which is practically unpredictable of destruction in order for it to function to add to their current challenge there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation funded led by jonas cary elwes and they too have a similar device thus begins the race jo s cheap government equipment with beaten up vehicles against jonas s high tech computers and satellite link ups with their sleek black all terrain vans plot wise there are not really anything to shout about twister is as predictable as any summer box office hit can get there is the danger of the twister the competition with jonas os more well off team and of course the settling of differences between jo and bill this part gives the film its human substance helen hunt bill paxton and the rest of the actors actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie the twister itself thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm lucasfilm s industrial light and magic we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films for action sequences like his previous film speed the tornado sequences which are essentially the action sequences are well visualised and edited audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this twister is definitely an effect dependent movie now that id fever has begun to reside and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et s ass for the umpteenth time twister is your sure bet of bucks well spent watch it in a good theatre please the flying inkpot s rating system wait for the video a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
 we run tings tings don t run we sound advice from capone paul campbell to his squaddie or partner floyd winston bell jamaican film shot entirely on video featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo styled brotherhood morals and a little gunplay capone a tough as nails super cop gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home while he was with his lady and killed his partner in front of him when he arrives he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and much to his disappointment also finds out his childhood friend ratty mark danvers has been helping him torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films although the action isn t as hyperkinetic as most of woo s films are the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though and eventually begin to take on a life of their own beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after the make up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well with flawless squib work on display from the effects team the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue spoken with thick jamaican accents half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang just adds to the interest paul campbell as the loose cannon capone essays his role perfectly displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty the part time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together unfortunately carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective largely because his underlings seem to run all over him but then again that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists sly and robbie who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones maxi priest bob dylan james brown grace jones herbie hancock bootsy collins and carly simon among others the end credit song we run tings by the group red dragon is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review oddly enough desmond ballentine who plays the character deportee is well known as a pioneer in the realm of gangsta reggae as the performer ninjaman and he doesn t contribute a single song to the film that i could see which is virtually unheard of here in the us at the time of this writing third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us coming off of a six month box office breaking run in jamaica where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time bringing in million in jamaica which is roughly us palm pictures the company that released the offbeat but entertaining six string samurai is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters chris blackwell founder of palm pictures was also involved in the production of another jamaican box office smash in entitled countryman so i d say he has a pretty good track record overall third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo ringo lam tsui hark and many other action films by directors from hong kong if action films are your thing and you don t mind intermittent subtitles then you can t go wrong with this film the performances and the story are solid if only a little cliched and the action is tight i m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like but apparently third world cop s honors are well deserved 
one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length if a film is only minutes but feels like minutes then it s crap but if a film last hours and feels like minutes then it s excellent boogie nights falls into the latter catagory the director anderson delivers a funny hip yet sometimes violent film which flies along mark whalberg a k a marky mark plays eddie adams a seventeen year old with a certain gift in the midriff area jack horner reynolds is a adult film director who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business after running away from home eddie joins jack changes his name to dirk diggler and starts making erotic movies in the movie business dirk meets a whole load of characters which the film introduces very quickly and slickly such as scotty phillip seymour hoffman rollergirl graham amber moore and floyd phillip baker hall and little bill william h macy all the characters are well written well played and the audience gets to know them pretty well thanks to the excellent script we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce rollergirls hard time at school and little bills wife who sleeps with everyone except her husband but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing the direction is fast thrilling and never holds up there are some great shots some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences and lots of other neat directional touches the writing is fabulous with some intelligent dialogue some funny dialogue but none of the dialogue is crap like most hollywood films such as the lost world jurassic park or tommorow never dies boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing on par and sometimes betters quentin tarantino s films resevoir dogs and pulp fiction the soundtrack is also excellent like american graffiti the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack which heightens the atmosphere and gives the film an extra lift also the costumes are great the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties the film although excellent does have some flaws firstly wahlberg although excellent cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry in both scenes where he has to act angry his acting is so off the scenes tension and anger is lost but the rest of the cast are excellent burt reynolds is brilliant julianne moore shows real emotion and william h macy is great aswell but he always is another flaw with the film though is that the ending seems a bit tacked on it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit and needed to wrap up quickly it s a shame really as the rest of the film is perfectly paced but they re small niggles really boogie nights is an excellent film superb directing writing acting and music all combine to make one spectacular film whatever you do do not miss out on boogie nights 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned the teaser trailers for my best friend s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope it looked like the sort of goofy light hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight but little more i d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend s wedding was such a success a strong bouyant romantic comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects featuring a triumphant performance from ms roberts the heroine of my best friend s wedding is julianne potter julia roberts a successful new york restaurant critic and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes rupert everett that years ago she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex lover michael o neal dermot mulroney a sports writer that if they both hadn t married by the time they reached they had promised to marry each other both julianne and michael are both single of course and when george inquires about michael s age julianne realizes that he s mere weeks away from his th birthday and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day however she finds herself even more distraught when michael s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace cameron diaz and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary the setup for my best friend s wedding then is a fairly conventional one and in many ways the film s storyline is formulaic but only to a certain extent the film was directed by p j hogan whose first feature muriel s wedding had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly duckling story and the same holds true for my best friend s wedding which confidently combines traditional romantic comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr hogan for example there s a heartfelt emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film with a trio of teenagers inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks harmonizing in the background my best friend s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen s everyone says i love you i d even assert it s a more successful one my best friend s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well in a typical romantic comedy kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty conniving ice queen and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps this film is smarter than that here kimmy is sweet sincere and innocent julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy s life she d actually like her too the george character is almost a staple of recent film the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason but in my best friend s wedding he gets to have a playful mischievous and charming personality throughout the film the formulaisms one often sees is romantic comedy are given little twists and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion there is a lot of smart writing in the well paced screenplay by ronald bass we re given four interesting vivid and likeable characters with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments my best friend s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts who turns in a top notch confident and reassured performance as julianne this isn t the sort of role one usually associates with ms roberts the julianne character s neurotic fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role but ms roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience if not entirely sympathetic even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable even better than ms roberts though is cameron diaz who turns in a shining performance in my best friend s weddding with a smile which lights up the screen she effectively conveys kimmy s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner and never hits a false note in the film she even sings i won t soon forget her charming serenade of i just don t know what to do with myself rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film his george is a bit of a devilish rogue entirely affable and mr everett s performance is a delight to watch he s clearly having fun and his joy is infectuous dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role unlike the other characters in the film he s not given a lot to do but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms roberts and mr mulroney and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic when julia roberts lustre began to fade and she was usurped from her title as america s sweetheart by sandra bullock i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile while that didn t quite work out it s near certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in the romantic comedy will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game my best friend s wedding marks a return to form for ms roberts and cements p j hogan s reputation as a skilled director of comedy 
earlier this year the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics a real charmer of a movie it s possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience now at the end of comes waking ned devine a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter there s no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere they strike all the same chords but still ned devine is a movie worth seeing the plot is interesting and robust the latest lottery winner is ned devine jimmy keogh of tullymore ireland ned s prize is over six million pounds but the shock of winning killed the poor old man and the check remains unclaimed enter jackie o shea ian bannen and michael o sullivan david kelly the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village the two men eventually find the ticket and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he s actually ned the entire town can reap the benefits their only adversary is an ancient old woman eileen dromey who sees more profit in reporting the fraud ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael jackie stocky and large is the brains behind the operation michael scrawny and short is the method man the two contrast each other delightfully and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience every viewer is sure to like both of them there are other minor subplots included as well such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer this appears quite inconsequential until the end and even with a startling revelation it s a tad bit unnecessary overall waking ned devine has a predictable outcome and plot twists are never really taken seriously the ending a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout the kirk jones script is indeed off the cuff in a way waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents warm friendly outgoing and jovial it s the perfect kind of comedy a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes there s nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one indeed it s one of the year s best feel good movies minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss 
for this review and more visit clear illusions www clearillusions com the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music worn out dialogue such as i ll be right back or simply with the overall tone of the scene how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change that s the kind of bursting originality that allows final destination to invade the viewer s mind even days after seeing it making one pause before ever entering a dark room taking a shower or even going to sleep the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since s scream final destination directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick glen morgan and james wong the latter two being writers for the t v series the x files is a movie with wonderful ideas and executes them effortlessly it s rare a film of this nature can grab an audience s attention these days as the genre has seem to be completely worn out but final destination has more in store for one than one can imagine unlike halloween s michael myers or nightmare on elm street s freddy kruger final destination s killer is of the supernatural the dark one himself death the intriguing premise is as follows a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip after boarding the plane one of the students alex browning devon sawa dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff killing everyone on board once waking up alex gets himself and six others off of that plane all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening shortly after their departure the plane takes off and guess what it blows up in middair now alex and fellow survivors who consist of friend clear waters ali larter enemy carter kerr smith carter s girlfriend terry amanda detmer the goofy billy sean william scott and his brother tod chad donella and teacher ms valerie lewton kristen cloke are in extreme danger as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane and now death wants them the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane but who is next and how will death get them final destination is a film that is unbearably suspenseful always making the viewer frantic as death will strike in the most unlikely of times john denver s rocky mountain high being played pretty much warrants another death everyone on that plane learned the hard way although it s usually given whose life will be taken next the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades because you don t know when death is coming like the characters in the movie i was constantly nervous and shaky during final destination the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air and yes the film is that intense the cast is surprisingly effective and up to par the best ensemble in this genre since scream the characters have multi dimensional personalities for a change and for the most part you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances that like the scream movies did for their cast will launch them into superstardom kerr smith and kristen cloke are also impressive although the two don t posses as much screen time as the leads final destination is one exhilarating exciting ride any age should be able to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack for the blood loving moviegoer destination contains buckets of blood guts and all that good stuff final destination is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans and a sleeper hit at the box office hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me by scare i don t mean making me jump or making me wonder if i m in danger but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind absorbing you leaving one question that s constantly on your mind is death coming for me the bottom line make final destination your destination 
it s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year but that is what disney and pixar animation s latest film represents while a bugs life isn t nearly as deep as it s predecessor dreamwork s antz it is just as funny a bug s life centers appropriately around the life of an ant named flik flik cutely voiced by newsradio s david foley hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission they never dream he will be successful they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food flik s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs who he mistakenly assumes are warriors when he returns with the warriors the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes a bug s life has animation that is simply stunning the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative together with the great voice acting this film is the perfect holiday family film its main weakness is that it couldn t beat antz to the theaters making it seem like stale material 
 i d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation from elmer gantry on we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church well think again for the apostle which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister and by implication all the rest of organized religion instead it gives us a highly devout man who certainly has his foibles but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god and arguably just as surprising the good spirited film is no comedy even if it does have humorous moments instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures when in the privacy of his attic robert duvall as texas preacher euliss sonny dewey argues sternly with his lord the scene shares a kinship with emily watson s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves s most powerful scene the body of the story starts with sonny s coming upon an horrific auto accident which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters with his well worn bible in hand sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident s dying victims the scowling police officer orders him to go away and after he has tried to work his miracles sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord s work robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film s director writer executive producer and chief financier rarely has a movie been such a labor of love with a white suit peach colored shirt and tie and dark sunglasses sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher duvall has every movement down pat even when he is walking down the street the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy he dances and claps all the way sonny s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep voiced black orators but his rhetoric is always competitive i may be on the devil s hit list but i m on god s mailing list he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent and they lap it up people jump up scream praise the lord and mean it the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable but sonny is no saint it turns out that he has a wandering eye which angers his wife jessie played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny s church leaving him unemployed sonny letting his temper get the best of him does something foolish which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever the bulk of the film occurs in a small predominately black church in louisiana which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church one way road to heaven holiness temple with an enthusiastic flock in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e f the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church he asks his members to tithe but he gives all of his money and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks a man who can t stand to be still he tells one of his friends i quit school because i didn t like recess in his new town he meets toosie miranda richardson who like him has a family that she hasn t seen in a while his romance with the separated woman like the rest of the film doesn t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show s many surprising scenes again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take although it probably couldn t have ended any other way the movie does wrap things up nicely and don t miss the sweet epilogue during the film s closing credits a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film the apostle runs a little too long at it is rated pg for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up 
if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton chop sideburns to each side of his head spoken with a thick irish accent and tried his damnedest to play it straight he wouldn t have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in i went down gleeson who s not dissimilar to the late saturday night live alumnus in terms of physical attributes plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film bunny is sent to county cork to retrieve one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle bunny is to accompany git hynes peter mcdonald recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies that tom french is a mean bollocks he wants frank back and a small matter of some that tom s wife was supposed to have given to frank for this he won t break anyone s thumbs maybe inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach i went down follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs dimly lit pubs and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity the butcher boy even if you can t comprehend half of what they re saying gleeson and mcdonald together make i went down a trip worth taking the film is in many ways reminiscent of another little independent feature s highway that film too was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson s tale whimsical observations on life carefully crafted vignettes deadpan conversational asides and scenes that ll make you laugh out loud witness the episode in which our good natured protagonists bind frank played by peter caffrey to a hotel bed leaving him with only the tv remote for company that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in highway what s also charming about i went down is how the relationship between buddy and git develops their trip becomes an education for both of them but the way it s handled is neither sappy nor labored the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation via flashbacks of the relationship between frank and tom it s a little too hollywood and what makes i went down so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies sure it s gritty make that grubby but it s also pretty goofy although i went down emphasizes the comedic elements of dis organized crime there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter don t let these deter you though i went down is a little gem it s only playing at one philadelphia area theater and i suspect it won t be there for long so catch it while you can 
jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled kevin smith s greatest hits for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smith s earlier works including clerks mall rats chasing amy and dogma so be advised bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith s latest outing kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature most notably miramax the studio whose subsidiary dimension films is jay and silent bob s distributor others deserving accolades include ben affleck matt damon directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas this is a laugh filled foul mouthed road film with jay jason mewes and silent bob smith hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax s production of bluntman and chronic comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers jay s convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing but rather their comic book counterparts no matter the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker played by george carlin who tells them to follow the book the rules of the road of course jay s interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun carrie fisher who offers them a ride jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie s weaker aspects which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell can be easily tolerated really how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van and jay has a pot induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne the movie s highlight though is near the finale in hollywood jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck damon picture good will hunting hunting season here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other s careers and film choices and the laughs continue to grow next up is jason american pie biggs and james dawson s creek van der beek the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles finally comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature this bit will leave you howling smith s obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers he allows them to play it all tongue in cheek their fun comes through the screen to the audience it is too bad that this is jay and silent bob s swan song the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks but smith realizes that times have changed and he doesn t want his creations to overstay their welcome so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit saving the best for last goodbye jay and silent bob at least you re going out with a blast

when i left the theater after seeing david lynch s lost highway i remarked to a fellow movie goer i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears in his first feature film in five years lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture eraserhead on the weirdness scale you won t know what happened when it s over though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses it is difficult to describe the plot of this film because it depends partly on how you interpret it i can however describe what we see on the screen l a jazz saxophonist fred madison bill pullman and his wife renee patricia arquette whom he clearly suspects of infidelity receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep they are naturally enough more than a little frightened and confused and it doesn t help matters any when mystery man robert blake approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving the next morning fred finds another videotape which to his and our surprise shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton balthazar getty the perplexed prison officials release dayton whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways most notably his affair with alice wakefield arquette again a blonde who is otherwise renee s spitting image and another encounter with the mystery man i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more but suffice it to say that lynch doesn t offer any neat wrap ups nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion the cinematic demons of lost highway are out in full force from beginning to end this description might make lost highway sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism but in fact while there are traces of lynch s weird sense of humor this film is anything but giddy most of the time on the contrary lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery rather the character is the mystery there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion distrust and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings on here we the audience are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this probably fred s in my opinion and what in that case the other characters and events are meant to represent all of this proceeds appropriately in lynch s typically slow paced idiosyncratic style as is often the case lynch relies on sound imagery and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story and in lost highway it works perfectly there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil s song to the siren can be heard faintly in the background nothing is technically happening in these scenes yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as if not more so than the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity lynch s direction and director of photography pete deming s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story well most of the time anyway i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer s attention because of its tie ins to the original mystery the main characters in this reality dayton a well meaning but none too intelligent year old a sleazy gangster who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character and his porn star girlfriend the blond arquette are nothing you couldn t find in any of the two dozen pulp fiction wannabes fortunately the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements such as the strained awkward conversations between pete and his parents help to preserve the film s spooky unnerving tone during this stretch lynch s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery are also somewhat overdone here it s not exactly exploitative like almost everything else in this film the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off that said these minor flaws don t prevent lost highway from attaining its place as one of the darkest most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years it is a one way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind and as such it is gripping intense and brilliantly effective 
voices trey parker matt stone george clooney minnie driver south park bigger longer and uncut is undoubtedly crude offensive mean spirited movie that comes off as a politcally correct movie too if your canadian a strong christian fat gay or anything else you will be offended but when you watch this movie there is no doubt that you will laugh based on the wildly popular comedy central tv show south park stars cartman an overweight foul mouthed kid with attitude and a sweet side kenny a poor kid who gets killed in every episode and talks with his coat hood covering his head stan a regular sometimes boring kid who has problems with women and kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop the movie opens with a funny but messageable song that all of the people of south park sing cartman stan kenny and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance and phillip beavis and butthead types movie asses of fire but when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets they learn the movie is rated r which of course means that anyone under the age of cannot get in without a parent or legal guardian the kids do not understand this and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets while in the movie laughing at the movie terrance and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining the kids they kids then go out and cuss themselves getting in trouble and causing kyle s mom to go against the mpaa while doing this kenny learns a thing or to by proving to cartman he can light his fart on fire kenny does so dies and goes to hell to find out that satan and saddam huiessan homosexual lovers are about to take over the world if terrance and phillip die from here on nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise but believe me this isn t your regular south park tv show and should not be seen by anyone under or more this film contains extreme profanity over f words and a collection of others but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way south park bigger longer and uncut has many messages that are embedded inside it but i bet you will not leave the movie for at least laughing one time or more and enjoying yourself take it from me south park b l and u isn t as good as you d hope but it is good for some laughs 
synopsis an attractive mute makeup artist working on an ultra cheesy slasher movie in moscow witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians meanwhile the artist s sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her comments mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it drawn by the clever artwork on the video box i rented the film expecting a complete turkey mute witness however was original offbeat and well made it s one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about i ve subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit and it may be seen on occasion on the independent film channel the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense as billy the quite believable mute heroine sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy s vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures to throw a curveball into the fray billy s sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film look for alec guinness obi wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy in a small role as the evil reaper definately check this movie out although as a word of warning it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren t for the squeamish 
cinema has been around for about a hundred years now it s not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film but i d like to think that i m beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time recently i ve seen the films of hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius they are likely to be remembered for well quite a while i like this film too yes it s a disaster slash action movie true its budget is a lot more money than i ll ever see in my lifetime and there s not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money in fact i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film had they thought it would ve been more profitable i certainly don t care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such a skilled director that i doubt he d ever make a film that is difficult to sit through of course skillful direction doesn t complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together the story is well thought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters yes you read that right armageddon actually has characters you can care about if you don t like this film then you have a problem with the genre itself armageddon is as good as a film like this can be if you ve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film so it s up to the u s government to stop it why the u s is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated their plan to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate a nuclear warhead within the head driller is harry stamper bruce willis his group of men is a colorful bunch including a j ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi there s also an interesting triangle formed between a j harry and grace liv tyler who is harry s daughter a j and grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad isn t too happy with the situation it s absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you d like to call armageddon it s not about story it s about viscera and action and thrills a minute and all that stuff it s incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens but bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better i think most of the budget went to cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles take the spectacular opening scene for instance in which a meteor shower obliterates new york a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars the action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways i like his quick edit style because it s abrasive and exhausting to watch it s also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times but it s fun to be obnoxious sometimes the special effects in this film put every other blockbuster to shame deep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable special effects are very important in a film like this if they re not good then the image is not convincing and the film doesn t work everything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid the effects that don t look totally real are still a pleasure to behold and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice looking that it actually qualifies as art of course all of this would add up to little more than an above average light show if i didn t get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action the film is two and a half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots i won t suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions aren t put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way in fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and that s a lot more than i can say about deep impact which was banking on the feel good parts of its story bruce willis is terrific and i m glad to see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing tyler and affleck are great together and make a convincing couple all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level patton who is a magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his ex wife and son is very moving the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays a crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keeps the film lively and funny i wasn t challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon and i don t mind too much but the film doesn t insult my intelligence it s pitched perfectly to entertain which is what all it really wants to do it s not mindless and escapist but well crafted cinema it might have been created for the wrong reasons but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good in spite of the producers and the budget i m not saying that films like this are risky moves what i am saying is that armageddon is a big loud expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms 
when you go to the movies as much as i do you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times such was the case with frequency every time i went to a screening there was the frequency preview it looked awful it looked cheesy sappy and ridiculous it looked like a flop well whoever put that trailer together should be fired because in terms of pure entertainment frequency is one of the best of the year thus far frequency boasts a compelling story line an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan james caviezel to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan dennis quaid through a ham radio despite the fact that frank has been dead for years john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire but by doing so causes other changes somehow a serial killer s reign of terror which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders extends to ten victims including john s mother this is director gregory hoblit s third film the other two being primal fear and fallen with all three he s managed to attach himself to great scripts this one by toby emmerich whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films and add equally great direction also he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick ass ending frequency is no exception the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying hoblit is three for three and i hope he can keep it up now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci fi elements of frequency but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved who s to say how something works and how it doesn t when it s never happened is it because we ve become accustomed to time travel laws from other places like star trek and the back to the future trilogy and quantum leap yes if you sit down and think about it certain plot elements in this film probably won t make any sense most films are like that don t let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however when frequency was over it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug okay okay shut up when you break it down past all its sci fi elements and serial killer antics frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share it s touching it s sincere and it s what ultimately makes this movie work pg 
synopsis private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband after uncovering the authenticity of the film welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers comments mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time though it doesn t present a snuff film a movie which documents a person s murder for real usually during or after some form of sexual act as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as say natural born killers mm stays in your head long after you see it it is not fun to watch see something else if you get upset by realistic sadistic violence this film s violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc territory for those with strong stomachs however mm is an intelligent worthwhile thriller especially during its second hour nicolas cage after a couple ho hum movies returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities as tom welles a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly born daughter cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix who plays a struggling songwriter named max california california despite his name is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character the real star of the movie though must be peter stormare stormare played the really really evil guy in fargo and his character dino velvet in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable his performance is very chilling mm s success may hardly be surprising it was directed by joel schumacher who hopefully saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin before directing the last two batman duds however schumacher was responsible for several well made horror flicks lost boys flatliners and falling down mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self destructs before the audience s eyes mm was written by andrew kevin walker who also penned the academy award winning thriller seven a few years back like seven mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater welles is searching for answers how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly methodically sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end the murderer responds that there are no reasons he just enjoys it that walker seems to suggest is where the real terror lays not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist a couple minor faults led me to my four star rating five stars is the highest rating i give one i found it a little difficult early on to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film yes snuff is a horrible thing but a detective of welles caliber has probably encountered awful things before second some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient he discovers for example the victim s diary in her private bathroom despite the fact the the police the fbi and her own mother have all investigated the room before finally the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film despite the above criticisms mm is an engrossing story one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles who no longer seems like a hero brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film he pulls a gun on the man and for a relatively long amount of time struggles to decide whether or not to kill him he then leaves the building and calls the victim s mother in the middle of the night to basically see if she would support the action the entire scene is tense unpredictable and emotionally charged rarely anymore do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as mm with scenes like this did mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart this is a graphic oftentimes unflinching look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people if you re prepared for a film of this nature i give it an enthusiastic recommendation

ingredients down on his luck evangelist church synopsis sonny dewey robert duvall is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife farrah fawcett in bed with another guy in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy s head and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder and estranged from his wife and two kids to atone for his sins sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature the apostle e f as the apostle e f sonny s main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple but sonny knows his time is short one day the police will find him opinion this movie is a thought provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms i believe that robert duvall who is the producer director writer and main star of the apostle deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film duvall s portrayal of a true believer is authentic superb and inspired it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion as well as a portrait of a fallible complicated man driven by his beliefs incidentally in real life duvall was just as driven in getting the project underway since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost years before duvall was able to get it done paying for its production with his own money about five million dollars in terms of hard hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film similarly those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought provoking experience on the other hand the apostle s main strength duvall s preaching is also what limits the apostle s target audience in terms of plot and pure entertainment value the apostle is definitely not for everyone teenagers action fans comedy fans and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church in other words the apostle is a four star performance but with a very limited audience 
tone alone cannot sustain a film but it can go a long way if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story it scores immediate style points when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly literary what s eating gilbert grape is such a film it s a rich memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence gilbert grape johnny depp is a young man living in rural endora iowa facing incredible responsibilities as the man of the house since his father s suicide gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie leonardo dicaprio and help care for his extremely overweight mother darlene cates gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky juliette lewis a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down as he spends time with becky gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing slowly his resentment builds until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people director lasse hallstrom my life as a dog and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges screenplay based on his own novel endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real minor characters like crispin glover as the town s mortician are vividly realized and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen s desperately unhappy housewife one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off key high school band not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false the same can be said of the character of gilbert it s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line when becky responds to gilbert s description of his father with i knew someone like that once gilbert is a man harboring an ever growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty in one scene he allows local children to look at his mother through their window displaying her like a side show attraction his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie s repeated chants of we re not going anywhere but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer and it becomes clear that he is following in his father s footsteps in this regard johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface but he never gives in to one dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny joon and edward scissorhands depp s performance is overshadowed however by leonardo dicaprio s astonishing oscar nominated supporting work as arnie he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard pressed to spot a flaw darlene cates a first time actor brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert s tortured mother and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert s sisters only juliette lewis doesn t quite click playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion but it never lost me thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast this release proves well worth the wait 
 run lola run a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance for a berserk and retroactive minutes of non stop movement we follow a fiery haired heroine named lola franka potente as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve marks in time to save manni moritz bleibtreu from being killed by the dealer but in something of a pseudo groundhog day approach director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal in these trio of episodes we gradually learn the unique effects of fate for even if tiny changes are made in lola s journey the future can be seriously altered run lola run is an experience like fight club or the matrix in that each film takes you through a super charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways in addition all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack lola is no exception with stylish quick flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get go tykwer s world is a landscape of mood and color with brilliant shades of red and pink including lola s fiery hair used as effective symbolism throughout with it s visual style and mind blowing pace run lola run is one of the more invigorating movies of the year even more so when considering the fact it s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an minute time period as a heroine potente does little more than run wildly through the streets as the title suggests but she has a certain flair and charisma her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star meanwhile bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life both actors perform beyond the call of duty the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola and the outcome is ultimately rewarding several twists and turns are unique and unexpected the other characters lola runs into both purposely and inadvertently include her banker father herbert kraup and a friendly security guard armin rohde but aside from the two leads no one has more than a few minutes of screen time additional stars that couldn t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy who are both responsible for the film s eye catching visual elegance run lola run is subtitled so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning fast dialogue occasional sections of it are especially fast this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation most are just chess pieces in tykwer s elaborate game of visual presentation and he never really makes a significant move with any but the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay a few petty gripes aside this film is a wild exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality most people believe foreign films are mainly boring talky character studies perhaps run lola run will recharge their batteries not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny it also delivers a white knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character run lola run is exhausting 
 comedy rated pg runs about starring john goodman kathy moriarty and a bunch of teenagers directed by joe dante and written by charles hass summary lawrence woolsley john goodman brings his new horror film mant to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them quick and easy review i really enjoyed matinee the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely unlike many comedies this film tries and succeeds in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story the performances of all the principals are right on the mark particularly john goodman as the schlock master so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours longer more detailed review beware of spoilers the primary reason i enjoyed this film was that while being a comedy the film also had an intelligent story to tell too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh you watch the movie laugh a lot leave the theatre and take nothing with you matinee is not like that i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film but most importantly i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters the comedy of the film centers around goodman his character and the film he brings to key west i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today he is highly expressive both physically and vocally i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature however while the star goodman is actually not at the center of the film the movie is really the story of the four teenagers discovering who they are and what they want against a background where at any minute it could all end i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic they tried to block it out they tried to escape from the concerns of their world unfortunately it kept creeping back in particularly with the fear and the chaos of the time while the comedy centered on goodman and the drama on the teens there was a great deal of overlap several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy but it works here another reason i like this film is that i like b science fiction movies one of my favorite films to go watch is plan from outer space note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies but one of my favorite to see while mant never got made many films like it were and mant serves mostly as dante s homage to the b films he loves so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good humorous story this isn t a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent well thought out film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way enjoy 
every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio with every indication that it will be a stinker and to everybody s surprise perhaps even the studio the film becomes a critical darling mtv films election a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon is a current example did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened the plot is deceptively simple george washington carver high school is having student elections tracy flick reese witherspoon is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question way way high mr m matthew broderick sick of the megalomaniac student encourages paul a popular but slow jock to run and paul s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well for personal reasons the dark side of such sleeper success is that because expectations were so low going in the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be you can t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have election a good film does not live up to its hype what makes election so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from rushmore released a few months earlier the similarities are staggering tracy flick election is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play max fischer rushmore is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play the most significant tension of election is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student the most significant tension of rushmore is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student tracy flick is from a single parent home which has contributed to her drive max fischer is from a single parent home which has contributed to his drive the male bumbling adult in election matthew broderick pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he even gets a bee sting the male bumbling adult in rushmore bill murray pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he gets several bee stings and so on what happened how is it that an individual screenplay rushmore and a novel election contain so many significant plot points and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other made from two different studios from a genre the high school geeks revenge movie that hadn t been fully formed yet even so the strengths of election rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick witherspoon and newcomer jessica campbell as paul s anti social sister tammy broderick here is playing the mr rooney role from ferris bueller and he seems to be having the most fun he s had since then witherspoon is a revelation it s early in the year it s a comedy and teenagers have little clout but for my money witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination and once campbell s character gets going like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium then you re won over one thing that s been bothering me since i ve seen it there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film i suppose that coming from mtv films i should expect no less but the film starts off light and airy like a sitcom as the screws tighten and the tensions mount alexander payne decides to add elements that frankly distract from the story it is bad enough that mr m doesn t like tracy s determination to win at all costs but did they have to throw in the student teacher relationship even so there s no logical reason why mr m has an affair when he does there s a lot to like in election but the plot similarities to rushmore and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven mark this as a disappointment 
here is a film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop okay it isn t quite original considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species but it certainly is smart most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b horror films from the s and s and some even become them however as we learned with the small budget horror sci fi film sometimes expectations can be shattered a lot of criticism has gone against this film from what i have read so far anyway yep all two reviews and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory laughable pieces of trash but the thing is it isn t it s well made well acted and quite intelligent i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film but the species series isn t about the lack of these elements it s about how much it can get into one film and yet behind it all it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so species ii begins in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe many films especially sci fi ones create similar timelines as our realistic one but change it to fit the film s needs species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mars aboard is patrick ross justin lazard a very bright and very handsome astronaut patrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just wants patrick to succeed well it would seem that he has succeeded landing on the surface of mars he is the first human being to ever do so of course he isn t the first ever about a billion years ago an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life now of course the red planet is cold and rocky no life lives on it that is no visible life patrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collects samples from the ground he takes them aboard and puts them in storage unfortunately one of the samples contains a form of life and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship just prior to heading back to earth this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings they pass out for approximately seven minutes and then shrug it off as nothing because they can t even remember they blame it on a technical malfunction back on earth patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible as we know from the original this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet however the children that are bred are half human as their father is patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he finds it in eve natasha henstridge eve was cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien however this time around most of her alien urges have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant the project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from species and her motives seem respectable since she was involved with the original alien attack she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again and it has story wise species ii is much stronger than its predecessor but it is also much stronger than say aliens hey i love the film but you can t tell me it was strong on story what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars later it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it the script uses this effectively but also manages to provide a well balanced plot beginning with the first man on mars something i have always dreamed of seeing i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie and it does it quite well the characters are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do the only character that seems a little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he does there are the obvious flaws of course mostly lying in the technical aspects the special effects are only mediocre and some are just plain bad but for the most part they remain believable i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children also the most realistic ones are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someone s head being blown off however some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience including a menage a troi that is all but necessary many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence however i tend to disagree what were the alien films about and if an alien species ever did come to earth and their sole purpose was to destroy us wouldn t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store i didn t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with i just assume it is his part human side looking for the most beautiful one the acting is quite good for this kind of film it is a vast improvement over the first film at least the acting is the key element to this film if it was bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it was good it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens okay so it isn t that good george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting as his over the top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting natasha henstridge is limited this time around as she is usually enclosed in a cage however she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent oh yeah and she s quite fun to just plain watch marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film michael madsen is so so but he isn t annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality james cromwell has a small part but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor as i say any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance and he gives the film a more down to earth feel and of course justin lazard lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance but i think he is effective sure he is wooden but isn t that what his character is like the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done due to the couple s acting species ii is rated r for strong sexuality sci fi violence gore and language this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see more than likely they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives hell i don t even know if i will what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year i probably won t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series medak has also mastered the wonderful jump moments and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film scream still has the first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and a sure handed director species ii is exactly what these films should be entertaining 
in this good natured pleasent and easy going comedy bill murray ghostbusters plays grumpy weatherman phil conners who every year is sent to punxsutawney p a to report on groundhog day the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box and if he dosen t see a shadow it will be an early spring phil really hates the ceremony and not even his producer rita macdowell can change his mind however fate has a cruel trick for phil and he starts re living groundhog day over and over and over until he gradually likes it and rita falls in love with him groundhog day is a well written totatly unoffensive and funny comedy the screenwriters director ramis and danny rubin have written a funny warm but never overly senitmental comedy although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film ramis s direction also helps and although he dosen t try any flash director tricks the film is directed well enough and the jokes are set up well and the editing is also good especially when it shows one part of the day over and over again such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita the performances are also excellent bill murray is great fun and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth and delivers his lines in his usual smary style andie macdowell is good as rita although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film there is chemistry between the two leads thankfully otherwise the whole film would probably fall part chris elliot as the cameraman larry is also funny although you have to like his goofy style otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall the supporting cast aren t bad either with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist in fact there is not one dud performance in this film and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase overall there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all it almost seems perfect however the film can get a bit soppy sometimes and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over and over and over and over also there s not much of an music score and the music there is is pretty bad but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all overall then groundhog day is a funny smart and also has some room in there for some heart an excellent comedy overall rating 
eric rohmer s pauline at the beach is one of those small deliberately paced but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise but a lot happens to the characters emotionally the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast and centers on six different characters primarily pauline amanda langlet a wise beyond her years year old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin marion arielle dombasle on the first day at the beach marion runs into an old high school flame fedoore atkine and although he wants to rekindle their relationship she is more interested in an older more seductive womanizer pascal greggory who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor rosette while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy simon de la brosse pauline at the beach is not a film in which big dramatic things occur and there is not a clear cut tidy conclusion to the story instead it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life and the surprises come from little character details the film is quite talky and slow moving and so it is pretty safe to say it isn t for those who are only a fan of action movies but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big budget genre and see a good art film this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer s my night at mauds and s claire s knee that i have seen but his direction is assured and intelligent as is the screenplay which he also wrote pauline at the beach is a film worth seeing 
the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be in some ways in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint and its series sequel the return of the saint val kilmer plays simon templar an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others this movie closely resembles a james bond flick it has the classic bond symbols a man who can do just about anything and get away with it a woman whom the man persues a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests as a young boy kilmer s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name that of a catholic saint he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be this leads to a devestating mistake which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life kilmer s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak played by rade serbedzija during a press conference he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area avoiding guards cameras and many other potential obstacles once his mission is completed and he is safely home the fee is paid when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of million he decides to carry out only one more mission then retire dr emma russell portrayed by elisabeth shue has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia where millions are without heat and are freezing to death the only problem is tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal tretiak hires him to steal the equations small pieces of paper from shue one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions they are very convincing not only to the characters in the movie but to us kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue s character into getting to know him even more which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula when the two meet and end up having a sensual experience kilmer s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell as she is falling in love with kilmer s alter ego a traveling artist yet he must reach his goal of million which requires him to steal the energy formula putting his feelings aside shue s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces the names of the catholic saints together something no one else is able to do when she finds him they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak the saint is very action packed with few slow points the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments along the course of the movie there are even a few although brief moments of comedy these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer s extraneous very convincing disguises and personalities all in all a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non stop action 
the reunion film is not an original idea in any way shape or form it s been done throughout film history over and over again and has become one of the many sub genres like the prep school sub genre the angst filled teen sub genre and the slasher sub genre what makes peter s friends so remarkable is not how it doesn t follow the rules of this sub genre but how it follows it so well and creates characters that i wouldn t mind hanging with what are the rules of the reunion sub genre well you need a group of friends most of them married or at least dating and sometimes even married or dating eachother you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic the reunion has to bring them together seperate them with little crises then bring them back together because after all they re friends there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited eightly they re all unhappy or marginally so there s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that s built up over the years the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts sometimes internationally so the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends sometimes causing them to get together in dance song since it follows these rules so closely it will probably be and has been coined off as just a british big chill and in some ways it is both follow the rules as i said and both feature lots of bitching big confessionals and broken relationships but while the big chill was at least to me a tad too whiny and unsatisfying peter s friends hits its mark making this film funny dramatic and poignant the friends of peter s were all in the same theatre group back in performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus after peter s stephen fry wealthy father richard briers hardly on screen enough to register but oh well dies leaving a giant mansion to him he has to decide whether or not to keep it not sure what to do with it immeadiately he decides to throw a giant reunion party inviting back all his old chums of course all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule andrew kenneth branagh also directing here is an actor who s unhappily married to a tv star carol co writer rita rudner maggie emma thompson is a successfuly publisher of self help books but looks like she needs them more than her customers as she is lonely and unhappy roger and mary hugh laurie and imelda staunton who were also married in sense and sensibility are married and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died and sarah alphonsia emmanuel is as promiscuous as ever having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian tony slattery who s married and wants a divorce because of her giving her doubts as for peter things seem okay the film features lots of inner friend jokes and even some old theatre anecdotes which i at least find a lot of fun in as i ve done lots of theatre myself and there are big confessions brawls between the friends and by the end almost everyone is unhappy even though some have resolved their problems long before the end which i kinda dug the final twist would seem forced an anti climactic but for some reason i felt the same way the rest of the friends did maybe it s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique that s really what makes peter s friends so lovable the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes but when someone s in crisis can come together wonderfully for one another it s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends and these people are true friends not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the s a decade i grew up in unfortunately without taking us outside of the s there are some s classics and anti classics like tears for fears everybody wants to rule the world but unfortunately no stupid fun s songs i think if i ever did an s reunion film i d put some crap go gos song on or at least some good old come on eileen but this is the british s we re talking about oh well but anyway the direction is pretty good although nothing amazing branagh s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical but at least he s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman with lots of good one liners and even some really bad but good puns to mock the fact that andrew lives in l a peter while cutting some logs asks him is he has wood in l a and andrew says no but we have hollywood punishment like that the actors as in most speaking movies are better than their material though with some stand out performances to the six friends as well as the outsiders like slattery rudner and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter s mansion a little note should be made about hugh laurie s performance as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this i mean i ve never seen him actually act this dramatically peter s friends is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion although i don t know what kind i ll have like most people i don t look forward to my high school reunion because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that 
it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a i artificial intelligence just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home an outcast seeking family themes very familiar from most of spielberg s body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e t to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan naming just a few examples a i is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions and with the number of births limited by the government many couples are yearning for children and professor hobby william hurt has the solution a robotic boy named david haley joel osment who is programmed to love as a test david is placed with henry swinton sam robards and his wife monica frances o connor their natural born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness the first third of a i deals with david s life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son martin circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons he is abandoned and alone david highly influenced by the fairy tale pinocchio feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica s love for him the film s second act follows david s search for the blue fairy whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe jude law a robot who specializes in sex spielberg is at his top form in this sequence offering a brutal flesh fair where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers here is where kubrick s influence is strongly felt as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots the savagery conjures up images from the late director s a clockwork orange at about two hours and minutes the film begins to falter during the last minutes a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters it is all very anti climatic and jarring these scenes seem almost superfluous as if from a different film a i is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg rating it is a story combining hope and intolerance sacrifice and bigotry and while it does not coalesce perfectly the movie does offer some disturbing images but a i is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination it is this lad who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david a being created for the express purpose of loving he shines when with monica beaming with love as eager as a puppy to please after being left in the woods he is confused lost hurt focusing on one objective to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother s eyes law is pleasant as the care free robot who really doesn t understand david s quest but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey probably the toughest role is o connor s monica playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance but as a threat to her family she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action many of a i s futuristic sets are breathtaking especially a mostly submerged new york lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps a i is a flawed film and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering even subconsciously how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera would it have been darker more cynical we will never know we can only judge what is before us on the screen a collaboration of two cinematic giants a i is a most interesting and thought provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us 
meet joe black is your classic boy meets girl boy likes girl boy gets killed in horrible accident supernatural entity takes over boy s body supernatural entity falls in love with girl story based on the film death takes a holiday meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love william parrish anthony hopkins is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his th birthday he has built a huge media empire and raised two beautiful daughters allison marcia gay harden and susan claire forlani william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality the one situation he won t be able to talk his way out of and he has good reason to fear for death himself is stalking him however death has a deal to make death has taken possession of a man who has recently died brad pitt and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living in return william gets to live a few extra days of course he agrees death under the human name of joe black gets to experience life as a complete innocent he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter and he s not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love but is their affair doomed to an early demise at nearly three hours in length meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side though it never gets boringly lengthy instead the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere rather than being hurriedly rushed through it the romantic angle works well though surprisingly the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter this is most likely due to anthony hopkins who once again displays his superb acting skills william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life and doesn t want to let it go by contrast claire forlani is merely the romantic interest she gets to show joe the ropes of love but is hardly as interesting a character as joe black brad pitt seems a bit stilted granted he s supposed to be out of place but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role still he is able to hold his own and over the course of the three hours his character begins to grow on you the main character who seems out of place here is drew jake weber an ambitious executive in williams company who is joe black s main rival for susan s affections weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily but never distractingly so we never learn what is the exact nature of death or why he s never done something like this before it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices accents his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter and the ultimate resolution to one of the film s supernatural problems seems well somewhat superficial still even with the film s length it was a pleasant time at the movies something you wouldn t necessarily expect from a film about death but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow

in zoolander the world s most successful influential and intellectually challenged male model derek zoolander wonders is there more to life than being really really really good looking obviously the film s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature length movie out of his hilarious vh vogue fashion awards short film subject can there be more to this film than being really really really silly no of course not and it never aspires to be anything more much like derek zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie it s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy and it never produces any gut busting laughs except maybe a scene when derek s model roommates all die in a tragic gasoline fight accident a riotously funny take off of tommy hilfiger ads but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles wild characters and performances and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused better yet this exaggerated version of the original three minute skit is only blown out to an efficient minutes just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu will ferrell drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed enter derek whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel owen wilson takes the spotlight on the trail of mugatu s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries stiller s real life wife christine taylor and she s hoping to use mugatu s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme much like the austin powers films zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today wilson is hysterical as the young vain hansel ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant freakish mugatu in the same way dr evil upstages everyone in austin powers jerry stiller ben s dad who s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld makes a priceless turn as derek s slimy agent maury ballstein even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged large assed masseuse as for ben stiller it seems his derek has one gag he s stupid which plays out in some uproarious one liners unfortunately taylor seems out of place and out of her league here maybe it s just because i can t stop seeing her as marcia brady who she played in both brady movies making her unbelievable as a dowdy brainy plain jane who hasn t had sex in two years she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo who would ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role while zoolander is hardly highbrow its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days zoolander s no masterpiece but a very worthy distraction 
it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less than savoury character as mel gibson does in payback of course if i was being paid million for one month s work i d probably be willing to take risks as well but that s neither here nor there payback is based on a novel by richard stark apparently actually donald e westlake author of the grifters itself a fine crime film which was also filmed in the s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys lee marvin the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back by whom we don t know yet all we know is that gibson as porter isn t a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back and getting even in the process no matter what the consequences it turns out that the man he s after is val gregg henry his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers porter however is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet goes about exacting revenge on the double crossing val gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn t mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants you probably wouldn t see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat out of character role such as porter jim carrey won t be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried the cable guy anyone harrison ford s idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin which we won t mention further and has stallone ever really played a villain at all this is not to say that porter is a villain per se while he isn t the sort of character you wouldn t want to get on the wrong side of he s nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right hand men just to prove how mean they are porter is only trying to get back what is not so rightfully his which in a way is almost understandable payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy thriller which won t be remembered as being among gibson s most important work but is still one of the finer films he s done the only real problem with it is that while everything seems to work out in the end i was left feeling something was lacking was that all the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute and the final voice over doesn t ring true even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film noir style the rest of the film embodies the film just ends far too suddenly after a huge build up in the penultimate scenes a fine film even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending 
robert redford s a river runs through it is not a film i watch often it is a masterpiece one of the better films of recent years until it was my second favorite film of all time the acting and direction is top notch never sappy always touching a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because i was afraid it would just be really politically correct and tick me off all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased and enjoy it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears but certain memories should not often be rereleased in the last few shots you have to cry upon my first viewing i left bawling it is not flawless but it is so very good that you can t help but be effected the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental watching these shots of people who have been dead so long gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state like taking dope and immersing yourself in an alternative world that is what a river runs through it does it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self both times i ve seen it its been hard again to quote scorsese waking up but the dream is lovely 
the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it s adequately explained by the commercials with days to go until the election the president who we never see calls in political dirty tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a pageant a phony war against albania fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville with woody harrelson as the reluctant psychotic hero and if there wasn t anything more to the movie than this it would be a second rate heist comedy at best enlivened by great actors like sneakers goes to washington a heist comedy yup deniro and hoffman are stealing the election so to speak and the movie is more about how they do it and the fun they have doing it than anything else wag the dog succeeds because it s based one great truth the american people are stupid ok maybe it s not love thy neighbor as thyself or even two plus two makes four but a truth nonetheless any average person who thinks that they re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes moviemaking and the political process is invited nay challenged to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or hours straight watching c span when the house is in session and because we re so utterly predictably stupid hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo washington knows that we won t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies and deniro s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won t be able to locate albania on the map the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn t a light meaningless comedy about politics like speechless the michael keaton geena davis picture or from the level of light hearted politcal satire to near greatness nor is it a hard edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally deprived ethically challenged baby boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house like primary colors and yes i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out thanks for asking instead david mamet s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers schemes come off beautifully and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables without any of the violent rages it s all what do i love what is it that brings me joy baseball minus the savage bloody beating with the bat he threatens a lot of people mind you but he s doing it in a very nice polite way it s a very mellow restrained performance which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script hoffman on the other hand is giddy exuberant and joyous this kind of thing is what his character lives for and he s so excited that he can t even shut up even on the edge of disaster he s bright eyed behind oddly tinted sunglasses and positive insiders note that he s basing his character on some powerful but anonymous producer which may or may not be true but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets put on a show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them listen to them talk in that wised up mamet dialogue get to know them better which we don t anne heche is dead bang on in her portrayal of a political press aide cool and composed on the outside panicked and frenzied on the outside denis leary one of my favorite actors see the ref is the fad king who handles the profitable back end t shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative innovative ways to separate a fool from his money they could make a whole movie just about the fad king and i d go see it willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song to the weepy country waltz to the hilarious ballad of the green berets parody woody harrelson has a brief but memorable part as the overmedicated hero of the albanian conflict craig t nelson as the opposition candidate and the ever reliable william h macy as a wacky cia agent are given surprisingly short shrift one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems the trivialization of american politics the role of the press in dumbing down the issues the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars the list goes on we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don t 
much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of lolita made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made over its use of pedophilia and as such it s important to address it straight forwardly before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years lying around in vaults san a distributor and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit when seeing this film after all the hoopla keeping in mind that there are people namely me who are fans of the novel who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation well you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution what s even worse is that seeing this lolita especially the first time and if you re familiar with anything lolita is admittingly very anticlimactic this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it it s really quite a film perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne although really look at its competition flashdance fatal attraction and indecent proposal at least besides jacob s ladder i ve seen this lolita twice the first time i wasn t so blown away it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting the second time not really thinking about how i ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre it really affected me emotionally the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one which is why it s such a good novel and why this is such a good film the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young year old girl named dolores a k a lolita is great because it s not trash for the perverted but because it s about human obsession with things that are out of one s reach its protagonist the comically named humbert humbert is not your average pedophile but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology something that will destroy us but that we can t live without these ideas are all worked into this film nicely but done in a way that is not heavy handed at all but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating the focus of this film and the reason for making it it seems was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images and scenes which are blatantly over stylized the tone of the book is a comical one but it s also a tragic one and humbert telling the story from his perspective blows every single thing out of perspective humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed we get a sense that perhaps it s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original year old love and allows himself to embody her as lolita he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions and by the end he has nothing but overly dramatic feelings for her the story recognizes the extreme of this almost out of a test seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions and perhaps bring them to peace the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey we can easily sympathize and even identify with him the opening and final images of the film are the same and who hasn t done a similar action that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen the first time being filmed in shock by stanley kubrick who couldn t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do but did the next best thing he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general in that film he used the traps of society as benefits the studio demanded the final scene that of a heinous murder come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile and when you see it it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession the censors wouldn t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the um relationship between humbert and lolita so kubrick decided to play it as comedy but still allow the tragedy to seep through looking at these two versions especially after reading the novel and we all know that when we ve read a novel and see a film adaptation we are bound to be angered by any size differences it s really impossible to compare them they both go for different things and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was and although it s true that several scenes are similar and are thus up for comparison overall it s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is and i won t say that here however this film is pretty amazing mostly because hey i loved the book and this film nearly reminded me of it it doesn t have nearly as much wit a couple comical scenes and even a lot of good chuckles but just not totally witty but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had some of that is in the casting of the two leads jeremy irons with his deep soft british voice and gentle look is an amazing humbert he s droll in a very unique way and well no one can look distraught the way he does he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience and when he looks at lolita with love and she looks at him with lust you know that he s her prisoner for as long as he lives and dominique swain who plays the title character is rather incredible she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction bratiness and self centeredness that marks the character it s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert she loves the attention and knows that she can have her way with him at any time when he denies her something she blackmails him effortlessly a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic and when he stands up to her she weeps and runs away leaving humbert to follow her there are two other minor characters in the film one who s a road block in the beginning and the other who s a reappearing threat to the relationship the former is charlotte lolita s mother played by melanie griffith in the book charlotte is a monster of a woman overbearing constantly scolding her child overly religious and ultimately selfish and she s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal at least in the beginning as played by shelly winters in the original she represented all these qualities as played by griffith here she s about half of them it s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first and even though griffith is not really bad persay she s nothing more the other is clare quilty the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita and succeeds but at a price langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original quilty was a comic character in the original a threat in the form of many forms popping in states of rambling german proning and eventually drunk langella takes the other route allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending the exact opposite of what we thought of him as you can see most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter stephen schiff but just parts of a whole new look at the novel at least cinema wise this version is beautiful and perpetually saddening the camera movements are stylized and each shot is breathtakingly rich the acting is for the most part wonderful and when we watch it we really get a sense that for humbert who is telling the story the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita more importantly it takes us right up the brink of emotion then jumps right over it by the end with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn t regret we feel that we all lose to something we can never have 
do film critics have morals are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow naturally we don t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish secondly and along the same line we can t prejudge a film because of it s stars director etc the difference well in the first one we d go into a film thinking it s going to be dumb or it s going to be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb so i m not expecting much on the second hand we re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal grudge against the film company it s made by disney oh it s just a merchandising ploy then the actors jim carrey s in it it s gonna stink or the director who can t be that good this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint make sense ok but what about comparing isn t that kind of along the same lines when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer s credibility in one film to another they were involved in is that really fair sure in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more but what about jackie brown for example is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both i think it is and i ll tell you why a good critic should be able to view the film from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film sometimes that can be tough the acting was superb but i was bored or i loved it it was sooooo cheezy might be used to describe a film these are contradictions and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique but which is more important and which is better an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again getting back to the point my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway every average person out there who s interested in this film is likely to ask how does it compare to pulp fiction and so as a critic i m already responsible to ask that same question jackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the s who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character tarantino s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta s sudden revival in the movie industry and with talks of an oscar nomination the same is likely to happen for grier we ve made it thru comparison jackie is a year old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fiction s samuel l jackson and comparison ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half million dollars trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotics as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell s plans and not as friendly intended as we d hope he posts jackie s bail after she is put behind bars the thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and as we learn from his previous actions he s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze ordell won t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she s always done yet at the same time a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided it comes down to a simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help the law ordell or maybe just herself coming into play is another s veteran robert forster as jackie s bail bondsmen max cherry max s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance also involved is ordell s surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda a ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role but there s nothing more to her and therefore she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself de niro is a brilliant actor but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn t need a de niro to play him compared to pulp fiction comparison the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable in pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast the exception being grier tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth sadly grier too could have received a bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newly jarred perception of life jackson teams up with tarantino again but the chemical reaction isn t as awesome as the first time jules was the rambling bible quoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off and although jackson is really really good in jackie brown i don t think he s quite as irreplaceable in fact maybe a new face would have been better jackson could ve remained tarantino s jules and a new guy could have become ordell forever to remain so in our memories sadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just isn t as impressive and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning this is grier s film so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard s novel rum punch for those movie goers don t expect another pulp fiction and you ll be satisfied for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of s film making the directing has toned down a bit however yet we re still reminded that this is tarantino s movie thanks to odd split screen story telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints so getting back to the question that i began with this isn t pulp fiction at all it s good but it isn t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place this is a more conservative tarantino but not one that won t satiate true fans if you can realize that this isn t going to knock your socks off then you ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet after all we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy 
the long and illustrious career of robin williams which has included both forgettable turns like mrs doubtfire and flubber was punctuated with the actor s first academy award in for his role in good will hunting it was his first truly dramatic role since s dead poets society and critical remarks were unanimously positive his next role that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come was unfortunately lackluster and so after a six year stint as a comedic actor the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams williams is the title character hunter patch adams sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting we re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies it s at the institution however that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia s medical college where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating impersonal trade his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion and the movie climaxes with patch s appearance before the state medical board the characters are well defined in an oscar worthy sense although the script does not perform well as a narrative there s little story to be told outside of patch s skit length experiences the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters at medical school patch meets up with truman schiff daniel london an outsider like himself who relishes patch s zest for humanity the two instantly become the best of friends and it s easy to see why monica potter plays patch s love interest a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school for some reason he s attracted to her and although it never gets said the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view the script based on hunter adams own story works well this way the rest of the cast bob gunton as the villain professor in particular is solid director tom shadyac liar liar leads us in and out of patch s life in a sound intentional manner combined with williams presence on screen the movie rarely becomes boring patch adams lack of purpose is its major shortcoming and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours there s little feeling of continuity or the passage of time nevertheless it s an emotionally moving picture and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season it succeeds at everything it tries and only fails at the stuff it doesn t try in the first place by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams but more importantly it s entertainment for the entire family 
tempe mills cinema az this movie had us in non stop stitches from beginning to end all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie if you thought they were funny see the rest of the movie it s hilarious how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head bopping on snl to exactly one song easy write an interesting script around tried and true ideas add some good lines and satire and voil you end up with an excellent well done very entertaining flick will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day at night they pursue their life long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills ca the only disco act worth going to the only problem the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door the roxbury closes all the while bearing witness to guys with one hundred dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss the script authors steve koren will ferrell and chris kattan cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury their flower shop van is rear ended by richard grieco who fears a law suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star struck to think about the car accident they just had but not about getting into the roxbury grieco happily takes them in even introduces them to the owner which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers elisa donovan and gigi rice who bet their time and bodies on will and chris what follows are some of the best slap stick dancing routines ever the music is superb and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez s born to be alive the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by for example the bee gees and their stayin alive it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will and chris don t have any mone y and dump both on the spot even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away an art imitates life poke at shallow women it s a scene that s an approximate parody of the vinegar s own rolf luedeke s editorial this week national organization for men nom replaces now ted unabomber kaczynski himself rejected for not having money will identify well with this scene if he ever watches the movie of course the script wouldn t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good looking disco blondes proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby nevertheless will s father wants him to marry molly anyway but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest quarter exile during the wedding ceremony will s heart isn t exactly into getting married and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head bopping music will thinks worse of the knot tieing idea and runs to chris definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony i found this scene a riot however it went over brandi s head she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries instead the step in buddy weight lifter who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy and who has been lusting for a good looker for a long time but ready now to take anyone more art imitates life stuff not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world the idiots mother is played by loni anderson whose barbie doll looks don t play well anymore she s a bit old and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in need of a lot of laughs go with a date brandi laughed non stop as i did and a deaf mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for minutes 
john von neumann progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos even without recourse to faster than light travel you send out self replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information it may take decades centuries or millennia but it can be done with achievable technology and doesn t require a magical faster than light drive in the fifties british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer which would then engage in a real time dialog with the aliens exchanging information and technologies and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned about thirty five years ago the bbc contracted with astronomer writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini series called a for andromeda afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission the construction of a huge computer the computer s analysis of life on earth and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then unknown julie christie audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel andromeda breakthrough which played to equally high ratings dennis feldman whose previous credits include the golden child has never been noted for coherent well structured movie scripts they start out great and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl feldman writes good scenes but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie even with a previous version to use as a model now in species we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter gore and chases species features ben kingsley who is completely wasted in a badly written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script the species story is relatively simple we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since and have been receiving answers for two years note that in the s we really didn t know diddly about the human genome structure and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings even today all we can do is give information about dna and how it works not a copy of human dna because we don t have it analyzed yet the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race and doctor xavier finch played by ben kingsley is placed in charge of the attempt the script begins to go off the deep end at this point when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape shift into any of several ugly alien life forms the first half of the film has something to offer as sil the alien girl struggles with her multi form existence changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society with glaring gaps where her social skills should be her instincts are to mate and procreate and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area escaping from her birth laboratory in utah sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her she goes on an eating binge spins herself a cocoon and emerges as an adult played by natasha henstridge who goes a long way toward re creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in the pursuers michael madsen is an assassin exterminator forrest whitaker is a convenient empath psychic just as though the u s government actually had such people on call neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided whitaker s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek the next generation s counselor cleavage the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals too good to not work to the best of their abilities but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak h r giger s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly the main fault of species is lack of originality it starts out with a wonderful albeit borrowed premise and then doesn t live up to it all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes with a few monsters tossed in there is no buildup of tension and suspense no climax worthy of the name species is just a sequence of scare scenes stuck together the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes but not rescued by them on the other hand as an exercise in sci fi action adventure it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board but by and large it s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing my personal rating is three stars but knock one or two of those off if you don t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters mpaa classification r violence gore nudity sex language stars ben kingsley michael madsen forest whitaker alfred molina marg helgenberger natasha henstridge directed by

all great things come to an end and the dot com era embodies that perfectly beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot com darling the company kozmo com an online convenience store stocked with ice cream porn videos and other basic necessities of a urban dweller all hand delivered by couriers within an hour designed in by two college roommates joseph parks a year old goldman sachs banker and yong kang kozmo flamed out in three short years raising more than million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon com by december the company boasted employees in cities its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention the company was set for an ipo in may until april the day the stock market took its first big dive ending the internet era by april kozmo was out of money and ceased operations unlike the earlier similar documentary startup com which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot com govworks e dreams focuses both on its original founders especially park and on the common folks that ran the day to day operations the contrast is amazing showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing the film s director wonsuk chin too tired to die expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on the spot interviews with the bike messengers general managers and floor staff that kept kozmo humming the film s images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding to a degree the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic type businesses in the film s final interviews with park we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don t return phone calls in the end the name of the game was profit and if you couldn t make money even the dreamers got the axe screened at the th annual mill valley film festival 
andrew lloyd webber s musicals preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as oklahoma or the slapstickness of shows like a funny thing happened on the way to the forum they instead tackle hot issues from our past and view them differently and pack them together with redundant catchy music as well as thoughtful lyrics like jesus christ superstar which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective in the cool tune superstar a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn t spread his message wider evita takes an inventive stance on its topic this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator juan per n eva who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention much like the woman playing her madonna although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent among other things evita deals with the rise and fall of eva per n a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan jonathan pryce then died at the young age of creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di the two do share a bit in common although it wasn t like di slept to the top webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals but they always have a point for doing it here they wish to expose her for what she is but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks her lying and covering up for her fascist husband but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions and her death was very sad it s also a musical with almost no words not unsung the film plays like a rock opera much like their jesus christ superstar with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience but also a very entertaining one after all this is a musical and webber s musicals never undermine this they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth walking on a fine line between the both and never stumbling on either side this is why the beginning of evita is kind of a let down okay it is a let down i m not saying the opening moments are bad because they re pretty good but what comes after is a lifeless un entertaining and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer jimmy nail into taking eva to buenos aires after a one night stand in the musical it s a fun energetic sequence culiminating in the show stopper buenos aires which is also lifeless then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer instead of her leaving him where she ends up singing the sad tune another suitcase in another hall which was meant for a later character screwed over by eva the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft seeming like parker and oliver stone who adapted it for the screen are afraid to present her for what she is even while it s being narrated by a hater of eva s the omnipotent antonio banderas who presents her in a negative light for a while it looks like alan parker can t pull it off however the film pulls itself together in a flash and after that song is over and the giddily nihilistic song goodbye and thank you where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend is magnificent darkly comical and just gleeful from this point on the film is hypnotic satisfying and satirical no more punches are thrown and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact we see eva woo and marry juan get him out of jail rise to stardom falter a bit come back and then gradually die of cancer i think it was because of cancer more importantly many of the themes from the musical carry on with this as well as some filling in the gaps reconnassaince work juan who is pretty underwritten in the musical is given some extra scenes and exposed as what he was for eva an accessory a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan and understand his sadness more than we did before from the goodbye and thank you number on the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation and saved a government even while it left the nation s people downtrodden but despite this the nation still loved eva and when she slipped into death the world mourned her because she was a star that s when our narrator ch comes out to show that she wasn t the great woman she really was and expose her fame describing this character is difficult mainly because he has no real realistic background he s said to be based on the revolutionary ch guevera but the two probably could have never met like they do in the film but he serves as a perspective on eva but even his perspective can t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death alan parker no stranger to bizarre musicals he s done fame the committments bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall the latter which is absolutely brilliant nails the film exposing everything for what it is we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should by the way it is presented his direction is manipulative for a reason to show the mourning for what it is and there is energy throughout with lots of bright colors and scenes which are cinematically entertaning as well as enriching and deep such as the balcony scene where she sings don t cry for me argentina and her death sequence which is poignant becuase of how sad it is madonna s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly remaning there for the rest of the film at the beginning she looks like she s too busy concentrating on her singing to act but she eventually gets it right though never really getting the presence of say patti lupone who did the role in its american premiere back in the late s her death though is brilliant her singing could be better though i know she took lessons to improve her range and all but it still sounds like she s trying to hard she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding like patti lupone i heard her sing on an old evita cd and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her but it s generally very good although not up to the brilliance the role really requires antonio banderas who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days i m one of the few people who thinks he rocks is extremely comanding in his performance presenting a lovable narrator his singing is very good though nothing compared to the original mandy patinkin he does have a pretty good singing voice and a great range and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome although very brief at times in his role as juan seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade although it gets off to a rocky start rocky s polite for what it really is it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical like the other musical released in woody allen s everyone says i love you it s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance 
i hate to burst your bubble but after all the star power mega bucks screenwriters directors and cool trailers men in black is not the best movie of the summer it s pretty good in it s own right yes but i would probably split the best movie honors among face off spawn con air and maybe event horizon it s main problem is that it s quickly forgettable and i can t remember one truly good scene from it from con air it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt in spawn it was the living room hell conclusion at the end in event horizon it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell s forces and all of face off was pretty dang good but as for men in black the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches i remember it not for it s humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted and yes i did see mimic which is something i ll touch on in a later review back to men in black is it just me or does that sound funny i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the th grade and read magazines like wizard etc for those of you who aren t comic geeks wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars what the new yorker is to high society what boy s life is to boy scots okay that one was pretty pathetic few people know this but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was while not honest politician rare very hard to find this was after the release of the high grossing batman forever and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o donnell were being considered for the roles in the comic book there were no black men in black kind of weird huh all i can say is thank god they didn t cast chris o donnell i know i can t be the only person on the planet who thinks he s an annoying preppie little snot sorry my apologies to o donnell fans i actually had a th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him anticipating rather craftily that if the movie was a big hit it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely he decided not to sell them to me because they were innappropriate hmm so now you re probably wondering why i ve wasted about paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years good question i ll move on to the movie now as you probably already know will smith and tommy lee jones agents k and j respectively belong to a top secret agency known as divison or it s nickname mib men in black men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear and they re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they re here on earth not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the people in the world who haven t seen this movie but a basically big roach type bug lands in a redneck farmer s yard inhabits his body and attempts to destroy the entire universe not bad eh i have no idea why i just typed that i m not even really paying attention anymore the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black i found their main headquarters to be boring as were the cool weapons they had the noisy cricket just plain sucked no matter what anyone said and the movie definitely surprised me in tone although it probably shoudln t have it s director barry sonnenfield is known for black humor directing both addams family movies this movie was basically a black comedy not an action sci fi like i expected from the trailers don t get me wrong on what i think of this movie it s not bad i gave it it was mostly entertaining throughout it s run and had a very good ending although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it my diagnosis for this picture a good weekend rental but not worth a movie ticket of course the movie is now long gone from theaters but that s beside the point i think 
in magic town jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a perfect town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll takers care about however as time progresses and he finds himself falling in love with the town and a woman he begins to see that what he s doing is wrong the plot is standard stuff but that s not important in a film like this it s the calibre of the actors that make or break it obviously since stewart stars that s practically a non issue he s great in the film as usual there s just something about him that always manages to be endearing even when he s deceiving the town folk you re always on his side and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition the film was directed by a longtime frank capra script writer and it shows this is the type of feel good picture that capra is famous for by the time the end shows up on screen everything has been wrapped up very nicely there are no loose ends and virtually every character gets a happy ending those that deserve one anyway in this age of cynicism it s refreshing to see a movie so upbeat magic town is a delightfully entertaining motion picture if you believe all old movies are slow paced you d be well advised to check this one out 
when i saw the trailer for this film i laughed harder than i had in quite some time while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good i m happy to say that there s something about mary is not one of those trailer let downs in fact watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours the film opens up in flashback to at a high school in cumberland rhode island ted stroehmann ben stiller is a social reject who can t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren w earl brown who s being harassed by one of the school jocks it seems warren s sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed with ted s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother despite a very real chance of getting beaten up mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom ted was just flattered that she even knew his name unfortunately prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper at which every man in the theater will wince and is sent to the hospital fast forward to the present where ted has cleaned himself up now writes for a magazine but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past years mary whom he hasn t seen since that fateful day with the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon to track down his only love however when pat finds mary he falls for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affections there s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin not exactly intelligent comedies they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co workers to think you had such a great time watching them with their current film the farrelly brothers have come up with something you ll not only enjoy but also won t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles from the subtle to the ridiculous and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films they almost all work i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on one minute you ll be laughing at something ted says and the next you ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary s apartment one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller he is perfectly cast in the role of ted because he s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation ted s a nice fellow and tries to do his best but for some reason or another things just don t always work out it s comical but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top actually i ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid eighties the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise paul newman film the color of money entitled the hustler of money in it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played by john mahoney to become a big time bowling hustler it was parody at its finest more of which showed up in the short lived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late early like the critic which aired on abc then fox i still mourn that show s cancellation cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper thin at times however diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why she s got guys just falling over each other to be with her heck i even found her laugh to be cute even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn t change and you know it s really true he and ralph macchio must hang out or something maybe they live in dick clark s pool house anyway here s another good piece of casting as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary s heart the supporting performances are also good chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and less annoying than in cabin boy lin shae who plays mary s neighbor magda and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin provides some good laughs especially in scenes with her benji like dog which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film lee evans as mary s friend tucker displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren t any noticeable times where the film drags the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot relevant information right toward the camera it s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film after that it got a little annoying and it s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow fortunately filled with sight gags humorous lines and solid comedic acting there s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater 
i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding it contains parts of bringing up baby any hepburn tracy film part of the plot of war games cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday elevator shaft action train action and murder it is cute funny suspenseful a little bit sexy a little bit one of the bad guys was a surprise the pace is fast enough there are some action scenes i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together i really identified with the julia roberts character wishful thinking i know but i do have better hair her hair a very dull dark brown has no color she could use some highlights they both do fine with their roles he s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she s a hotshot cub reporter with the chicago globe they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie i like the one story focus other actors include charles martin smith as roberts boss olympia dukakis as nolte s coworker nora dunn also with the chronicle and marsha mason as a congresswoman basically this movie is reasonably fun there is a serious mystery to solve and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously i do give successful comedy high marks 
every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre with dramas it was citizen kane with arthouse it was pulp fiction and with comedy it was well that jim carrey guy okay so he s not a movie but he did have a huge influence on the genre not to mention an expensive one sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big sprawling motion picture event as did forrest gump four years ago with action films it was aliens whic was released to much hype seven years after it s equally innovative parent alien directed and written by james cameron t judgement day the abyss true lies the authority on action films it was a masterful encore to his sci fi thriller the terminator while the original alien film was a dark enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew james cameron took the big budget action film with aliens which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing although on a much larger scale and boy did he take that route i d say at about mph or so the film opens years after the original with lt ripley weaver being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel if you ll recall at the end of alien ripley the only surviving member cryogenically hibernated herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship unfortunately she thought she d only be out for a couple of weeks once she s returned to earth ripley is quickly interrogated by the company who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy in truth they believe her as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an alien advisor it seems that the colony planet was a once breeding ground for the nasty aliens and now all communication with the planet has been lost it doesn t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next ripley agrees and before you can say big mistake she and the half dozen marines plus the slimy corporate guy reiser who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve are off to the colony when they arrive they find the planet in ruins only one survivor is found a little girl newt who confirms that yes the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system and soon enough the marines come under attack from the aliens what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci fi movie the action scenes cameron directs them so skillfully and so suspensefully that you re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around which features in my opinion the best fight scene ever recorded on film as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death many people will tell you that this film while being a great action film has no real drama and is all cliches well they would be wrong my friends if this film had no drama then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the academy awards that s right best actress you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f x has got to be good in short aliens combines all the right elements great action and f x drama a good plot good dialogue and great villains into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time then again maybe not movies rise and fall from glory and sad to say aliens was wrestled from it s throne of best action movie by another cameron film t judgement day in so who will be the next king well let s wait until december th and see yet another james cameron film the highest budgeted film of all time titanic to make that decision i can t wait 
the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now it mu t be found so what exactly is the fifth element after seeing luc besson s ambitious much shrouded in secrecy science fiction fantasy i could not help but be let down by the actual answer which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps the actual storyline is the most conventional dismayingly so element pun intended of the film speaking in the vaguest possible terms the basics of the plot are as follows in the year a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth and only the four elements earth wind fire and water united with a fifth element can stop it figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas bruce willis a shady southern drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg the hilariously hammy gary oldman picking up where he left off in besson s the professional a priest ian holm and a mysterious creature named leeloo milla jovovich all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming and unsurprising fashion but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest what remains interesting and exciting however after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil director of photography thierry arbogast visual effects supervisor mark stetson and the crew at digital domain the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last the frenzied cityscape of new york with its vibrant day glo colors tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds and the swarm of cars cabs and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways is absolutely breathtaking to behold especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren t equally as interesting and are they ever in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world from bulky robots to dog like mangalores the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean paul gaulthier best known for creating madonna s pointy bustier get up in her blonde ambition tour gaulthier s outlandish creations such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps feel more at home in besson s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film while besson s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience for all its imagination certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film ruby rhod chris tucker a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed at first this character s hyper energy is funny but the act wears out its welcome very quickly not irritating but just as strange is a musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva maiwenn lebesco who sings and dances an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno the tune as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra s innovative score is haunting but it is also completely jarring then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout which too often are silly and forced a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny to boot the story s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element while still visually and aurally spectacular the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be the big serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward as such at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself who told me in the lobby following the screening imagine that the filmmaker watching the film with the enemy the critics that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half now titled mr shadow is still waiting to be made still despite the story problems the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson rarely does a filmmaker s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious undiluted glory it is a fascinating example of how of one artist s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams 
this three hour movie opens up with a view of singer guitar player musician composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members all the rest displays a compilation of footage mostly from the concert at the palladium in new york city halloween other footage shows backstage foolishness and amazing clay animation by bruce bickford the performance of titties and beer played in this movie is very entertaining with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil frank s guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix i ve ever heard bruce bickford s outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with zooms morphings etc and actually it doesn t even look like clay it looks like meat 
i ve never been a member of the robin williams fan club a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way and i sometimes feel as though i m watching a year old class clown in his films williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy feely emotion leading to wildly uneven performances mrs doubtfire seemed ready made for the same problems but instead it proves to be williams best comic screen project yet while it still contains some characteristic self indulgence mrs doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly laugh comedy served up with high energy williams stars as daniel hillard a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda sally field and she files for a divorce unemployed living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children daniel decides to respond to miranda s ad for an afternoon housekeeper he turns to his brother frank harvey fierstein a theatrical makeup artist and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire a matronly year old englishwoman daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda s flirtation with a wealthy client pierce brosnan to spend time with the children and to learn something about responsible parenting all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best mrs doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work and basically it does so the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that s instantly believable it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film making dustin hoffman s dorothy michaels look like milton berle more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell it s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn t recognize any of the voices as her husband s perhaps the biggest contrivance we re asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs doubtfire in a few minutes there s more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask fortunately these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll during the film i was generally too busy laughing after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams riffing mrs doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place daniel s frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful as is the climactic restaurant sequence even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away clearly most of the credit for doubtfire s success goes to robin williams it took putting him in drag but for once he plays a comic character that isn t just robin williams with a different name he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul mouthed wisely he never aims for saintly his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity it s one of mrs doubtfire s charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect just people trying to be better as miranda sally field is solid in a background role and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu the children are also good although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing it s easy to see mrs doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over and it s true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common but mrs doubtfire manages to carve out its own space particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge s decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda s relationship there s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs doubtfire but there are plenty of laughs and good comedies are always in short supply and it s nice to see robin williams just act for a change 
billy bob thornton who had a sudden rise to fame with s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer is becoming one of the most versatile and most accomplished american actors around at the moment as jacob the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton s hank thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers three men hank paxton jacob thornton and their friend lou brent briscoe stumble upon a plane wreck which upon closer inspection yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money jacob and lou want to pocket the cash hank the smarter and perhaps more naive of the three insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find eventually they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found and then split the money three ways things start going wrong though with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan disaster is sure to strike director sam raimi of the evil dead and darkman fame has made an excellent and thought provoking film worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come scott b smith s screenplay based on his novel which i haven t read is a fine example of escalating tension while it does remind one of danny boyle s shallow grave without the abundance of black humour it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality or the lack thereof found in a film with this subject matter alar kivilo s cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen s fargo with the bleak snowy landscape almost becoming another character danny elfman also does well with his moody finely written score if there s a flaw in the film it s that it goes on for just a little too long just when we think that they are about to wrap things up raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further while this isn t really a bad thing it did become a little frustrating at times this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand the performances are excellent with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene stealing turn as hank s scheming wife this is an excellent showcase for thornton s fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films fingers crossed though that this doesn t stop him from making another evil dead sequel 
 the tailor of panama is a different kind of spy movie despite the presence of pierce brosnan there is nary a hint of james bond flash here instead of big action scenes leering super villains and empty headed femme fatales we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation based on the novel by john le carr who also co wrote the screenplay the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year a solid well told story brosnan plays andy osnard a british operative walking on thin ice his british superiors ship him off to panama making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co workers and his new home base when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that since the creation of the panama canal the structure is the sole connection between north and south america he barely keeps from yawning brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end searching for a way to get information on the government osnard sets his sights on harry pendel geoffrey rush an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite harry claims to be a transplant from britain s renowned saville row but osnard knows his secret the tailor is an ex con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle s shop in an insurance scam he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm osnard offers harry a way out he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele eager to comply harry offers what he knows then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing before long he is forced to spy on his loving wife louisa jamie lee curtis an aide to the canal director harry s little lies build eventually taking on a life of their own osnard turns in reports about the silent opposition a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal the bogus revelation proves explosive leading to meetings in washington d c over how to best protect the vital waterway meanwhile osnard wallows in his newfound status enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co worker and harry grows ever more fretful fearing the consequences if his clients not to mention his wife learn about his lies geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor rush makes harry a credible figure presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity after gaining fame playing larger than life characters rush flips everything around for this role using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems although she gets far too little screen time jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her of the central characters she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self confidence curtis is one of my favorite female actors whiplash smart sultry and charismatic she deserves more than supporting roles speaking of supporting characters there are some great ones here harold pinter is amusing as harry s uncle benny who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr strangelove school of armed patriotism but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson both outstanding as two wounded activists their presence adds weight to the story reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there the metropolis described by one character as casablanca without heroes pulsates with life underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people the tailor of panama succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment 
set in the late s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie less than zero american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie genre that ellis helped to create christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc e and his colleagues it seems that bateman is a serial killer and unfortunately for his contemporaries his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out but i soon forgot about the novel and didn t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore i picked it up and read it but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers the movie has a similar effect but at least it s less cryptic than ellis novel for once a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does as a result the film is immensely more entertaining lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films having picked up kevin smith s catholic rattling dogma and here with american psycho there is no difference screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women and initial reports said the film was unwatchable thankfully it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park bigger longer uncut side note co writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill fated acquaintance of bateman s who after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute proclaims that she s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner the writer director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy is a lesbian it s a subtle in joke and it s one i found to be pretty humorous despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up and comers including reese witherspoon most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos the real draw here is christian bale and his over the top performance as patrick bateman whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger one sequence in particular involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song hip to be square right before burying an axe in a co worker s head features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film side note despite the fact that huey lewis hip to be square and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film don t expect to see them on the soundtrack release huey lewis expressly requested that his song featured in a rather large set piece in the film much akin to the use of stuck in the middle with you in reservoir dogs not be included on any soundtrack release i m assuming that collins requested the same on a similar note whitney houston s cover of the greatest love of all is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source apparently houston wasn t as open about the use of her song as the others were a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film s release that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film don t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i m still undecided there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops old ladies and cleaning staff with equal gusto the scene seemed very dream like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying as an example bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence though comic throws the film off balance which i suppose was the intention other than the few flaws i have mentioned american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman s reality i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such it may not change anyone s life but it will certainly have an effect i know i will certainly hear hip to be square in a different context the next time i hear it r 
do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs do you well as this movie shows us they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring unfortunately there s a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside feeling sorry for ourselves a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing and janeane garafolo s character abby relates to it well like a certain oversized teenage movie critic she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive and the men seem to be backing her up on that meanwhile her gorgeous neighbor nora uma thurman uma being the only woman s name worse than nora attracts men like flies as abby tells her you burp and they think it s cute you barf and they line up to hold your hair back but nora s down on herself for being too shallow and superficial we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby s talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound oh come on any idiot knows how to handle that problem he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person abby though knows her body doesn t match her personality and that she probably won t have a chance with him once he sees her so she gives him nora s body description and stands him up nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful she s not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person but he doesn t suspect anything realizing he s not living in a three s company episode the charade continues with abby furthering the relationship over the phone including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex masturbation sequence and nora furthering it in person while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man like sleepless in seattle this comedy romance is predictable all the way through but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom the truth about cats and dogs isn t quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be but it handles well a theme i could identify with the thing is i find janeane garafolo rather attractive she s no uma but i m sure in real life she d have no problems attracting men i on the other hand couldn t attract a man to save my life and am rather proud of that fact 
bruce lee was a bigger than life martial artist and actor bruce s unique character i e self produced sound effects etc and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor james lee the story is told from his wife linda s point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee s life however you can t help but like whenever the fight scenes are on what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee s life before he became famous scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the all white students cheerleaders and athletes it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes in conclusion the movie was well made it produced a realization of who bruce lee was and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor and the fighting scenes were all excellent so go see it and enjoy the movie p s if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven 
written by mark rosenthal and lawrence konner starring charlize theron bill paxton david paymer as reviewed by james brundage i m beginning to get fed up over my four years as a critic the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films the good balances the bad i try to see both in equal proportions but disney s mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven t seen a truly terrible movie it s a backwards machismo i suppose the urge to see the things which you so loathe but i need to see a bad film every once in a while and you know what mighty joe young doesn t qualify far from being bad mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie it s enjoyable appropriate cute cuddly and all of those other things that i ve been seeing in every movie since a bug s life mighty joe young tracks a pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in california for safe keeping okay a little unrealistic but who ever said a kid s movie had to have the slightest hint of realism the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist esque hatred of poachers woman of the wild motif the second half is a straight up parody of king kong awestruck onlookers and all mark one down i m feeling relaxed it is as a point of fact an extremely un creative movie but as a vetern i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn t count for as much as it should so that saves mighty joe from my wrath although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment this is not the film to take a girl on a date to it s not the film for you it s the film for you and your family when you re right alongside your kid all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick it becomes fun all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch 
although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama the sopranos analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it s own right billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol who new patient happens to be gangster boss paul vitti de niro ben wants nothing to do with vitti as he s about to get married to laura macnamara kudrow and having a gangster as a patient wouldn t really help but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out all done in a comic fashion of course although never brilliant analyze this is also never rubbish which makes for a fun ride billy crystal who hasn t had a good role since city slickers way back in the early s is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act he s pretty funny while he does it and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers he s pretty funny robert de niro is hilarious as vitti playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny he s a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine lisa kudrow barely seen as crystals estranged wife to be basically reprises her phoebe role from t v series friends which is getting rather tiresome and doesn t come off well on the screen the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas and are all funny caricatures especially vitti s bodyguard jelly joe viterelli the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie but with laughs instead of hard ass talking it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film but it strangely fits in spoofs are made of famous gangster movies including a nice parody of the godfather the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun there s also some odd plot points fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script unfortunately this is hollywood so we will never know harold ramis best known as egon from ghostbusters has a deft touch with directing comedy as shown in the immortal groundhog day and the less immortal caddyshack all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience the script written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan starts off funny remains funny for the most of the film but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory the film is short however and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll analyze this is a good comedy and is certainly worth watching robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it even though it does seem forced or like a parody although i think this was intentional crystal is his most likeable in years kudrow is given as little screen time as possible which is a good thing and de niro is just awesome it s no goodfellas and it probably won t be remembered as much as groundhog day but analyze this is a well done comedy that won t leave you feel cheated 
the word rest in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all what does takes place is more based on character development the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people nick beth carol and sid what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield arizona to butte montana and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different carol is nick s ex girlfriend and beth s best friend sid is a joint smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in obviously based on a stage play the problem with the movie is that there s a lot of things left out it s not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other the reason why nick was fired from his job isn t mentioned and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery when he hasn t seen them for many years set in a small fictional town in arizona was a good move since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings the name of the city is not important this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with but i ll keep an eye on her in the future interesting trivia this was rated r in the us but rated barntill ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it 
after the press screening of moulin rouge i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues everyone seemed a bit numb understandable after sitting through a barrage of often incongruous sounds and images a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production while a woman who flat out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye when one fellow quietly stated i ve never really been a fan of musicals the statement surprised me because even though the story is told almost completely through song i didn t think of it as a musical there is so much going on in moulin rouge that musical seems too small a term to cover it moulin rouge is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience australian director baz luhrmann the man behind strictly ballroom and romeo juliet fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork opulent imagery and songs ranging from the sound of music to smells like teen spirit sumptuous and beautiful vulgar and overdone moulin rogue travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with years worth of catchy tunes operates on the random setting oh and it has a story as well it was the summer of love christian ewan mcgregor is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris to write about truth beauty freedom and love where he encounters a group of bohemians led by henri de toulouse lautrec john leguizamo christian meets satine nicole kidman a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor at once fragile and vivacious the dazzling red haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler jim broadbent christian writes an opus modestly named spectacular spectacular zidler quickly finds a backer the wealthy duke of monroth richard roxburgh but there s a catch the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine as if all that isn t enough satine has a cough and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land like a teeter totter moulin rogue moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales together they dance while serenaded by the man in the moon alessandro safina provides the vocals apparently transported from the classic georges m li s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky other scenes merely traffic in everything and the kitchen sink overload the cavorting of toulouse lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy accompanied by cartoon sound effects is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like bewitched beat into the ground of course sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind we never heard from baz to turn it down one of the actors told the los angeles times it was always more more the director even sent a note to his cast reading i dare you to make me say you ve gone too far the musical numbers reflect his attitude one knockout piece the elephant love medley incorporates the beatles all you need is love u s in the name of love dolly parton s i will always love you and elton john and bernie taupin s your song need more how about diamonds are a girl s best friend spiced with portions of material girl luhrmann s cast offers a wide variety of approaches that together add up to something messy but often wonderful ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian emphasizing the sincerity of the love struck poet mcgregor s singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments once labeled the ice queen nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling yet tender performance she handles the songs adroitly although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler wait until you see him perform like a virgin as the buffoonish duke richard roxburgh proves to be the film s weakest link although i m sure he was simply following instructions i suspect moulin rogue will be one of those love it or hate it films while i didn t completely love it i most certainly liked it a lot over the course of a year i see well over movies and most of them look like xeroxes of each other moulin rogue is an original and an original even a flawed one is a thing to be cherished

i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with but twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter there is one small quake then another quake then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in hours a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall then it starts the volcanic eruption i liked this movie but it was not as great as i hoped i was still good none the less it had excellent special effects the best view the helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos also there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting so it was good 
life is beautiful is a rare treat a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful or even worse humorless it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce stirs in a little poignancy and ends up a very enjoyable movie it s an italian film but don t let that discourage you subtitle phobes will be missing a wonderful experience life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy with the clownish but good natured guido roberto benigni arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle the year is and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams dora nicoletta braschi their romance seems to be picture perfect with only one stumbling block she s already engaged to another man can guido overcome the odds and win his girl what do you think however five years later things have taken a turn for the worse in italy the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue giorgio cantarini who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp unable to protect his boy in any other way guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game with points awarded for such tasks as hiding being brave and being very very quiet as you can tell from the description life is beautiful has two very different tones but manages to excel at both of them as a romantic comedy it is sweet and funny as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair it is touching roberto benigni s work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin s and it is easy to see why he is able to run the gamut of comic expression from slapstick to farce with a warm hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero s triumph of the underdog spirit life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust however it is able to successfully navigate the minefield without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears with life is beautiful benigni has created a triumphant but bittersweet comedy it s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i ve had at the movies this year 
this is a film about secrets some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl frances boyd ashley others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines stephen ramsey the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healy louie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work and still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line receiving a summer grant to study chemo electric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together as their three year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab which is off limits to her as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses his main argument is that this is what the public wants they don t want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments they just want the benefits of science that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science science as a business as opposed to the good science science that cares about the small farmer which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins the third view in all this is the artist s represented by lillian who points out that the artist s work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly why shouldn t the same be true of the scientist she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public questioning what is good or evil in society something that bad science has completely ignored geoffrey impatient to get ahead with his research feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on as he contacts one of the company s higher ups to argue his case but decides he can t wait any longer for their help so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog of frances a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car he is spotted by alex and one of his co workers and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife afraid that alex will spot what he is doing as he rushes away from the area in the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart of the film as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything the scientists engage in a rational argument highlighting their different points of view while lillian reacts in an emotional way siding mostly with david s view but coming at it from a much different angle it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies that the director s point of view is absolutely right is beside the point the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one dimensional characters geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster alex vine was likened to his last name the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex s apartment geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it and mercifully the dog dies the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage but she also fails to respond to david s loving gesture for her to stay with him instead opting to head back to the city the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way what is progress what can one expect out of life is the small farmer about to become extinct the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions leaving no room for deeper arguments is the shame of this decent and smart film that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me as i don t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit that inspite of its shortcomings it was worth seeing because of its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso s guernica had for him both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on the pain that lillian feels as she forgets about her desires to raise a family and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song make the world go away blares out from the background after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband all in the name of science had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science perhaps the most pertinent question the film asks requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business as the question becomes can science be happily married with art 
titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it s upsetting that it isn t the film which cost million to make and could of put th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it sunk pun intended is a labour of love for cameron who wrote and directed the film we all know that big budget dosen t mean great film see waterworld but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic but sadly titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece although it is one of cameron s best films the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic they find a safe and inside a picture of a woman the woman in the picture an old winslet tells the explorers that the picture is of her the explorers invite her over and she then tells her story of titanic in the flashback dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson who after winning a poker game wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic leaving liverpool to go to america also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater winslet who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen t love at all cal hockley zane so her family can remain rich she nearly commits suicide on the ship but jack comes to the rescue saves rose they fall in love and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them oh yeah and the ship sinks and that is the main problem with the film and which stops it from being a work of genius the story and script both by cameron are both weak the story is full of cliched characters the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry the poor boy with heart the stuck up mother and poor dialogue the script consists of lots of in jokes of how the boat won t sink and most of the dialogue is pretty basic it s a shame really as the audience does have to sit through hours of this film without good dialogue a film could become a very long very boring film like camerons own terminator but luckily there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear firstly there s cameron s direction there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end there is a lot of mayhem and panic all done very well by cameron it s a scary sight watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below thanks to cameron s direction then the audiences attention is held for the full hours minutes to support the directing are the excellent cast working very well with their underwritten characters dicaprio is good although he only looks years old his performance of a over excitiable yet also well mannered boy is excellent and he also has some funny lines winslet is great also and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth zane is deliciously evil as cal saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash the audience really does come to hate him he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he s in like dead calm but he does it really really well also worthy of note is kathy bates edward scissorhands as a loud mouthed american finally the icing on the great things cake are the special effects cameron is a whiz with effects just watch aliens terminator and true lies and they are used very well throughout the sweeps of the ships are awesome although digital domain who did the effects cannot animate human movement too well the humans seem to move to smoothly there s just something odd about them you can tell that they have been animated on a computer of course the ship sinking scenes are awesome with bodies flying all over the place and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film titanic then is a wonder of directing acting and cgi but not writing and story again like most of camerons films the editing is loose cameron edits himself and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts titanic then although not the godfather of movies it could of been is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius enjoyable scary and even sad titanic is a film cinema was invented for filling the screen with incredible images and assaulting the ears with awesome sound a superb film but sadly not perfect overall rating 
ladies and gentlemen s independence day is here it s title starship troopers and surprisingly it is more entertaining than id i realize that i gave last year s sci fi hit a star rating but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour after subsequent viewings i feel that independence day really wasn t as great as it seemed though i still give it a positive review starship troopers on the other hand has a mocking sense of humor knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem as a result starship troopers is a more exciting energetic and lively science fiction film in fact i probably could never get tired of watching this film starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars another kick ass space opera which reinvented the sci fi drama altogether while starship troopers is no star wars it comes quite close and the easiest assessment would be to call this film the star wars of the s am i being to generous to this film perhaps but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance effectively into the warring races in essence this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films and i may have to starship troopers is not quite an original film persay but director paul verhoeven gives the film a kick the aliens asses style id had this same style except it was forced most likely the cause of will smith having a major role this new star wars has a very simple basic plot mankind vs an alien species the alien species in question here is the bugs a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid type insects however the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes but during quiet moments we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization more than likely these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends and they should be i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought provoking film this is an event film but surprisingly above average it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci fi war film and actually root for the human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange join the army ads mixing a web based interface these summations of events are refreshingly original stating would you like to know more these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor and we know we should not take it seriously however we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle in a gory yet funny way after witnessing the slaughter the film jumps back one year to setup what we just saw we are introduced to johnny rico casper van dien and carmen ibanez denise richards rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms however carmen isn t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer has her eye on rico unfortunately rico isn t interested in dizzy this setup is rather cliched as is the result of the setup but it still is fun to watch carmen signs up to become a starship trooper and as a result rico signs up and as a result dizzy signs up everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy carmen gets the pilot position she wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris a psychic gets a position in the training program and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers the mobile infantry the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships in reality i found myself watching a space version of melrose place but with better special effects an hour into the film the war begins a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with the first hour may have been a funny sometimes unintentionally setup but we grew to care for the flat characters because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters their gorgeous looks won me over call me superficial if you must following the training sessions which had many dramas in themselves too many to mention here the troopers are sent to war the bugs live on the planet klendathu a planet which consists of dirt and rock and pretty much nothing else many dramas occur during the war until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense the troopers are ordered to locate the brain and capture it i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible because starship troopers is not about plot it s about special effects and gory violence director verhoeven most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct returns to his sci fi days which gave us good films like total recall verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa but despite all the violence the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood starship troopers is extremely violent with more gore than this year s event horizon the r rating is well deserved and hopefully parents will not allow their year old children to see it my guess is that verhoeven s target audience is the to male group the film has a testosterone level off the charts with chiseled men and beautiful women despite these superficial elements starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful while watching the film we never second guess the character s decisions because they seem perfectly clear thankfully no hero is punching aliens in the face which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with but they soon grow on you casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon to most guys he will come across as artificial fortunately van dien is the worst of the cast despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character her dizzy is extremely likeable denise richards also does a good job and her scenes are very well done jake busey gary busey s son gives a wonderfully funny performance and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film neil patrick harris remember he was doogie howser is a little wooden and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast however he does give a good performance michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm his performance rises above the rest perhaps it is because his character is the most developed but i think it is just ironside s presence on screen unfortunately no particular cast member gives a star making performance which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars director verhoeven is the main star of the film his direction is fast and unrelentless he never slows down his pace which makes for a wild ride writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein the writing is usually very funny and sometimes very corny the dialogue is smart but not too smart we aren t required to know everything but some plot holes are left unanswered thankfully we are not intended to notice and we really don t except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while amazingly with all the wars and romance going on the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues in fact these governmental changes seem fairly plausible and this adds another layer to the story the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage i haven t laughed this loud even in some comedies oh and the special effects are first rate starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci fi violence and gore and for some language and nudity believe me when i say this don t take young kids to see this film it is extremely violent in fact it is probably the most violent film out this year however if you are old enough over to see it starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain it s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros while also cheering for the bad guys and still it is my dream to see a sci fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind and take over the world now that would be entertaining 
if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child would you do it gattaca is a film which presents a future where society has answered yes to this question but then ponders if this was actually the right decision gattaca came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature the lovable dolly the sheep and with this in mind the film only becomes more frightening the way the realm of genetics is heading it may only take a couple decades until the future gattaca presents becomes true contrary to the misleading trailers gattaca is not a sci fi thriller in the way that there s lots of murder hitchcockian suspense and chase scenes this is a quiet sad film about intelligent theories in fact the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley the latter who s novel brave new world featured genetically engineered children it s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia which is exactly what gattaca presents and the main reason i dug it so much the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ethan hawke a man with high hopes but a chance of heart problems and a prospected life span of around years as a child he was put down because of the threats of genetics while his younger genetically perfect brother anton loren dean was promised whatever his heart desired vincent yearns to be an astronaut but when he gets a job at a giant space company it s as a janitor ernest borgnine plays his boss but one day he finds out that it s probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist or something german wings tony shalhoub who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in men in black a life less ordinary who s client is a genetically perfect man jerome morrow jude law who has unfortunately been crippled fortunately though there s no record of the accident and he s willing to give someone else his life since vincent looks a bit like him after a couple alterations some minor some really major he has donned the life of jerome and is doing his job there he meets a genetically imperfect woman irene uma thurman who s genetically perfect in real life anyway hee hee and the two begin a kind of relationship albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man s stats are however a murder of a high level worker at his office is killed and one of vincent jerome s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi wily inspector hugo alan arkin and none other than vincent s long lost brother anton who hasn t seen him since they were teenagers we know vincent jerome didn t do it but with his older picture being posted everywhere not only vincent jerome s in trouble but also the real jerome who s as much in it as he is however there isn t many big suspense set pieces which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in the film would lose it s message and descend into just being a sci fi thriller a la william gibson the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening there are no big distractions from the point of the film much to the dismay of commercial audiences what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created irene has no real spunk in her life and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man claiming that his accident was really no accident what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that and the ending is shocking as it s a definite work of dystopian propaganda but doesn t have the down ending of other works of this kind the production design of this film is probably the best i ve seen this year it s stunning very pleasing to the eye but still very cold since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery and the sequence of all the high level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam esque feel to it showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie like life the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy the acting from everyone is great with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway interesting pointless fact uma and ethan started dating after this film and currently she is pregnant with his child but the best performance belongs to jude law who steals every scene he s in and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i m not sure of gattaca warns us not to go any farther chiefly because we ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are and when i see a possible future featuring a fingered piano player well folks that just creeps me out 
bob the happy bastard s quickie review rush hour so what s the problem with hours clones these days they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had that was the problem that plagued these clones not to mention the actual sequel another hours a complete waste of film but at last someone has a different take on the matter and it s director brett rainer rush hour features jackie chan in his first u s action movie playing a chinese detective who s being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate s daughter of course the fbi is upset that he ll be interfering in their investigation and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth of course that s chris tucker what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity i m michael jackson you tito and chan delivers a few zingers of his own as well as some terrific fight scenes the story s pretty much your average fare but with a decent twist involving the main villain a highly clouded figure named jun tao at least it s entertaining and the concept is excellently realized a particular fight scene in a chinese office where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys is funny and energetic at the same time and the finale s a real treat as well chan delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a story drop rush hour is just the sort of film you ll get a kick out of on any night of the week just make sure you don t look for anything culturally different and you ll be fine drunken master ii this ain t 
you don t have to know poker to like rounders but it might help that a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new york s cardshark underground astoundingly doesn t limit its accessibility even for those who can t tell royal and straight flushes apart rounders success then is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp but you don t have to speak the language to understand the words a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show matt damon fresh off his good will hunting hot streak is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling but after losing all of his tuition money in a killer high stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb john malkovich deliciously hammy he shifts his focus to scholarly matters leaving his true area of expertise far far behind things change however when mike s old buddy worm edward norton re enters his life it seems worm just out of jail owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs and is counting on his friend s superlative skills to help him pay off the debt that rounders story quickly molds itself into a conventional predictable tale of redemption doesn t hinder its potency director john dahl infamous for his neo noirs red rock west and the last seduction gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been there done that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm damon and norton bring so much to their roles that they d be worth catching even if rounders ultimately folded but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight if only the other character interaction was as successful rounders might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year s best films current it girl gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike s girlfriend jo aware and weary of his seedy past but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective john turturro s aging mentor and famke janssen s tempting siren both interesting sketches are hampered by the same limited screen time and as a wizened judge the great martin landau makes memorable a role that s mostly a plot device he s on hand mostly to sort of save the day and provide a voice for rounders moral that moral by the way is our destiny chooses us and it s something of a surprise when rounders supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect mike does learn from his mistake but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be in the end rounders sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture the road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions the movie espouses no matter what they might be here low rent lowlifes like worm just aren t cut out for the cards screenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture that s often generalized by movies even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene inside every adventurous filmgoer there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting and that s the precise allure of rounders it ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partially realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites we ve seen before because the final destination is a satisfying one in the end rounders holds a winning hand 
capsule the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse the idea is something about ghosts and the internet the film has an amazing apocalyptic style to perhaps the most disturbing and disturbed filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa his films all seem to have one style bleak the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold little known in the us to date his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid his film cure with one of his niftiest ideas is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with cure is probably his classic last year he released seance a remake of seance on a wet afternoon that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non supernatural story pulse is kurosawa back on form taguchi a young computer expert is late with his delivery of some important software two co workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment taguchi acting very strangely lets his friends look for the missing software meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew like spot on the wall taguchi s computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide but they are not entirely dead their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost if they say yes they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing like a computer disk instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death but whatever it does convey is nightmarish kurosawa who directs his own screenplay ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange junichiro hayashi the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa s films creates a dark cold and gloomy tone images are obscured by semi lighting or are behind plastic curtain scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock but a deeper metaphysical dread of any horror filmmaker in the world kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a on the to scale and a on the to scale 
recently i read reviews of pleasantville one from entertainment weekly one from a newsgroup and two from different online resources each review compared this film to the truman show why the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television other than that the two movies are completely different from each other reviewers seem to love to pick one movie i e the truman show obsess over it and make it a guideline for other movies when pleasantville and edtv opened all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman the same goes for the thin red line as well when it opened in decemeber probably of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg s saving private ryan giving thin line no chance whatsoever critics loved private ryan so much that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards this is why i think pleasantville was underrated if the truman show had never been made pleasantville probably would have received better reviews done better at the box office and would be remembered after it s long been on the video store shelves sure it wasn t perfect and it wasn t very believeable but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history with the exception of don knotts as the annoying tv repairman the film is cast perfectly the ice storm s tobey maguire is david in real life he watches the old s sitcom pleasantville to escape from his feuding parents his twin sister jen reese witherspoon is a popular slut who steriotypically smokes and wears revealing clothes but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue those excessive s terms such as like whatever and cool make her sound like the total dimwit she s supposed to be the twins with a little help from a tv repairman casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo esque cast rather than a true acting one are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote their new parents played by william h macy and joan allen are perfect in every way their new names are bud and mary sue and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles the movie begins to take form it s just like watching a sitcom in itself you don t want it to end mary sue has sex with her date the school basketball champion when he tells all his friends about it they stop preforming perfectly at basketball and things start to take color soon we learn that these people don t know how to express true emotions and when they learn to do so they eventually turn into color this eventually sparks a racial war between the coloreds and the black whites entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has none of the depth poignance and brilliance of the truman show yes the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent but the racial setting intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom certainly classifies as deep considering it s what i least expected gary ross did not try to create an intelligent award masterpiece he just tries to convey moral messages within his work take for example big and dave his past films big be careful what you wish for dave good or bad lying is still lying did these movies win big awards no but they won the heart of millions pleasantville could have done that too if it wasn t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films pleasantville a ad am i almost lost my nose and i like it i like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown 
the muppet movie is the first and the best movie among the ever growing list of muppet movies the muppet movie tells the story of how our hero kermit the frog came to be a star a delightful movie for all ages the muppet movie is bursting with cameo appearances by countless hollywood stars of the s and today the muppet movie begins in a movie theater where all of the muppet stars are anxiously awaiting the first showing once everyone is settled down the movie inside of the movie begins it starts out with kermit in a swamp playing his banjo and singing this shot required jim henson to spend hours underwater kermit is discovered by bernie a big time hollywood agent who happens upon kermit by accident bernie believes that kermit holds much potential to become a big star in hollywood kermit ponders the idea of becoming a big movie star where he could make millions of people happy kermit decides to leave his swamp and make the trip out to hollywood along the way kermit befriends his now famous muppet companions beginning with fozzie bear who had been spending his days doing stand up comedy at the el sleezo cafe owned by james coburn the two decide to team up and continue on their way to hollywood but doc hopper charles durning the owner of a chain of french fried frog leg restaurants has a different idea he wants kermit to be his spokesman but kermit is humiliated at the idea and spends the movie avoiding him and his assistants the trip continues with kermit and fozzie meeting miss piggy rowlf gonzo the electric mayhem band and more muppets who all share the same wish to make it to hollywood oh and even more celebrities continue to appear kermit and miss piggy continue to get to know each other a little better including a rather funny scene at a restaurant with steve martin as the waiter eventually kermit and the group make it to hollywood that is after kermit is finally able to elude doc hopper and proclaim his freedom lord lew a big time hollywood producer portrayed by orson welles gives kermit his shot at stardom and gives him the go ahead to produce a movie the muppet movie is definitely a movie that is fun for all ages it is also a sure deal as one parents can watch and enjoy along with their kids 
one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids although black and white films are frequently viewed as suspect ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind and if you can find a colorful action film even if it is from six decades ago then there is a real possibility of a take home hit so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood a high spirited version of the walter scott story nominated for the academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold s melodramatic music ralph dawson s fast paced editing and carl jules weyl s lush sets the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley a k a robin hood flynn with his handsome figure and toothy smile charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household the littlest rhodes jeffrey age liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more i ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review simply stated the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre the swashbuckler robin with a smile from ear to ear fights off a hundred men without a scratch although the picture can be considered as little more than a s james bond the production values and the acting raise it above that level robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows in this movie however he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country robin with his courage and athletic skills serves as a role model for kids and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy eyed lady marian fitzswalter the story has heavy romantic overtones filmed in the typical richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players in scene after scene the picture charms the audience who wouldn t fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest even if the outcome is so clearly preordained and of course he doesn t just win he does so by splitting the other man s arrow watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments sherlock holmes as the villain sir guy of gisbourne for example just doesn t seem right even if basil rathbone did have a real life identity outside of his most famous role and then there are those wigs from the makeup department so bad they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy as was popular in the cinema of that era people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks bad guys are banished rather than killed and lovers go off hand in hand doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful cartoonish figures hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore so try to savor the old ones when you can the adventures of robin hood runs it is not rated but containing absolutely nothing offensive it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages jeffrey thinks the film is great and gives it he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures he hates the sight of blood in movies his favorite parts are the battles and the ending and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ian hunter 
to me nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence ever since the big success of the action thriller face off in the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr cage the perpetually awful assassination thriller snake eyes was one of s worst films mm was a disappointing lost cause but who better than scorsese to match cage s wit and intensity which he does in miraculous fashion with bringing out the dead cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day to day after five years of the stress inducing job frank basically just staggers onward relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care namely a young girl named rose who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york frank desperately wants to be fired but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need i ll fire you tomorrow he promises frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance the first is larry john goodman who always has food on the brain the second is marcus ving rhames a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation and finally tom tom sizemore is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank but they never figured into the actual plot each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank s character because bringing out the dead is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary patricia arquette the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack arquette who recently received the wounds of christ in stigmata performs well around real life husband cage it s unfortunate that after such intriguing character trials and tribulations the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled ineffective finale the movie belongs to the one two punch of cage and scorsese who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to bringing out the dead although it certainly lacks the grit and hard edge of something like goodfellas scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture the incredible camera work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with s kundun does bringing out the dead rival scorsese s finest work only occasionally some of the film feels surprisingly limp but there is enough energy in it s interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice those expecting a grisly risqu product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight arrow approach but it s still a solid admirable effort bringing out the dead was written by the acclaimed paul schrader who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as taxi driver and raging bull schrader s script is full of moments wonderful sharply defined moments that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay the exceptional aspects of the film are it s astounding technical credits and the amazing cast goodman and sizemore are both electric well mainly sizemore but it s the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look watch the actor s deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member and you ll understand why he won a golden globe bringing out the dead is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it s certain flaws scorsese and cage for that matter have done better but their intentions are certainly admirable 
usually when a blockbuster comes out it s loaded with effects stars bad scripts and plenty of action mystery men may contain an all star cast and efects but the clever script and characters are what really works which is rare to see this year the film is based upon the comic book series the flaming carrot by bob burden in which wanna be super heroes try and fight crime only to be out done by the real hero of champion city captain amazing greg kinnear things go a little haywire when the sinister casanova frankenstein geoffrey rush is released into the city where he captures captain amazing and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city well the trio decide to take matters in their own hands by saving the city but first they need some assitance this is where the film takes a turn for the better in the beggining there were only wanna be heroes blue raja hank azaria mr furious ben stiller and the shoveller william h macy sure they were enterataining but their acts grew old fast that is until they aquire invisible boy kel mitchell and the bowler janeane garafalo and mr splein paul reubens of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess thankfully the original heroes become amusing with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen the whole premise is rather ridiculous but packs a few punches to keep interest for one the film is considerably clever it literally pokes fun at super hero films like batman and robin superman etc in fact many scenes are similar to batman and robin including the opening sequence only altered in a humorous and superior way a part of the cleverness comes from the cast sometimes a film with such talent is overblown but the acting is what keeps it alive here while azaria and macy were enteratining characters really stood out one was paul reuben no matter how disgusting or revolting mr splein may be you still can t help but laugh it so incredibly moronic it s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions janeane garafalo also was an interesting character she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem due to her enthusiasm that kept the film flowing men is worth seeing alone for those troubled heroes on the downside a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off kel mitchell and geoffrey rush were both utterly useless their parts were so limited they d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than minutes ben stiller too was wasted mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue none of these characters get a rise out of anybody but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film as far as the budget goes it was wisely spent on the cast not the effects while the set designs and action all look nice i m glad there was a seperate aspect that the film focused on and for that i applaud slow at times and rather pointless mystery men still delivers it forgets about money making because it s not likely to make a bundle like it s proceeders and that s what works stupid maybe but for once i m not disappointed no one expected an intelligent film but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year 
is it just me or have disney films gradually lost their appeal i was almost stunned by the quality of who framed roger rabbit a fun unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together the little mermaid harkened back to and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animations from the first half of the century however the endless stream of the little mermaid wanna be s is getting to me you know the spiel a lame plot recycled from some well known story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson the comedic sidekick sidekicks the seemingly unattainable love interest a few catchy songs a few in jokes for adults and the occasional out of place warner brothers coyote fall off the cliff type joke it s a formula and like any formula it gets tiresome that s why i m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli a japanese cartoon studio from what i ve seen of their movies kiki s delivery service and the already english dubbed and american distributed my neighbor totoro foreign audiences are in for a treat these movies particularly kiki s delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining kiki s delivery service starts with an unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecasts of clear skies decides it is time for her to leave home this is unusual because kiki isn t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch her mother is also a witch and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kiki s mother acts as a village doctor and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom kiki must choose a city to move to and what she chooses is the co star of the movie a german seaport town far removed from the country life she has been used to initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding she s discouraged and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch on the verge of leaving for a new town she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier a one persons delivery service this is where the movie becomes shockingly good kiki s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn t seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light they re three dimensional impossible to quickly evaluate possessing of faults and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl however each one has something about them some interest or trait that makes them interesting and unique the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely looks impressive capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the s this beauty is beauty with depth for every detail left in dozens are only hinted at i could probably go on all day but i won t suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie some of my favorites are kiki s relationship with the baker s husband although he s quiet never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie and he initially scares her his kindness wins her friendship in the garage of a deliveree s house can be found a vintage model t two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master servant to friend friend such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self worth kiki initially seems to derive much of her self worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty this causes kiki to lose faith in herself however kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don t even want to hint at it the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and ironically the most disney esque moment i ve ever seen if you don t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions there is no violence however cartoonish no song and dance number and kiki s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes however i would be surprised if disney doesn t give jiji more jokes or at least the voice of some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not self contradicted a habit disney movies have gotten into beauty and the beast s beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty was derived from a person s inside and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing kiki on the other hand learns to separate her wardrobe from her self image and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for kiki s delivery service not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be but with a greater attention to realism and detail it fits the movie to a t this is particularly true with scenes of kiki s flights the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i ve ever seen i m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states disney tentatively plans a theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that i d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release although the wait is unfortunate it s good to know that it s being released at all for kiki s delivery service is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release watch this movie along with man bites dog and perhaps something by woody allen this is the best movie i ve ever seen 
the idea at the center of the devil s advocate which is thus far one of the three or four best films of is that no matter what decision is made evil will triumph god is a trickster satan is a humanist the last humanist he appears in many guises and seduces many men and women in his own words vanity by far my favorite sin al pacino plays this role with relish and gets to chew some delectable lines lemme givya a piece o inside wisdom on god i have a million names as john milton the devil the main idea that he can appear as anyone in any form in this case a buisness man harkens mainly back to terry gilliam s the time bandits but the film is something else something original part of what makes it so very good is that it never takes itself too seriously it dabbles with morality vanity death and child abuse but doesn t try to become any profound study of power this is a marvelous confection cocky funny thought provoking it is also entertaining there is no way you could possibly predict the ending it pulls back upon itself drawing purely out of the mind s eye the final shot is more creative more daring more challenging then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen s fargo the central themes are fascinating sometimes reminiscent of james the turn of the screw and oates accursed inhabitants of the house of bly and the product that is built around it really wows its nice to know that things like this are still being made 
i was anxious to see this for a long time a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell and he wanted to prove that she s as hot as he thinks he is he proved it for me all right but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that scream treads on familar ground horror movie with as star neve campbell puts it some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can t act who s always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door it s very familar your typical horror film so why you may ask after watching it does it seem so new and original because it treats itself as if it hasn t been done before and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old familar tired stuff this raises another question how does it do this simple the characters they re not your typical stupid horror film victims who don t know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette they are horror fans they know how stuff happens in a horror movie they know what to do and what not to do and that makes it scary and even funny at certain times you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker drew barrymore is making popcorn getting ready to watch a video and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that if she gets it wrong will get her and her boyfriend killed she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions she just can t answer his final question what door am i at and that gets her killed that scene works because in a normal horror film half the things that happen in that scene would never happen the plot is typical horror stuff sidney prescott an impressive neve campbell an attractive young high school student who s mother was killed a year ago tommorrow is being stalked by a killer who s previously murdered one of her classmates casey naturally and everybody in this small california town is a suspect including sidney s boyfriend billy loomis but as i said before these people know how horror movies work and that s what makes it so appealing that and the references to horror movies like when casey says the first nightmare on elm street was scary but the rest sucked which is obviously director wes craven who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others and when tatum sidney s friend mentions the director wes carpenter which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven but also director john carpenter the cast is well chosen neve campbell pulls off a good heroine and unlike most horror film heroines she can act drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film and david arquette is impressive also good and funny in his role is henry winkler the fonz as the school principal i took half a point off for the unnecessary albeit limited appearance by friends courteney cox as reporter gail edwards sidney s rival because she covered her mother s disappearance i hate that show i hate those actors they re untalented overexposed and overpaid imho and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough but i suppose he isn t 
just how inseparable is the team of sgt martin riggs mel gibson and sgt roger murtaugh danny glover let s just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction his partner actually does it the familiar lethal weapon family is back including rene russo who is now the expectant mother of riggs child and joe pesci as the soprana like foul mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye new to the team is chris rock also a fast talking up and coming detective trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go and in this film that is no exception even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship we here some ominous music which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen gunfire ensues and when it s all over the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord although they don t know what they re looking for their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action and there s plenty of action here for two movies led by fighting sensation jet li whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to li is ruthless in his approach will kill anyone just to make a point and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives there are terrific car chases explosions and gunshot galore it s a summer action recipe followed to the letter and the result is nothing less than pure unadulterated summer fun but even too many explosions can get boring to counter that we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li luckily he d rather fight hand to hand instead of firing off guns meanwhile when the detectives aren t reloading their guns or running from fireballs they re engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets everybody gets in on the shtick russo screams during her delivery the crime lord has a few funny bits when he s being interrogated while being given laughing gas and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano score one for the old guard 
towards the middle of the sweet hereafter a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend careens through the steel guard rail and disappears out of sight then in long shot we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow covered field it pauses for a moment before the field cracks under the bus weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment a single smooth second of time compare that scene if you will to the last eighty minutes of titanic when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise and you ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films the scene in the sweet hereafter epitomizes all that s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan s film it s not sensational we don t see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming terrified children being bloodied and battered about the bus doesn t explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake it s a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance using a non linear approach to his narrative egoyan shifts back and forward in time connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy fourteen children died in the accident leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit stephens who doesn t believe in accidents functions as a concerned involved observer scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath while stephens initial drive may be financial one third of the total settlement if he wins his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss his self destructive drug addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics halfway houses and detox units for years egoyan s attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry mychael danna who composed the shimmering music for the ice storm contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles equally impressive is paul sarossy s cinematography capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room the sweet hereafter while undeniably grim urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go it s a film of generous subtlety and emotion 
i can hear the question already what on earth do these two movies have in common to most people not a lot except that both are by renowned directors as i saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers but oh how differently the packages affect their films while everyone s production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campion s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is i left everyone says i love you not remembering a lot about who loved whom but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face i left the portrait of a lady not remembering a lot about who loved whom and i could have cared less everyone features nothing allen hasn t done before storywise woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman roberts and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong again similar situations happen to his family and friends some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his early funny films the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of take the money and run his directorial debut however nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one of a kind display of sheer good spirits in fact in this movie the feeling itself is what s most important yes the movie would have been better among his very best i think if it had a meatier story but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling and what better way to express feeling than through music love is often best expressed in a song and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart some are a tad too goofy such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor but i admired allen for even putting them in there it also helps that as usual allen has a top flight cast working with him their singing voices range from quite good goldie hawn to not quite good allen to literally unlistenable barrymore whose real voice was dubbed by a professional but while their vocal abilities differ all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen and making it rub off on the audience granted some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies but for those attuned to it this film should work wonders jane campion too has a top flight cast working for her in portrait of a lady too but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted virtually lifeless mess albeit a visually interesting one campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye filling images that linger in the mind unfortunately what didn t linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people even worse i don t find myself feeling bad that i ve forgotten the problem i think lies not with the cast which seemed to be trying very hard for the material it was the script that couldn t convince me to care about anyone the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion but i found no reason to connect with any of them i understood that the story was about cold emotionally vacant characters but for me to care about them i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives jones script never simply gave me that opportunity in the end it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes unfortunately as she kept painting these dazzling pictures they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film in the end the movie s one strength ended up hurting it so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them why with both films my head cared about neither story but only everyone says i love you was able to make my heart sing 
star wars episode i the phantom menace review a review by jamey hughton stars starring liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman and jake lloyd director george lucas rated g with all the hype that star wars episode the phantom menace has been receiving it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago in a galaxy far far away yes this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity but that doesn t mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment the phantom menace features the most eye catching jaw dropping visual look in cinematic history the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest and the special effects are nothing short of the best and most plentiful to ever be caught on film the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses even if it has some disappointing aspects after we re treated to the famous prologue in the sky with john williams thundering score we meet qui gon jonn liam neeson and young obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor a jedi master and his trainee padawan they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo oh but enough about that the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker jake lloyd into the picture as you already know this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter this particular race is the most exciting energetic high octane action sequence that you ll ever see one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised and the phantom menace is no exception i loved sebulba the rat like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race and boss nass the leader of the gungans who are a neighbouring species to naboo one character who has been subject to criticism is jar jar binks a member of the gungan race jar jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief yes he is initially annoying but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless goofy antics there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses the final light saber battle between the jedi s and the horrific and terminally underused villain darth maul is spectacular to behold jabba the hutt yoda c po and r d have cameo appearances lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments episode s i and ii when they arrive you ll know where to find me 
up until about a year ago john travolta s career consisted of those look who s talking movies notice how they never called them look who s talented and the bomb shout which was bad enough to make most people scream but somewhere along the line travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in would experience fame and fortune once again while barry robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a straight to the cutout bin album aptly named size isn t everything and of course they learned that sales are everything but now travolta s back on the hollywood scene once again and i think we all know why four words contract with the devil and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich s contract with america no satan is much more humane anyway yes travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld how do i know i own the document in question amazing what you can buy at those collector s shops for a few hundred dollars isn t it get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction with travolta as crime minion chili palmer he goes to collect some of the mafia s money from a b grade director gene hackman and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game sure a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood but i guess that s beside the point palmer is determined to get hackman s next project made so he sets out to convince big star martin weir danny devito to star in the movie bringing along down and out horror actress karen flores rene russo who has already had affairs with hackman and devito it doesn t take a las vegas odds maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well after the customary sexual tension and denial which has been used in every comedy from who s the boss to speechless it works in this case unlike who s the boss although it s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman s other films and want in on this one too along with travolta s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction despite the obvious similarities this movie doesn t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i ve seen this year yes even better than halloween vi get shorty is my kind of movie one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence i m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on are you getting this shorty 
a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation state against another a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocents anywhere at anytime that gives the figure his label edward zwick s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states you d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad and the u s responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack however unlike the real life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden s camp and manufacturing facility the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal in retaliation the terrorists bring the fight to the new world unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent in charge anthony hubbard denzel washington who works out of the bureau s new york office at one federal plaza while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple he encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying to uncover information generally the fbi is charged with problems inside the u s while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but as the two form a tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government the original tagline for patriot games was there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil however true it was pulled before the movie s release because it sounded too much like a dare revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america admittedly the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive who s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two thirds but the basic premise is still valid i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action thriller fare of good guy g men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab american population and that in an effort to find the terrorists the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself in fact about halfway through the film when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberties of all americans are put at risk although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups throughout the film maintains a conflict between hubbard who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides it actually gets rather heady at times but it s a credit to screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they don t underestimate the intelligence of the audience i don t know if it s his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great this combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid level authority figure makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i ve seen recently and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable it s somewhat unfortunate that her character s fortitude is broken at a certain point but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough guy role always standing straight and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face however the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film s development notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad a lebanese immigrant the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society difficult to say the least shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick s favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems to be his favorite composer i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian themed music and horner s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish sounding at most revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole it s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we ve been getting throughout the year missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes for example it s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick unfortunately there s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye catching in the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than feet from friendly troops verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point the film also gets a little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different races to get along a noble gesture the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously these flaws are glaring but they don t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class 
i know that funnest isn t a word fun is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective but that s the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie i ve ever seen so to hell with webster s chicken run is one of the funnest movies i ve seen in a while i can t remember the last time i ve seen anything funner the chickens at tweedy s farm are up to something living in a concentration camp like atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box one night a brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farm s egg selling plan for a pie selling plan she orders a huge pie making machine cackling chickens go in pies come out what sort of pies chicken pies of course co director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and a close shave the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and a close shave owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming with co director peter lord park has created a similar creature in chicken run the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for a quick reference to the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement thing is the film doesn t feel like it s been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners of war movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all it s worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is but they re chickens so it s funny to us another thing that helps chicken run and most of park s films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing there are references to the great escape obviously and stalag the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom there s even a nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in a little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson s nationality and film history the braveheart reference is a hoot if you catch it when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution consider this since july of last year i ve seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they re parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run doesn t lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene if you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it s understood and as a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment of this movie doesn t require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it s hard not to fall in love with every one of them ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung ho veneer the characters inevitable romance doesn t feel contrived but sweet poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn t any help jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs a hen that runs away with most of the best one liners all while perpetually crocheting a sweater and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence they even come up with an inspired riff on something that s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as a delightful surprise the film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation is first rate remember that this was all done the old fashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail as in such top notch family fare as a bug s life or toy story chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but a active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details anyway the movie s just a boatload of fun funnest damn movie i ve seen all year 
originally entitled dancing about architecture i e talking about love is like dancing about architecture but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box office dud dancing at lughnasa this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names playing interesting and well written characters within a vignettes styled plot arrangement a la robert altman plot follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love finding themselves regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are and who they want and appreciating the fine emotional art of love critique charmingly effective romantic drama this film offers insight into various types of relationships presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties how do people fall in love why do people fall out of love how do people fall back into love once they ve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club all of these questions and more are touched upon in this film within several types of variant relationships meet a hip young couple going through their first date a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships a married woman finding herself while cheating on her husband a husband letting go of his inhibitions an older couple dealing with a past love of the man a secret recently uncovered a son dying from aids joined by his mother at the hospital there are many nuances to this picture and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate but more importantly there is diversity diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels some related to the younger couples issues others with the married there s a little bit of everything for everyone in here and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year i would relate myself to yet another predicament just like love itself this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels the actors in this film are all also very very good sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve as is gena rowlands as the aging wife with trepidations jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance while philippe is as pretty boy as ever anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re ignite her love life opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk show host jon stewart even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached was the part surrounding jay mohr the man dying from aids and his mother ellen burstyn the actors were fine but somehow the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me but i guess that s just hollywood this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors and happiness in concept and style but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care as opposed to this film which offers rich and believable characters living real lives and talking about real issues in today s relationships all in all this movie offers many interesting characters talking and living genuine and engaging love lives wonderful performances by its solid cast too sweet of an ending but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless little known facts about this film and its stars according to a story in the london sunday mirror sean connery asked for only for his role in this movie as compared to his usual fee of million because he liked the script so much on top of that he convinced his co stars including gena rowlands gillian anderson ellen burstyn et al to do the same this is director writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of adult films before this he had written and produced many children s movies gillian anderson stands angelina jolie s full name is angelina jolie voight she is actor jon voight s daughter she has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute she divorced actor jonny lee miller of trainspotting fame in they were married in actor ryan phillippe s full name is matthew ryan phillippe he stands and spent his childhood in new castle delaware his acting career started on tv s one life to live he portrayed daytime television s first gay teenager jon stewart s full name is jonathan stewart leibowitz this film was originally entitled if they only knew and dancing about architecture watch for movie posters from swingers chasing amy and the texas chainsaw massacre at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date 
a couple of months ago when i first downloaded the face off trailer from the net my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold yawn followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss poor trailer then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u s unique excellent must see well i thought still skeptical i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here here of course was still three months away i ll admit when i trotted off to see this film the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow i d heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled but his films were definitely not on my must see list that let me tell you has changed completely i knew this fact only five minutes into the film after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick seriously i ve never been a big john travolta fan but he like cage perfectly suited his role in the movie sorry make that roles in the movie even travolta s great performance however paled in comparison to cage s character portrayals my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler s hideout half drugged out of his mind he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son s death from castor s perspective doesn t it just break your heart he mutters coldly now don t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie it s not that s what really makes this movie unique it s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters not a common mix at all suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though that s the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around rounds at each other and never hit several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press rewind and watch it over again the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double sided mirror is just plain brilliant whilst cage s and travolta s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies the lesser characters are just as intriguing joan allen who usually sticks to the straight drama movies plays her part perfectly as archer s long suffering wife i like the fact that her character didn t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie it would have wrecked her potrayal gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy s mistreated girlfriend make that one of castor troy s mistreated girlfriends other movies would have used her character as just window dressing a sex object but instead her character is very strong and independent dominique swain who plays archer s daughter also does a nice job though her character is not as explored as much as allen s or gershon s faults well there were some i have to say first the movie s ending whilst being very good overall was a bit too drawn out for it s own good after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can t help but think geez are you guys nuclear powered or what there were certain bits that weren t handled properly like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform prison more explanation here would have been nice overall this movie was not perfect but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made i certainly hope so 
 when you get out of jail you can kill him starring ashley judd tommy lee jones bruce greenwood rated r double jeopardy is a lurid prepostrous thriller that s also one of the year s most enjoyable it s an uncompromisingly brutal cheerfully anarchic hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it there is not a moment here when the events on screen don t have a direct bearing on the plot once the film gets going it never stops it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that s probably a correct assessment of the plot but the film itself has little in common with the andrew davis harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones not even bothering with character introduction director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get go and never finds the brake we meet rather hastily libby and nick parsons ashley judd and bruce greenwood respectively a seemingly happy married couple with a son matty age they go out on a sailboat one night and after a period of some rockin sex they go to sleep libby hears a strange noise wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood she follows a red trail to the upper deck where she finds a knife and out of astonishment picks it up at that convenient moment the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested her lawyer a friend puts up a defense in court but though we know she is innocent the evidence against her is too compelling her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison once in prison she makes a phone call to her friend her friend gives her son the phone nick walks in the room little matty screams daddy the phone goes dead libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn t even dead she gets some advice from a prisoner former lawyer who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband they can t convict her of the same crime again meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can t touch her after a weirdly short amount of time she gets out of parole she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees under the command of parole officer travis lehman tommy lee jones she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son s adopter double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime same time same place same circumstances it s not like it matters this is a rollickingly good thriller intense exciting fast and furious it s silly alright but this is the kind of film you just don t question in some films plausibility is everything double jeopardy however is not concerned with making sense its sole purpose is to entertain and it does judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role this is her breakout box office performance and she is terrific she brings some emotion to what could have been a one dimensional role giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive but the movie makes good use of his stone faced wit thankfully too double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film s story this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system it s great to see a movie that doesn t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure double jeopardy is really good but it isn t the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards it s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off otherwise your brain will be busy ruining your experience this is a thriller that isn t concerned with being smart or plausible instead it diverts all attention to the action which this year is second to none 
an indian runner was more than a courier he became the message he was carrying what danger is a bear to a message i used to think sean penn was an immature arrogant photographer punching madonna marrying loudmouth but all that has changed now the guy has grown up and that s not all it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director if this film is any indication one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper but no this film is about a real struggle and the victories and defeats are not simple penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters without unnecessary rush or flash the focus of the story is two brothers david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer viggo mortensen is the wild brother whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can t name much less resolve the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared the film is unobtrusive simple direct plain and sincere it isn t exactly perfect but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems this is a good film without big budget sets or big name stars pushed into your face in fact i m reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing there were perhaps others at the showing i saw i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified though there are a few free form sections which also work very well the obligatory s music seemed a little cliche but what are you going to do this movie does take place in the s after all in my opinion it is worth full price admission 
i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x files first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable you have to reach for a larger audience therefore the movie is quite user friendly altough non fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no i am not a fan of the x files i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium however since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the x files is what a summer should be exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank from start to finish this movie does not let go of you when i compare it with last summer s movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the x files is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the x files is a monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total no the x files is definately a mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much no this is mulder s time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you let s just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who cares if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies don t the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take a breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the x files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves a purpose who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attacks so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the x files is what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effects it s good some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non fans will have a good time it does not provide answers to the show s many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah i never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half a star well i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop it s pretty obvious the film s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving 
cinematically speaking gordon parks original shaft is not a great film a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman s black private dick that s a sex machine to all the chicks to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking yet nearly years after its original release and long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decade the shaft remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness the reason for this is the same one that explains the film s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african american audience the title character of john shaft while the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broad based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass this fact also explains why john singleton s y g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is much like the film that started the franchise this shaft s plot doesn t score points in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers contrary to what has been reported over the past few months this shaft is not a remake of the original film but more of a sequel spinoff the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels s shaft s big score and s shaft in africa richard roundtree once again plays john shaft who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city however the focus of the film lies on his same named nephew samuel l jackson who as the film begins is a cop whose take no crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors when a privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of a brutal racially motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p i but that s easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez jeffrey wright a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime peoples or rather wright is also the big obstacle in jackson s way toward commanding this film peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stages however he isn t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish and peoples eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming it s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but that s exactly what wright does and makes it seem effortless then again with such a talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jackson s impressive star turn doesn t quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co stars bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in american psycho so it only follows that his performance as a similar less exaggerated character would be spot on collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened conflicted diane busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft s sidekick rasaan registering not as strongly but through no fault of their own are vanessa williams as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez and a dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also has little to do in a sense some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside his shaft doesn t even have one sex scene that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he s not really an action director this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases they move well as does the film as a whole and are reasonably exciting it s just that there s nothing terribly inventive about them these set pieces are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but they re unsurprising and conventional but if there s anything that a shaft movie does well it s make the familiar look cool and this shaft keeps that tradition alive from the slick title sequence scored of course to isaac hayes ever infectious oscar winning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film on the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced it feels necessary style doesn t exactly make for a great film but when it comes to shaft that s of little consequence what matters above all else is having a good time and the latest shaft should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha shut your mouth 
if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it s their predictable endings the devil s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending when everything that should happen does unfortunately for the devil s advocate this ending nearly collapses in on itself and ruins the entire film nevertheless the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film i don t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan well it does contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements and seemingly more interesting ones at that the devil s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session kevin lomax keanu reeves is the defense attorney working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl he ends up with a not guilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury he accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he flies to new york with his wife after proving his worth for selecting juries and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer he graciously accepts where he is treated almost as a god he is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and a hefty paycheck his life seems to be on the rise and of course his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline he is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice especially if it is not wanted meanwhile kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen craig t nelson who apparently murdered three people he spends hours upon hours with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself after a while things turn completely upside down as kevin s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends a fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevin s real father is it all just a big nightmare or is john milton really satan playing tricks with kevin s life the devil s advocate plays out fairly straight forward but for some odd reason the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don t expect is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed if so the devil s advocate messes up completely and ironically i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early i went into the devil s advocate expecting a shocking horror film and that is exactly what i got i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what i got but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did i mention that i didn t like the ending the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending they pull the rug out from under you films like se en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way the devil s advocate on the other hand ends unpredictably not from us knowing a lot but knowing nothing at all if that is confusing i recommend watching the film and then reading that again as for the film overall i enjoyed the entire first two hours being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study the film runs like a well built clock slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that and then you settle in for a nice resolution which does not occur it was at this point that i felt cheated taking us on a terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around as he is the centerpiece of the film everything occurs from his perspective he is our representation on screen sort of but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game i don t want to spoil the ending so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil s advocate is the extreme amount of everything it earned its r rating for a reason there is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity this film really isn t subtle about anything showing us everything it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc rating as it is quite harsh however the movie does have its merits and nudity and sex are among those i don t condone sex and nudity in films but if its there i might as well enjoy it the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary ann s problems are incredibly intense and i found myself wanting to witness her decline this may sound uncaring but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her she is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into a world where she is not wanted something the devil s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity especially for a film of this nature the story actually has something to say about humanity in one of the last scenes john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children he is satan of course he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity then god sets up rules which contradict human nature this semi religious bashing is more humorous than frightening what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it was funny but patially realizing it was true these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil s advocate giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing but i m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on when a film has something to say about our society it deserves to be watched the cast of the devil s advocate is one of the highlights as we see memorable faces and they put spins on those memorable faces we don t expect heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she does a great job probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves he has proven himself an uneven actor successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic but he tops himself with this performance i have never seen him more believable to date al pacino is of course the scene stealer his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witches of eastwick and max von sydow needful things he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term jeffrey jones mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller s day off also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin s past connie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several times one familiar face with a twist was coach star craig t nelson who gives a very good performance the devil s advocate is rated r for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore at minutes this film moves along fairly quickly for the first two hours i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters the technical quality is also remarkable with great special effects and a good musical score director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for a long time but just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream personally i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early 
 warning to those who have not seen seven this review contains some spoiler information seven is a powerful fully realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled while this film is not for the squeamish there is no denying that seven demands attention for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance for starters classifying seven as a thriller would not be an altogether complete classification of this film while i was genuinely thrilled throughout i would rather call seven an intense drama because that is what it delivers meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as simple as a corpse and visually fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all too realistic and graphic terms courtesy of rob bottin s always grisly special effects throw in the appropriate but not to be underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene these scenes alone are quite impressive as fascinating as they are harrowing yet seven is more than just a technical accomplishment in addition to style fincher supplies substance seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society detective william somerset morgan freeman is a man who has nearly given up on the world its easy to see why the world doesn t make sense somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct after knocked down and robbed of his wallet the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and picking up the pieces he will be able to catch the killer somersets new partner david mills brad pitt has not given up on the world perhaps because he is still young and perhaps by having this optimism he s naive in this films portrayal of the world he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope however david s wife gwyneth paltrow has so much fear of her urban surroundings she isn t even sure if she wants to tell her husband about her recent pregnancy let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world fincher gives us support for why they feel the way they do but if there s one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey it has to be the killer john doe kevin spacey seven s payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a psycho with no motives behind his slayings this is exactly the mistake mills makes in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes were allowed to see that doe is in his mind merely a product of society he s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down in his mind he didn t kill innocent people and perhaps they were not completely innocent but then again who is hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent really seven doesn t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed up john doe is seven makes larger statements about how screwed up society is hinting that society s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does besides the stylistic and larger issue arguments for seeing this film i recommend seven because it is after all also a very slick and well made thriller it features exciting plot developments commanding performances lots of suspense and a conclusion that is chilling riveting and quite unfair but then again its a cruel world 
 psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget third rate rip off but no this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria perhaps italian horror director dario argento s most consistently successful film what impresses most in re watching this surrealistic supernatural thriller is that argento s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near fully coherent narrative screenplays have always been his achilles heel confusing subplots gaping holes totally illogical incidents and reactions no question argento has always been a better director than a writer fortunately he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called suspiria de profundis the film s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance arriving at the school late at night in driving rain she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state what happens next and i don t make the comparison lightly is a murder sequence that for intensity shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock s infamous shower scene in psycho it s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock but with its baroque sets graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin this stunning sequence remains very much argento s own though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria s opening minutes the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour old matriarch from hell roles she does so well several more violent murders ensue including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is well i wouldn t want to spoil things now would i and the film s climax staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms has a gothic ghoulishness that s most impressive the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming and not just for the violence deep red and phenomena for example have been appallingly hacked about fortunately the cuts to suspiria about minutes in this version have not adversely affected the film the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done too excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region and the soundtrack it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else as it stands the use of goblin s music in suspiria is outstanding apparently argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer s overall experience even better see suspiria in a cinema where you ll get the added bonus of widescreen and the colours deep reds eerie blues a superb use of shadow and contrast the cinematography of luciano tovoli whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female is uniformly superb a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento s more surreal excursions the other most notable example being inferno on which bassan also worked suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors and it is fully deserving of its cult status the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated that s always been one of argento s shortcomings but overall this is a fascinating compelling example of italian horror

i don t know what movie the critics saw but it wasn t this one the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring in my personal opinion they couldn t be more wrong if you were expecting airplane like laughs and agatha christie intense mystery then yes this movie would be a disappointment however if you re just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time this is one to see honest it is this story is about a th network wbn taking to america s airwaves in penny henderson mary stuart masterson the station owner s secretary must deal with her overbearing boss an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment s notice partly due to the fact that they haven t been paid in weeks among the mayhem she must also deal with her soon to be ex husband roger brian benben who desperately wants her back unfortunately her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation while trying to woo penny back roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny i m trying to be unbiased so i won t tell you how amazing she looked although brian benben gets most of the screen time along with the two leads are several recognizable faces including corbin bernsen l a law michael mckean laverne shirley and bobcat goldthwait the special effects are amazing and fooled me which some may argue isn t very difficult to do in many scenes although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie overall i gave it or an depending on what system you use some comments collected from friends

review a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in th century flanders living with his grandfather jehan jack warden in poverty nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times they are renting a spare one room cottage and the greedy malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them out of the house if they don t pay the rent nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen in either a movie or in real life his hero is peter paul rubens the great flemish painter of the th century not that these are the only things that make nello s life happy however he has a dog of flanders whom he names patrasche who is a heroic rin tin tin of the th century whom he rescues from his cruel unkind master in addition he even has a best friend and future sweetheart in the lovely wealthy aloise whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with lower class nello he thinks he s not good enough for her and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying but then he was a poor guy himself before he married as mentioned later on in the film one day nello encounters a mysterious yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande played wonderfully by jon voight who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist and every christmas there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year the winner getting a lot of money eager to save his home and his aging dying grandfather nello willingly decides to become an artist asking aloise to pose for him one night the two travel to a circus where they have their fortune told one of the film s most delightful scenes that great happiness is destined for them she gives the kids a ring whom nello places on aloise s hand afterwards the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers unfortunately things are not all la dee dah in this tale aloise s father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again bad enough that they can t see each other although we know nello and aloise don t we but that s only the start of nello s troubles aloise s farm is burned down and nello is wrongfully accused by the landord of his cottage for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise this decreases nello s reputation around the town save aloise and her parents and a kindly miller william who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies and he has to pay for his funeral but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home for not paying his rental permanetly this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold freezing wind worst of all the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time the portrait of the princess fails to win the prize at the festival now nello and patrasche are really depressed and close to freezing to death will nello be able to find any happiness in his life will patrasche save the day will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise a dog of flanders is a delightful heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages even older ones who consider themselves too sophisticated for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown ups too there have been other movies of this ilk boy and dog and while this one falls into that category it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself move over or rather roll over old yeller this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight the cinematography courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful and really adds to the powerful drama of the film it also gives a feel of being in flanders the whole film was respectably shot in flanders the music from richard friedman is also remarkable an evocative poignant score that recaptures music from the th century the opening song over the credits is very beautiful i hope the soundtrack is available and there s a brief excerpt of cheer up charlie from willy wonka and the chocolate factory sung by aloise to nello in another delightful scene the cast is first rate jesse james and jeremy james kissner who play nello are some of the most endearing adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life so are the girls who play aloise madyline sweeten as the younger and farren monet as the older not that they are the only good stars however jack warden is ideal as jehan eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming touching ones also bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william he s another one of my favorite characters in the film but jon voight as i mentioned before is the perfect choice for michel he brings a mysterious yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he can win the contest but what makes this film fun to watch is how well defined the characters are and the pace of the story best of all it has a happy ending though i will not give it away sorry is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters for the first time since the beginning of there comes a film which doesn t rely on popular formula stuff such as big budget special effects commercial rock soundtracks or any of that stuff this one relies on telling a fully character oriented story with just the right amount of heart humor and drama that to me is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful eleanor o sullivan of the home news tribune noticed this and was kind and generous enough to welcome it for want of a better word a glow surrounds a dog of flanders its heart is in the right place and it engages you you can guess where the film is going because this is well traveled territory but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner an often told story is well worth a revisit in addition there were a couple of other enthusiasts such as chicago sun times and the washington post you should read their reviews they re really positive other critics however were not so kind stephen holden of the new york times had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing he found the film to be a sea of sugary bromides and condemned mr voight s character as hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda in addition entertainment weekly slam dunked the film condemning it as the worst family film of the year there have been so many other bad reviews like this too my suggestion disregard the critics they just have a big problem with touching family films and one should never pay attention to them this dog of flanders may only be a little family movie it probably won t be a big hit in the style of titanic but then again no other film has been since then but that is not a bad thing in and of itself this is a story that is sure to warm your heart and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders it is also one of the better family films around this year none of the other films i have seen this year though they were good have been so low key and touching if you re looking for family style entertainment look no further than this charming boy and dog yarn go see it while you still can for as i mentioned it might not be a big bow wow at the box office for a long time see it while you can there is really no need to compare a multi million dollar blockbuster such as star wars episode i the phantom menace or tarzan or even the iron giant with a tender sweet little family movie 
after hearing reviews for woody allen s upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring to just so so my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time woody allen s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand in hand manhattan really is one of the best looking films i ve ever seen beautiful black and white photography of the city s best areas etc a fan can t help but feel visibly moved the film opens up with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with an airplane beethoven s th blasts on the soundtrack the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment and it s all rather lovely to look at and then we cut to a film crew shooting this as the film s hilariously banal key moment in the film where the lead actress in the film melanie griffith looking as buxom and beautiful as ever has to realize something s wrong with her life or whatever it s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film with the great opening shots or without and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works though for the record last year s deconstructing harry came awfully close what the hell has happened to him the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas bullets over broadway though wonderful relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off mighty aphrodite is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story everyone says i love you was more of a great idea than a great film even deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in a way even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films if anything the reception of celebrity by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time it s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is it s him celebrity is yes a good film but it s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film instead of creating the great woody allen world he s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about and he s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections it s like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis woody becoming more insecure in his old age choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead much has been said about his performance dead on but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh s performance though featuring some of the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots o hand gestures is hardly a warts and all impersonation branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm which actually allows for his character s flaws to be more apparent woody s a flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because he s really funny and really witty and really intelligent branagh s allen is a bit more flat out bad but with the same charm so that yes we like him but we re still not sure if he s really a good person or not his character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hits on extra actress winona ryder then goes off to interview griffith who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her and she denies him sorta we then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script a bank robbery movie but with a deep personal crisis as such he has divorced his wife of several years allen regular judy davis and continues on a quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film after griffith comes his escapades with a model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad to see allen is using new jokes ha ha who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen a relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades with ryder whom he fancies most of all his story is juxtaposed with that of davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status while lee is fumbling about selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy i ve become the kind of woman i ve always hated and i m loving it without doing a thing the result is a film of highs and mediums the mediums are what take up most of the film with sitations and scenes which don t exactly work but you can t help but pat allen on the back for trying but other places are really great scenes the opening the sequence with theron which is so good that i wished it hadn t ended a banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll as ever and perhaps the best sequence a romp with hot as hell teen idol brandon darrow played by none other than leo dicaprio who is so un dicaprio esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film they d never look at him the same way he ignites the screen with intensity and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read and finds himself on a wild all day ride with him they go to atlantic city to watch a fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow gets it on with his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupies allen s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them i d almost recommend the film almost but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it s a mess despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself it s still a smart and insightful film though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities as it may seem to be if it were it d be extremely out of touch but about those who want to be celebrities and how they equate celebrity hood with happiness we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they re really happy they may appear to be on the surface but we do get close enough to lee and davis character lee is obsessed with the phenomenon while davis takes is at arm s length and never gets too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself besides it s witty and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen s that great woody allen feel it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject and yes as a part of woody allen s oeuvre it s merely a blip no annie hall but it s no shadows and fog either but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice 
it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst k tm he had never seen any episodes of the show and i have watched a scant few due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes for those of you not familiar with the premise dr clayton forrester beaulieu wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public to achieve this he in the words of the tv series theme which is missing in the movie bumped mike nelson nelson on the noggin and then shot him into space and is monitoring nelson s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions tom servo and crow t robot the format of the show consists of nelson servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched and breaks every minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love the ship on which our heroes are marooned only two things are different in the movie the absence of forrester s sidekick tv s frank and the slower pace of the jokes this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke for their big screen outing the producers have chosen this island earth a classic and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill unfortunately for that film but making it ideal mst k fodder acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which by today s standards are less than impressive nelson co make jokes about everything from japan s dominance in the world market to star trek to the state of disrepair of seattle s kingdome and most of them work unfortunately the segments set outside the satellite s movie theater seem out of place and aren t particularly funny but at least they re fairly short the big question about this movie though is why i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen there are no special effects to dazzle you no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat and no use of digital surround sound so it seems pointless to spend per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts nevertheless mst k tm provides more laugh out loud opportunities than any film you re going to see this year and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse given its uniqueness i hesitate to grade it against other films but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b movies it does well 
did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra terrestrial i used to think that about my th grade english teacher ms carey but after seeing this movie they may have confirmed my suspicions as the story goes at any time there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth the men in black mib are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens guardians of our beloved planet from nasty tempered aliens and secret service to the stars based in new york city where weird is the norm the mib organization gives human form to our space faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed but to enforce the laws of earth the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast they carry other worldly technology to erase people s short term memory when common folk see the mib in action and their best leads on cosmic things gone awry are the supermarket tabloids little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v evil going on in the depths of space one of the aliens as human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious it holds the key literally to universal peace a giant cockroach like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this key in the wrong alien hands flippers mandibles tentacles it can be used as a weapon therefore it must be recovered and returned to it s rightful owners otherwise to ensure universal safety earth will be destroyed along with the key now it s the mib who must prevent this catastrophe the mib agents on the case are k played by tommy lee jones he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes he is accompanied by a flippant rookie j played by will smith but despite this shoot em up protect earth from destruction premise this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie and this isn t an independence day knockoff rather this is a stylishly offbeat sci fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies that there are real aliens that live here and that the government does its darndest to cover them up but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe there must be some kind of earth hangs in the balance scenario yet this movie is very appealing the abundance of wierdness talking aliens pee wee atomizers a mortician who lives for her work and lots of yucky bugs and slime splattering galore is played straight like as if this were normal of course we are in nyc it gives it a deadpan feel which makes it all the more funnier and odder jones plays the venerable seen it all agent with seriousness and maturity smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones straight man routine they click like dorothy s ruby red shoes the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld the addam s family this guy has a knack for gothic comedy and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen and an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors the story moves well and before you know it the end credits are already rolling the result is minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs aaaahhhs and wows let the men in black protect and color your world 
as i write the review for the new hanks ryan romantic comedy you ve got mail i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet i am also aware that i have just spent the last hours watching the world s biggest paid commercial for america online and i wonder is that so bad well the commercial part is as for the movie well as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan i think i ll be okay to paraphrase james berardinelli whose reviews i admire very much tom hanks and meg ryan can act they are both wonderful but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan and his glorious triumph in philadelphia i like him best when he s suitably obnoxious tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he s going to get the girl the only question is how meg ryan america s high school sweetheart can act she s had a handful of memorable performances including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally i must not mention what she does due to the well um you get the idea and if you don t get the movie fantastic but i like her best when she s well perky she is so adorably perky cute that together with hanks they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples but i don t really know all i know is that i just like them both they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that s really hard to resist and i m not going to even try they re just really really cute sweet and charming hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle here the setup is a little different kathleen kelly ryan owns a small children s bookstore which her mother founded years ago and passed down to her she is successful beautiful and dates a well known columnist with very radical idea kinnear she is also having an affair of sorts you see kathleen with the handle shopgirl is secretly emailing ny they have a strictly un detailed relationship there are no specifics and they have no idea who each other is ny happens to be joe fox hanks a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega bookstores run by his father coleman fox books has decided to open a store on the west side right across from a little children s bookseller named shop around the corner run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly every morning these two email each other silly and every day they fight to the death it s a charming premise and one that works nicely balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have it also has the great sense of being a classic romance there is no let s have sex tonight mantra if you ll excuse my bluntness this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love hmm well the movie goes through twists and turns having some sad moments and happy ones until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan hook up to use modern terminology and kiss their way into happiness you know it s going to happen the question is now thankfully ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey kinnear chappelle and a host of others including a great scene involving brothers aunts and two sweet kids it s all cute and wonderful and for all of the idealism it makes me feel good hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is he is i believe america s greatest actor does he show it here nah but he s still tom hanks and she s still meg ryan which is what this movie boils down to it s pure confection all the bits about the godfather the jokes the superb script it s all really sweet there are some immense flaws like pacing the last third of the movie really doesn t work as well as i would have liked and for a romantic comedy it s slow once hanks knows the secret it gets really slow i even looked at my watch a couple times to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for so that i could get home at a reasonable hour the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated e mail when my kids are my age i don t know what we ll be using but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history they just work together and it s nice to see it gives you well a smile the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was i ve always believed that movies are very powerful very powerful indeed you see mankind has three abilities he needs to survive the ability to think entertain and procreate movies can definitely do the first two and as for the third well i d rather not think about that i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint and that films that entertained you were good because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had hanks was the driving force behind one of the year s best films in saving private ryan which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world he s also half of the glue behind the year s best example of pure entertainment tom hanks and meg ryan are magical as is this movie it s a sweet lovely affair with a technology twist it may be a long commercial but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face 
making his directorial debut actor jon favreau brings along his swingers co star vince vaughn for this tale of two mugs on a career trajectory to nowheresville favreau who also wrote the script is bobby vaughn is ricky by day they are construction workers they also are wanna be contenders but neither has had much success their last bout pitted them against each other and was a draw leaving bobby s record at these two l a not so wise guys also work for max peter falk a mid level mobster who is patient and understanding with bobby but who hates ricky s guts max has an easy job for bobby fly to new york and make a simple delivery to a gangster named ruiz a smooth and silky sean combs bobby because of his lifelong friendship with ricky pleads with max to give his pal another chance and let him tag along to the big apple against his better judgment max agrees of course ricky a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks nearly screws up everything while bobby tries to stay calm and professional ricky begins swaggering and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano the constrast in styles and the chemistry between favreau and vaughn is what makes made so enjoyable to watch favreau with his hound dog face and slow burn personality could be a modern day oliver hardy only much wiser vaughn is like someone vaccinated with a phonograph needle he just keeps yakking and yakking unaware of the havoc he creates yet despite bobby s constant aggravation and agitation with his partner a bond of affection and loyalty binds them the contrast between the two friends is interesting to watch bobby is button downed tightly wound always waiting for the next shoe courtesy of ricky to drop ricky is mostly oblivious to the problems he creates and is genuinely surprised when he comes under attack for his faux paus in new york the two lackeys are like fish out of water stumbling from one situation to another trying to keep alive combs is elegant cool and low key menacing as the gangsta they are sent to meet falk is amusing in his small role while famke janssen nearly breaks your heart as bobby s lowlife girlfriend more than anything made is a movie with heart it is loud obnoxious and very talkative but the cameraderie between bobby and ricky holds the key to its interest favreau does a commendable job in his directorial debut he is a player to be watched as he can only improve with experience 
 minor plot spoilers in review no major spoilers are in review the previous two alien films have each had their own unique styles to them the ridley scott s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film james cameron s aliens was much more of an action film and i liked each film separately for which it was now alien is out and it is it s own film in the same right that alien and aliens were unlike aliens alien requires that you have seen aliens this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off the survivors of the expedition to lv are returning home after battling and beating the aliens the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item an egg in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch find its quarry which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel this vessel crash lands on fury everyone in the vessel is killed except ripley the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash fury is an ex mining maximum security prison when closed down some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years ripley s arrival sparks a problem with the inmates as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner s sport there is an infestation of lice on the planet being an ex prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own i will not go into detail but you can guess what happens here the alien is loose and no one believes ripley s outstanding story she finds comfort in the arms of the colony s doctor yes after years ripley has sex it is not gratuitous in fact we don t even see them kiss but it is just as well a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film there is a lot more gore in alien in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien than either of the earlier two it also sports a new alien with legs i won t say how but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle which i am sure will be explored in alien sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination the rest of the cast is also quite good notably charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury alien has a very distinct look this is due largely to its director david fincher mr fincher who until now has only directed music videos and commercials has done an incredible job here his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no alien film has before for mr fincher i see a long prosperous career ahead of him the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the alien series been set in this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii james horner s aliens this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring this is a great score the ending to alien is quite good there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up but it played very nicely i will not ruin the ending for you go see the film i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season alien is a worthy successor to aliens and alien and when they make alien perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in 
getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity the film was directed by randal kleiser who brought us such bubble gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon but thanks to kleiser s surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script getting it right is a pleasantly quiet moving and memorable film one geared strictly toward a sophisticated adult audience getting it right stars jesse birdsall emily lloyd s boyfriend in wish you were here as gavin a painfully shy year old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who gasp is still a virgin gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon but expose him to a single year old beauty and he s a mess much to gavin s surprise the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan lynn redgrave a rich married and lonely year old getting it right is the simple story of gavin s awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right that is to find the right woman to fulfill his life getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in depth character development gavin s self conscious voice over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self confident maturity birdsall s superb understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film he seems convincing and authentic throughout the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin s life despite her limited screen time redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin s middle aged seducer for a supporting character joan is unusually and impressively complex thanks in large part to redgrave s magnificent performance gavin is also pursued or perhaps plagued by minnie the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat after minnie and gavin meet at a party she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role and sir john gielgud with his tongue in his cheek embodies the height of arrogance as her father gavin s eventual love interest is jenny the adorable twenty year old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon london stage actress jane horrocks fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character peter cook the great british satirist appears briefly in the film as gavin s uptight employer the scenes of gavin s home life with his parents are also a treat gavin s over protective mother pat heywood whom even woody allen would find overbearing almost steals the movie her life seems limited to just two activities treating gavin like a year old and preparing exotic but inedible meals such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce gavin and his father s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing getting it right for the most part is very well crafted except for two minor shortcomings first the movie is about minutes too long and consequently it loses momentum at times second the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin s best friend harry and his unfaithful lover winthrop overall however getting it right is quite memorable for its humor depth sophistication and outstanding acting director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard adapting her own highly acclaimed novel deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth maturation and self discovery 
every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget and forgive its glaring imperfections such is the case with good will hunting a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life despite some serious character problems this is still a very good film you probably know about the plot so i ll make it quick will hunting damon is a janitor at m i t he s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it he likes to go out with his friend chuckie affleck and their other working class buddies and drink beer he s good looking charismatic and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk after getting into a tiff with the law a distinguished professor skarsg rd discovers will s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time at a price he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems that have stumped the academic elite with the professor after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once promising therapist named sean maguire williams who has his own problems in the meantime will meets a british medical school student driver and they begin to fall in love the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film even though we ve seen movies about misunderstood erratic prodigies before shine ring a bell the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn t just focus solely on one character alas though this is not a perfect film as much as you feel like it could ve been while watching it the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent of course is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep human relationships usually yes but is it possible for him to also be so handsome funny quick with the tongue and city street tough not very likely come on usually these guys are total nerds who can t even buy their own shirts much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med school girls will is just a little too perfect and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition the heavy handed anti war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish overlong pompous and completely unnecessary all this sounds pretty bad but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways damon s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable his performance is truly extraordinary which leads me to the really good part of the review the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word acting i can t recall seeing a film recently that was so well acted from top to bottom from minnie driver s frustrated lover to ben affleck s laid back best friend and all the small roles in between the performances are magnificent robin williams skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line the real gem though is stellan skarsg rd s turn as professor lambeau an award winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger smarter will hunting the scenes between williams and skarsg rd as two old college pals who ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid display some of the best acting i ve ever seen when i say delivering the goods this is what i m talking about watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about gus van sant s to die for drugstore cowboy cold urban direction is right on as well as danny elfman s sauntering musical score i highly recommend good will hunting despite its faults it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year 
more than forty years ago the sword and sandals genre of historical epic ruled the box office during the s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope ben hur cleopatra the robe sparticus the fall of the roman empire quo vadis sometimes brilliant sometimes campy the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood since then epics have appeared infrequently the last emperor braveheart and some of the best have been small screen affairs produced in the s roots shogun yet the phrase we who are about to die salute you has been absent until now gladiator begins in germania in a d roman general maximus russell crowe has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius richard harris and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting however the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus joaquin phoenix will prove a poor successor so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again when commodus hears the plan he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered maximus escapes from the executioners but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus place is never explained an african named juba djimon hounsou treats maximus wounds proximo oliver reed a gladiator who won his freedom purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena of course maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier and his fame spreads when commodus reopens the coliseum proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus sister lucilla connie nielsen the similarities to braveheart are obvious an evil king a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family the aid of a lovestruck princess also like mel gibson s epic gladiator has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero s anger it s a simple tale of good versus evil maximus has all the manly virtues nobility of purpose courage in battle loyalty to king and country physical stamina and devotion to family commodus is his opposite in every way a sniveling selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience the opening night crowd in my theater was about male and that seems appropriate gladiator is a guy movie would the opposite of a chick flick be a dick flick there s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences those easily offended by gore should stay away lucilla is the only female character and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance in the scene where commodus kills his father phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father s love or pride throughout the picture phoenix manages to give depth to a character who s scripted as a caricature of evil i ve been a russell crowe fan since romper stomper this role doesn t offer him the complexities of his parts in l a confidential and the insider essentially his job is to grunt heroically but his voice which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp is perfect for the genre the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar my only major quibble with gladiator is its stylized look several scenes are tinted we ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately particularly in payback and the matrix i don t get the appeal of the style which makes feature films look like tv ads in payback it was merely annoying but in gladiator it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d etre of the roman epic perhaps it s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer generated shots also the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books leaving a half blurred trail of images of himself behind with a more realistic look gladiator could be even more satisfying than braveheart because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion bottom line a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices 
the rich man s wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double where the story and characters are so one dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn t be enjoying yourself but somehow the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things not that it s bad it s just that it s been done before and better in my opinion i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre but it s probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet striving helplessly to get out and instead of just flushing him you end up kind of rooting for the little guy that s basically how i felt about this movie i mean it s not very good but it s not completely bad either the wife of the title is josie potenza played nicely by halle berry she is married to tony christopher mcdonald you know the guy who looks like joe piscapo a really stressed out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn t give josie the attention she deserves cough cough thus she is driven into the arms of another man jake golden clive owen near the beginning of the film josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods once there however tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details i m still not quite sure what line of work he s in making the best of her situation josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars one night she meets a stranger named cole peter greene finally getting a meaty role they have dinner together and eventually both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal after learning that she is not happily married cole offers to take care of the problem managing to escape from the psychotic maniac josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband but then one night cole shows up and here is where the fun begins from this point on it s going to be a no holds barred cliche fest ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out and for the most part they re right the rich man s wife has nary one original bone in it s body but who cares if you re looking for good ol dumb suspense movie you can t do much better than this and if you suspense buffs aren t already sold it has a killer of an ending too 
scream has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well during a film class discussion windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are and why sequels never live up to the originals a few rare exceptions are noted but they left out one scream s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america a sequel was unavoidable but luckily the re teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment in fact at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream i would say that scream might even be the better film sidney prescott neve campbell the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro ca in the original scream is now two years older and off to college majoring in theater meanwhile tv journalist gale weathers courtney cox who covered the murders in the first film has since written a book about the dreadful events a book titled stab which has been developed into a major motion picture as scream opens a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of stab and before long a young couple are butchered to death unnoticed in the midst of hysteria this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown copycat sets out to repeat what s been done and finish what hasn t of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film and yes movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds but this is a sequel and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies this is in large part due to williamson s deliciously written script which will easily leave you satisfied as much as the film condemns the use of cliches it is riddled with them but it is done so effectively and with skillful direction by craven that you re not bound to complain i will note however that the whodunit did wind up being the first person i suspected but believe me i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie all the actors outdo themselves here we re not talking oscar performances but cambell cox david arquette as dewey riley and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing the characters remain true to their roots and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years we can see how the events in the first film has affected them but we don t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place the nice thing about scream is that it doesn t seem off kilter from it s predecessor it s a natural smooth and believable as far as horror films go transition from film to film we skip two years but there doesn t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks it flows so well that you feel more like you re reading chapter two of a book long chapters eh than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels scream s entire plot structure correlates completely with the first making for immediate fondness and absorption as i said before scream easily lives up to if not surpassing it s precursor the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream is because it was the first this doesn t mean that it overcasts the unique whimsical humor or overall caliber of it s sequel it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it s own while maintaining it s sought after qualities if ever a film followed it s original so well it would be scream and it makes this a definite must see for all those unbridled scream fans out there scream fits snugly alongside scream and will hopefully receive as many high remarks it would top off the series quite well if it weren t for the fact that two movies don t really make a series it s unlikely to assume that a scream won t appear in the next few years but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror trilogy let s hope they can keep up the fantastic work like they say don t mess with perfection but when a money making smash hit is almost guaranteed who s gonna listen 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff two girls and a guy is a film which is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girls carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and a great deal of dialogue embracing a near real time approach this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr toback for his bantering characters fortunately the film s cast is up to the challenge and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing the film s setup is fairly generic in nature and opens rather unpromisingly we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside a soho loft as they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy more indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation it s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride played with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is a cad all right but a captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the film s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others but by his own innate behaviour whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds carla lou and his unseen sickly mother it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show a typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the sparks begin to fly one of the great touches in the film is how blake when startled by carla s unannounced appearance begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag double teamed by the understandably aggrieved women who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declarations against their verbal jabs surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off limits for this film however it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length and it s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the film s tempo loses its liveliness the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequences fall flat subtle and not quite subtle allusions are made a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter long running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film mr toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc rating in favour of an r and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious if anything two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled from self assured to disconcerted yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr downey jr was arrested on drug charges and it s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character in a monologue to his mirrored reflection blake s self chiding to get his shit together is disquieting in its resonance while mr downey jr s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actresses are solid in more broadly observed roles ms graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actresses involving herself in three successive risky projects two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman she s quite appealing here playing a character at once both dainty and sultry meanwhile ms gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing she tones it down substantially as the film progresses but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox the film was reportedly shot in eleven days filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout two girls and a guy has an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one senses that mr toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it doesn t feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner two girls and a guy falls short of its potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr it s still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly as we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends i m an actor he tells them at one point using the ol tried and tested occupational hazard defense actors lie but not they all seem to agree denzel washington 
 gattaca represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science fiction films it s a genre picture that doesn t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color intelligence and life span they d like for their child and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects those made the old fashioned way are labeled as in valids and confined to the lower rung of society vincent freeman ethan hawke is one such person born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish molded younger brother anton fed up with being second rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation everyday he watches as superior folk make his fantasy a reality determined to do the same vincent meets a dna broker tony shalhoub in a funny cameo who sells fake identities to in valids his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow jude law an ex athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life for a price and the promise of a caretaker jerome supplies vincent with his identity as well as blood skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on the job tests and physical examinations this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card because of his drastically improved status vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca and catches the eye of comely co worker irene uma thurman on the way obsessed with her own minor heart defect she s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn t know is a lie but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure the mission director is murdered two ardent detectives alan arkin and billy bathgate s loren dean determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca and the sole clue they find at the crime scene one of vincent s eyelashes threatens to blow vincent s cover and derail his goal even if gattaca were dramatically empty it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials the film s look is dazzling without ever being flashy first time director writer andrew niccol he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama the truman show demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy retro ambiance an opening credits sequence where skin nail and hair fragments fall in slow motion through a colored camera lens displays these combined talents uncannily niccol even utilizes voice over narration a device almost always poorly employed in an effective way when it comes to acting the movie is also flawless ethan hawke does magnificent work proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side but needfully so adding to the setting s clinical chill as the bitter jerome jude law has a star making presence and it s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core in gattaca s series of final shots the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other and the effect is sad lyrical and beautiful things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax when vincent s relationship with his brother comes back into view the big dramatic culmination is a swim race which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed still the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop it s successful sci fi without showy special effects it s a crisp thriller with character driven thrills it s a futuristic fable without blood and guts even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage although it s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim gattaca serves up one of the most thought provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film 
the event of events is upon us people have waited twenty two years for the prequel to star wars and die hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it i don t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history anyone who tells you it s just a movie is either lying or clueless it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz which is far too weak a word that star wars epsode i the phantom menace so effortlessly generated but that does not mean that the film itself is bad in fact it is terrific i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash it is set some decades before the events of the original star wars took place the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging the trade federation angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small peaceful planet of naboo the republic sent two jedi knights people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as the force qui gon jinn liam neeson and obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor to negotiate unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur the jedi and the queen of naboo natalie portman escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine where they meet the movie s real focal point young anakin skywalker jake lloyd he is an innocent slave boy but the force is strong with him so qui gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi as any self respecting star wars fan should know anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor s movie around of the characters if not more are computer generated in one form or another and though the effects are seamless the movie lacks soul i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far with plenty of broad comic relief to go around much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar jar binks he s essentially a computer animated sidekick who says things like exqueeze me and mesa go now okeday and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying the visual effects are astounding although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them and the movie is a thrilling triumph if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement the climactic lightsaber battle oh come on as if you didn t already know among other things is outrageously entertaining and defines the term popcorn movie what made me surrender and give this movie stars was the score by john williams even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days his work here is nothing short of brilliant his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia when you see a long time ago in a galaxy far far away when the familiar music plays when the words star wars appear on screen you ll feel a tingle even if you didn t see the movie when it first came out in it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin a boy whose innocence we know will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts we know that it will do more harm than good but they do not we not only feel more involved in the story but we feel like we re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years the phantom menace although lacking in human aspects of the story is a very worthy installment in the star wars it works as an action flick visually eye popping and often paralyzingly exciting it also works as an elicitor of memories a piece of exquisite nostalgia eugene novikov 
books could be and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy and rightfully so this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late s early s inspiring literally dozens of clones from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre the special effects were groundbreaking revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it and now george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday s star wars updated with today s special effects wizardry either way the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen where it rightfully deserves to be seen can there be anyone in the world who doesn t know what star wars is about in a way star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it it s a story about a young man s coming of age a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire a tale of swashbuckling and derring do the likes of which haven t been seen on the silver screen in decades strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world it s high adventure incredible special effects and well it s just an experience something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation and it s about to do so again this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film s devoted fans who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now interviews trailers leaks from within lucasfilm all of these have been collected collated and placed on webpages for people to see pages such as http www islandnet com corona films details sw html or my personal favorite http leopard cs latrobe edu au koukoula pictures of before and after have been placed side by side even months before the movies were released fans were making comparisons in some cases the changes were nothing less than phenomenal and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original for instance in my personal favorite example the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep moss covered carvings and etchings and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling booming city with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing all the starships and fighters are now computer animated getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made and they look fantastic four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in simply couldn t do it justice however much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself the negatives badly damaged by the ravages of time were brightened and returned to their original splendor the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt into glorious booming theater shaking full thx dolby digital stereo and that more than the added scenes or new special effects is where the real value of this new version lies it s really true what they say in the commercials star wars loses so much on the small screen even letterboxing doesn t make up for the decrease in size and definition in regard to the star wars special edition and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released i ll make this final recommendation go and see it go and see it more than once it may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it s gone this time take along the youngsters who ve never had the big screen star wars experience you ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time there s magic in this movie special edition or no there can be no denying that it s still star wars and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages from four to four hundred let s all return to that time long ago and that galaxy far far away 
near the end of analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king the following year saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia at best that s all it was a sleeper hit designed to surprise but not shake the industry in however things have been decidedly different there have been a number of pushes on disney s death grip on the market and fifty one weeks into a new champion has emerged dreamworks the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed the other two contenders warner brothers quest for camelot and disney s own annual entry mulan lacked inspiration and drive respectively although camelot was borderline abysmal and can t really be considered a shot at the title mulan had the makings of winner unfortunately it was saturated with traditional disney cute animation and lost points against the rapidly changing face of the competition in making the prince of egypt dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product the animation is flawless and aside from a bug s life is the best looking movie to date the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects and the d d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with the key to success however was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot namely some of the most important action sequences like the parting of the red sea were done almost entirely in d dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ve got the stuff of success and that they re capable of challenging disney the story is also well written and the characters voiced with talent for the most part the plot follows its source material the book of exodus although only in the most general sense the writers took a few creative liberties and most do not damage the story in any way in fact the shakespearean relationship between moses val kilmer and the pharaoh rameses ralph fiennes makes the story more interesting if anything moses a hebrew is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile he floats into the pharaoh seti patrick stewart s palace and is taken in by the royal family moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves by this time rameses is now pharaoh and the two brothers now on opposite sides of the line face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention the cast of voices is most impressive and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock jeff goldblum danny glover and steve martin the script does not have a lot of one liners in it and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams but overall the story is exciting and interesting it s decidedly for an older crowd and the tykes who haven t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost but for those who make the bid the prince of egypt can be a great watch

this is a good year if you want plenty of sci fi on your multiplex from the comedies mars attacks and men in black to luc besson s powerful the fifth element and to this sci fi horror that is event horizon more is on the way with contact and alien ressurection being released later this year the story is thus in an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe instantaneously this is achieved by creating a gateway infact a black hole between the craft and it s required destination in this case from near neptune to proxima prime however when the event horizon attempts this it dissappears without trace leaving two searches for it fruitless seven years later it reappears transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate the team is led by laurence fishburne and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive as the team search the event horizon they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around not a good sign to make matters worse as they search the ship they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago it soon becomes apparent that wherever the ship went it bought something back with it something very very evil the first thing you ll notice in this film is it s incredible visual effects they really are eye popping with some great models to boot the acting is quite good with some occasional witty moments sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team in a cool calm take no nonense manner it is his acting skills that help hold this film together the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one it starts off incredibly well but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur however the closing minutes of the film more than make up for this producing one the most nail biting or in my case straw of my drink biting climaxes i ve recently witnessed overall event horizon is a smart film indeed it s very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals but be warned the horror scenes despite being very brief are very very gory not for the squemish 
look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future some sort of decision had to be made and for better or worse it irrevocably altered the course of your existence from time to time everyone thinks about the roads not taken and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action catching the am train for example could have an equally profound yet less obvious impact maybe that s where you met your significant other and had you reached the platform just a few seconds later film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else and that s why there s no shortage of movies about this subject the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance these themes weave their way through many of his movies including decalogue the double life of veronique and the triptych of blue white and red however they are most explicitly examined in a film called blind chance where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action missing or catching a train changes the course of his life in his autobiography kieslowski on kieslowski the director describes his attraction to the concept this way the idea is rich and interesting that every day we re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we re completely unaware while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films including in a way frank capra s it s a wonderful life sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths the road not taken approach isn t just a plot device either writer director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses catches a train the audience watches with ever growing fascination how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life her future career where she lives whom she loves and whether she has a family as her separate destinies diverge and then re converge she becomes two completely different individuals that woman is helen played by gwyneth paltrow as a long dark haired brit one day after losing her job as an advertising executive she decides to return home in the middle of the day the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform in scenario she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station on board she meets the cheerful talkative james john hannah a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty minutes later in her flat she walks in on her lover gerry john lynch in bed with another woman jeanne tripplehorn in scenario she misses the train and shortly thereafter is the victim of an attempted mugging she doesn t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry s infidelity juxtaposed one against the other while sharing many places cues and characters the two stories proceed in parallel from there on one level for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience but for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting a script with a few twists and a great deal of genuinely funny material sliding doors still fits the bill one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures and those who could care less it shouldn t come as any surprise that the acting at least from three of the four leads is solid paltrow who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same yet gradually become much different is the standout she plays both of her roles effectively and believably the shy insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated platinum blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man john hannah known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral is instantly likable john lynch taking a break from movies about ireland s troubles does a good job presenting gerry as a inept selfish philanderer only jeanne tripplehorn who plays an over the top vixen seems out of place her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring and it s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice douglas mcferran who plays gerry s best friend russell is an absolute delight stealing every scene that he s in part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie on one occasion he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy on another occasion while laughing at gerry s plight with the women in his life he comments being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable but it s not all in the dialogue mcferran tears into this part with relish his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top notch comedy this is the first feature film for peter howitt and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb the script is shrewd and inventive combining wit romance and intelligent melodrama into a crowd pleasing whole sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies however for those who are so inclined its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe all while having a good time 
 take a number fill out a form and wait your turn starring kati outinen kari v n nen sakari kuosmanen elina salo written directed by aki kaurism ki cinematography by timo salminen it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy but that would imply a sense of anger of vitriol of energy drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone it is the sad slow story of lauri and ilona a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward he loses his job as a tram driver because everyone drives cars nowadays within a couple of months she loses her position as a head waiter when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv which she greets with little enthusiasm she notes that they haven t finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn t spoken with such resigned weariness this sets the tone for the rest of the movie there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery but at the centre there is frustration and futility and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal the movie is about two people and what happens to them and nothing else matters lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship respect culture passion they go to the movies and walk out past old posters for l atalante and l argent but the movie they have just seen is a pointless violent unfunny comedy their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ugly greens dull reds insipid blues full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness and director aki kaurism ki often matches the colour of characters clothes with the background colour and or lighting so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love their downward downsized downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic as one setback succeeds another bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs more farce more deadpan wit but the film s great strength is the sober empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona s misfortunes irony would be an injustice situations and settings are broad and exaggerated this is not realism but they are not distorted the emotions are authentic if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens despite the droll performances the laconic humour that s because kaurism ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty eight who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two bit restaurant how humiliating it must be for a man nearing to confront his wife s former employer demanding the rest of her wages only to have the crap beaten out of him unable to land a single punch when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money all this is observed keenly with great economy every cut every line of dialogue is judicious if most films are novelistic in their telling this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the minute running length i have seen many movies far less profound less humane less necessary than drifting clouds but they filled me with an urge to watch them again and this one did not it does not need to be seen twice its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience because it cannot be pitched to one there is no selling point it is all understatement restraint melancholy the characters are unremarkable their best years behind them their dreams dissipated it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills this does not make them less fascinating merely less marketable which is a shame because this is a movie which should be seen precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore it engages us and touches us and resolves surprisingly and movingly into something resembling a happy ending the only thing greater than the ill luck that governs the characters lives is their refusal to give in to despair their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a feel good ending elsewhere but not here because this ending differs in kind from most such endings this one has truly been earned

the thirteenth floor the third in what i would call the reality check movie series is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year the matrix and existenz all three made you think made you wonder what is real what isn t and if our world is just a huge game the thirteenth floor doesn t reach the level of originality creativity and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz but it certainly gives a great shot at it in the matrix we were told that the humans are simply a virus in existenz we learned that our life could be just a game in the thirteenth floor we learn that we are just electronic devices living under another world of electronic devices there is just one world on top of another and everything in them are fake and electronically generated the thirteenth floor took a huge risky turn that i didn t expect it to take and i m not very sure it was such a great turn to make rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller played by armin mueller stahl douglas hall played by craig bierko a man that worked under fuller for many years must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using to the year which consists of computer generated characters only the simulation of is just like it was back in the olden days all of the people involved are just characters or are they douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours and killed fuller along the way douglas interacts with many different potential suspects and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller jane fuller played wonderfully by a talented young actress gretchen mol the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going and doesn t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer s interests i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz and i wouldn t enjoy it but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film unfortunately many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened the scenes that aren t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere leaving you wondering what is the point of this sometimes it was hard to believe that this story with terrible dialogue some bad acting especially from craig bierko and scenes that go absolutely nowhere are actually true i know this isn t a true story or anything but a film should be able to make you think that it is on the plus side of acting we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in actor armin mueller stahl in the thirteenth floor he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances another plus is gretchen mol s realistic performance creating her character with depth not just staying in the one dimensional phase don t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile and shuts you down like any other movie would thrills chills and spills aren t what you will get in this film but you will just get another trip to send your mind on scrambling it until you ve had enough the bottom line let s hope this is the last of the reality check based movies for awhile 
in december of a little movie called scream was released became a box office smash and resurrected films targeted at teens first it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad both scream movies i know what you did last summer urban legend etc but just recently the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre a la s john hughes starting with last june s can t hardly wait it may be the first week of april in but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the and under market almost every single week varsity blues jawbreaker cruel intentions simply irresistible the rage carrie and the mod squad coming april are two more of this type never been kissed and go and on april we ve got the teen satire election and the teen horror comedy idle hands jeesh out of all of these moves however the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation things i hate about you is this past january s mediocre ho hum she s all that although similar in plotting ok darn near identical things i hate about you a modern day version of shakespeare s the taming of the shrew she s all that got its inspiration from pygmalion is an infinitely superior film in every department from the smart direction by first time feature director gil junger to the charming and well written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since s the breakfast club and to top it all off in the inevitable climax set at the prom at least we didn t have to once again suffer through a goofy inappropriate dance sequence who could forget or want to remember for that matter this ludicrous development in she s all that the day wide eyed shy new student cameron james joseph gordon levitt starts school at seattle based padua high he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore bianca stratford larisa oleynik although he doesn t know french he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father larry miller won t allow her to date until her bitter unconventional older sister kat julia stiles a senior decides to kat of course has sworn off the likes of boys but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger complicating matters cameron s dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides to use a wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also has his sights set on bianca as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey as you can see things i hate about you includes a huge number of characters some of which i haven t even mentioned such as kat s shakespeare obsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and bianca s materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union at a short but well used running time of minutes all of the characters are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated as caricatures another flaw of she s all that where the bad guys and gals ran around constantly saying you re vapor since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained aside from a good screenplay it s the performances that can make or break a movie and director junger has really hit the jackpot aside from joseph gordon levitt rd rock from the sun who gives his strongest performance to date here none of the actors are that well known but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings as the main character of kat julia stiles last seen in the miniseries the s is marvelous and always believable and certainly has a bright future ahead of her even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard edged it was easy to identify with kat s way of thinking she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath and i completely admired her individuality no one i think could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does heath ledger as the infamous bad boy of the town injects much life into patrick and has a lot of chemistry with stiles one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith is able to turn bianca into a person with multi dimensions even though she is accurately self centered at the on set in one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she has one off beat element of the film and a source of some hearty laughs is the way that the school s staff act which is strikingly unformal allison janney as the guidance counselor ms perky who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel is comic dynamite as is daryl chill mitchell as the english teacher who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and at one point sends kat to the office because for once she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning most of it actually works especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters in one very funny scene chastity asks i know people can be overwhelmed and they can be underwhelmed but can people just be whelmed at another point bianca and kat s father a stand out larry miller who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion before she leaves she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it s like to be pregnant things i hate about you once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the s it also helps that the movie has a perfectly assembled soundtrack mixing indie rock with new wave s songs and with thank goodness no rap by the film s end it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca kat and her father and a flawlessly acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class this is where the title comes from luckily i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about things i hate about you but the positive aspects of the film far out number ten 
for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend there are certain rules that he needs to follow firstly fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship secondly buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes thirdly find the perfect moment and location to propose finally the groom wannabe should probably get her parent s blessing of these four the last one can be a nightmare meeting parents is a rite of passage fraught with unexpected questions bouts of nervousness the reality of being disliked and the inability to make a positive impression if you re lucky things will go smoothly but if you re greg focker ben stiller everything will go wrong and with a name like that how could it not when greg first meets his fianc e s father jack byrnes the grimacing robert deniro greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive when he tells jack that he s a male nurse the incorrigible dad shoots back not many men in your profession huh greg it s definitely not a good start but greg is determined to win him over and it s this desire that fuels the movie he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner it doesn t matter that he s jewish if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace then that s what he s going to gamely do oh god you re such a good god he moons his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle but when jack gives him the deniro squint that familiar unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility it s pretty hard not to grin things get progressively worse for greg and that s too bad because he s a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart eventually he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up committing a host of gaffes that embarrass humiliate or injure other people it s a never ending ordeal of missteps miscues and mistakes he buys some champagne but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances he tries to find jack s missing cat but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble and there are several other episodes each one trumping the next in outrageousness the more our well meaning beau screwed up the more the audience groaned in sympathy we liked greg and we liked this movie meet the parents is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments just sit back and watch greg get into trouble no matter what the situation whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house things will horribly go wrong we laugh at greg s expense but love often makes a person do dumb things and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool deniro is also affable tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside their tug of war is often funny the slapstick is elaborate and there are several topical throwaway gags mostly targeted at the airline industry to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in laws from hell

robert benton has assembled a stellar mature cast for his latest feature twilight a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames gene hackman and susan sarandon a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight when jack sends him on a routine delivery job however the old instincts kick in soon harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line and he no longer knows who to trust there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight in addition to newman hackman and sarandon james garner plays raymond hope a former cop and one of harry s best friends stockard channing plays verna harry s former partner and possibly a former love interest reese witherspoon is mel the distrustful daughter of the ames and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend giancarlo esposito appears as harry s bumbling detective protigi and john spencer is a suspicious police captain with a cast like that it s almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze luckily there s more to the film than some sort of actor s recognition ceremony twilight has a solid film noir ish plot it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days the major cast members all deliver strong performances as can be expected of their caliber however none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable the supporting cast is enjoyable if a little underdrawn stockard channing s character in particular is a cipher there s more to her character than the film takes the time to describe it s a minor but irritating flaw with a solid cast and a good plot there s a lot to recommend about twilight it s biggest flaw is actually its short running time at a slim minutes there s a lot of stuff that s packed into an awfully small package still the chance to see newman sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two 
people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple techno thriller in such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked but i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff film directed by philip kaufman the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits but the right stuff film isn t even fiction it was based on the non fiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program the plot of the film begins in when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age in order to regain national prestige us government decides to be the first to send man into space best air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired all american image in one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top films made in s such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman s film looks quite atypical for its time with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for s and s age when hollywood used to make films larger than life but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation in s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies the right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risk taking artsy projects the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film the plot is almost non existent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts the film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty on the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases shepard s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean cut marine and future politician john glenn young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard kaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice president lyndon b johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman s superb direction most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world in that setting it s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights but the times are changing ww alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots their entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicity seeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman s superb use of poetic movie language editing is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space another fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period this film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws some of the mercury astronauts aren t fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure on the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long also some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan s america in some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early s time has passed now we don t see astronauts as heroes in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up but this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky and even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema 
in director brett ratner and his stars jackie chan and chris tucker breathed new life into the buddy action film genre with the cross cultural rush hour to the tune of about million you don t mess with success so the team is back again and better in rush hour the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in rush hour that played well to audiences around the world the formula worked so well in fact that the sequel was inevitable i m never thrilled with the idea of a follow up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations surprisingly rush hour wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it the script by jeff nathanson utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film wastes no time getting to the point right from the start terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong killing two american translators and chief inspector lee jackie chan is handed the job of solving the crime concurrently his friend james carter chris tucker arrives on the island for some much needed r r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights instead lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars the makers of rush hour are working at a distinct advantage over the original we the viewer are familiar with the two lead characters and the already existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around that chemistry was a high point and probably the saving point before and now the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in rush hour first and foremost to me in rh is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan s artistry in fight choreography the year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and here he does not disappoint chan s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand such as a trash bucket his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding on the tail end of a yacht in a hong kong massage parlor and for the finale in a las vegas casino like harold lloyd or buster keaton chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop carter who teams again with lee to put down the bad guys when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case he still looks to have some fun when lee goes into a karaoke bar the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan john lone and his hoods carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and with jackie chan has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills the combo of chan s flying feet and fists with tucker s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the lethal weapon films the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently john lone as ricky tan is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign alan king in a walk through performance lone doesn t chew scenery or make pronouncements to get lee and carter but gives the chief bad guy elegance zhang zi yi crouching tiger hidden dragon continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky s taciturn henchlady hu li who carries on an ongoing battle with carter carter has a problem through most of the film with hitting a woman but this falls aside with their eventual one on one melee at the conclusion roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous and resembles sandra bullock as undercover agent isabella molina she doesn t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch director ratner and the original rush hour production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera cinematographer matthew f leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives rh the fluid camera movement the genre film needs production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino the rest of the techs are of the same high quality i m surprised to even say that rush hour is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out so far this summer i give it a b 
that s the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into the wedding singer the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus does he draw laughs from his sad puppy dog expression and don t hate me for being a simpleton observations or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over well there s a little bit of all of that in the wedding singer and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr sandler s thing i did have a surprisingly good time that s because in a nutshell the wedding singer is one of the sweetest movies you re ever likely to come across that s right sweet the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh out loud hysterical but the tone well it s just lovely i have to admit i was half expecting farting armpit humor gratuitous nudity superfluous cloying subplots and some nasty unnecessary violence instead well i ve said it before sweet the year is and sandler plays robbie hart the eponymous wedding singer a job aspiring rock stars often settle for when robbie s fianc e dumps him at his own altar robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia drew barrymore who has some problems of her own she s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who unbeknownst to her isn t that big on monogamy it isn t giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love aww sandler and barrymore are a good match and they re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances including steve buscemi and jon lovitz whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film writer tim herlihy with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion it doesn t all work but it s handled with such light heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights sounds and affectations of the s the soundtrack an ever present force in the film is packed with wall to wall hits of the period new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol s white wedding to the smiths how soon is now to culture club s do you really want to hurt me the mix of music and fashion would make the wedding singer a great double feature with boogie nights if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs then the wedding singer is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride if you re a fan of the lovable laughable adam sandler well let s just say that the wedding singer might well be the only film in recent memory to make me want to rent happy gilmore 
 good will hunting is two movies in one an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood prodigy child film complete with upbeats downfalls sporadically moving situations and plenty plenty of shtick unusually directed by gus van sant good will hunting overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh new talent the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor stellan skarsgard who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams in a nutshell that s it the core of the good will hunting is damon who infuses the script co written by chasing amy s ben affleck with just the right amount of warmth sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi talented performer but it s the acting that hits the mark and damon hits all the right notes flying over robin williams deja vu role awakenings was written all over this as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife s tragic death damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein his rich complex character is the pulp of good will hunting everything else pales in comparison good will hunting exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling but unlike little man tate or phenomenon it doesn t set up its story in a black and white point a to point b be manner but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn t automatically signify he must make easy familiar choices like the protagonists in the aforementioned 
showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry spiced tabasco sauce a dish not to everyone s taste but certainly a well crafted movie possibly that movie s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the characters future so there was no need to film it there was actually about four hours worth of screen story there but eszterhas found ways to get it all on screen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent characters we have shows for the eyes and the ears plotlines that play on several levels we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable and we have a story of an innocent who may not be so innocent who s trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slips into behaving the way those around her do but recovers with a flourish and quits a winner in this sense the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven who s not known for treating his characters well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in a positive way and we re left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movies but it s far better than we d been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in and in the last quarter century has pushed farther and farther experimenting with the socially acceptable limits to movie making his most recent three movies robocop total recall and basic instinct have been a progression of back door access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives and now he s exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating although his original version is available on video many reviewers have taken the politically correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies it s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common and why such an environment should exist it s about the scum who use other people as power trip toys and the need to escape their power it s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don t pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment an nc movie which isn t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been a good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator if anything it s a rape scene with a victim who s been duped into cooperation you don t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors you don t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed and you don t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls and in an awful lot of vegas shows an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity showgirls de glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness nomi is played in a very good performance by elizabeth berkley who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who s at the end of her rope desperate to live a life better than the one she s known she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker trying to be something better than she seems destined to be when nomi realizes she s gone too far for too little she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be gina rivera plays molly a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi providing her with what may be the one solid positive relationship in nomi s entire life molly is the one who makes the difference and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she ll be using for the rest of her life and nomi s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi s decision gina gershon plays cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer a reflexively competitive manipulator who s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch a fading talent made bitter by self awareness her character is very well drawn and performed in a major scene in a hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence passes the torch to nomi the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe molly is an honest hard working person who means well and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality cristal is a talented dancer who s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co operating part of the system exchanging self respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas nomi believes she can make it without selling herself succumbs to a degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and doesn t need las vegas or its brand of stardom the male parts in this movie are simply props they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs camouflaged as a nice guy glenn plummer plays a dancer who s working as a bellboy and provides a bit of alternate perspective plummer s character is the only one in the movie who s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art but even he s succumbed to the cult of manipulation plummer s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie some of jost vacano s cinematography is fantastic and one particular delineation of nomi s character alteration a no dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting is utterly terrifying this movie is rated nc due to language sexual situations full frontal nudity violence and probably the costuming as well i don t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie making but don t go see it if you re not in a tough mood the only person it s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i c u on life support and there is probably not one character in this movie you d enjoy meeting in person 
not too many people know who james whale is but it s a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies if we are to believe the semi biographical gods and monsters whale would have wanted it to be that way this is an insightful haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale s life because it tracks only the final few days of his life and it s probably a better movie for it it s focus is on whale s ian mckellen untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone brendan fraser it begins with whale a fairly talented artist aside from being a director asking boone to sit for him pose for a portrait at first boone doesn t realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man when he does discover whale s sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid lynn redgrave he is frightened refusing to sit for the guy but he comes back only to storm out again disgusted with whale s locker room talk boone returns yet another time after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned locker room talk and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening meanwhile jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago his ailment leads to desperation and depression which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser s bravura performance up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in blast from the past for example i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here this is impressive because his character s dialogue is minimal with mckellan doing most of the talking that requires fraser to act through body language a difficult skill to master but something he proves capable of doing well this is not to ignore mckellan s oscar nominated turn he earned that nomination with his touching performance here although at the risk of sounding like a philistine i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination an understated compelling gem whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield he rejoiced in being free from it only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people in the end perhaps it is what killed him the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare eugene novikov 
it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child whether that may be in life or in death after having said that i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well one gets that choking sensation in the throat because of grief when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement there is no ocean no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ordinary people in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing not that this literally happened in the movie so what are the lessons learnt don t take your children to class reunions don t leave them alone in the lobby not even for a second michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly strung wife and mother a trend that started with a thousand acres and one fine day my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie so much so that when she has a nervous break down the veins on her temples bulge impressively whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance playing a lesbian cop with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop lastly who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie my grandmother comes to mind 
plot during a week span in london in the fall of jack the ripper a man whose identity was never uncovered committed five ritualistic grisly murders of prostitutes this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century old mystery critique awesome i love dark movies i love stylish movies i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp so yes i really dug this movie the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously and this movie my friends is very serious in fact it s also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell it ain t for the kids i ll tell you that much and if any of those recent hack directors of two bit scream esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective kill scenes do not look any further because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner especially when compared to their generic slice and dice contrivances in fact most of this film s structure is very creative the actors all solid the atmosphere and feel of the picture remarkably real gotta love those unfortunates and the descent into darkness well honed by the filmmakers you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time but it s also an impressive mystery film based on the true life tale of jack the ripper a man whose identity was never discovered the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel from hell written by alan moore and presents a compelling story which despite being a little oliver stone ish did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem sexual depravity drug usage insanity murders and love yes the brothers even managed to slip a little love story in here and despite not truly being developed i guess it could ve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already that s right there s no real need to put any romance in a film about a mass murderer but that aside you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities to center this movie all the way through sure he s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie but she was fine and how little the dreams fantasies of depp s character had to do with the film s development from what i had seen in the trailer i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story but thankfully it wasn t on the downside the film doesn t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development but then again a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement i mean the less i knew about each person the more suspicious i became of each one s motives reasons etc in fact i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end and that was in part due to the distance to which i d been held from the film s characters or am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention perhaps overall this is an extremely creepy production with glorious cinematography reminiscent of coppola s dracula and burton s sleepy hollow a grim score and solid acting but it s not for everyone some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events and even though the murders aren t shown as graphically as you might think there s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable gothic atmosphere and this flick is just that and plenty more and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper s haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon brrrrr where s joblo coming from the crow dark city dracula jfk the nightmare before christmas the ninth gate the others quills shadow of the vampire sleepy hollow 
i m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks which is obviously the work of a deranged genius when tim burton s twisted alien invasion comedy really works it s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure and when it doesn t work it s just dull i m not even sure it works more often than it doesn t but where it counts that is when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come mars attacks is brilliant mars attacks is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the s and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer s independence day old alien invasion flicks disaster movies and big budget special effects extravaganzas but unlike independence day which was a painfully middle of the road appeal to the hearts minds and wallets of america mars attacks has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings mars attacks portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are the title sequence is just splendid an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman s thundering theremin driven score is absolutely jaw dropping it s so overwhelming that i swear to you i had trouble breathing the movie lays low for the next minutes we get a glimpse of the alien leader resplendent in a purple sequined cape when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world naturally the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming but mostly the first act is spent developing characters setting up mildly comic situations and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton it s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens because burton s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars anyone who comes to mars attacks expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed with few exceptions these characters are dispatched as the film progresses jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr strangelove s buck turgidson glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house s kennedy room a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big haired pointy breasted sexpot lisa marie the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood in an earlier scene it s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j fox is her newsman husband the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles they blew up congress and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace jim brown and tom jones are the film s vegas based heroes and director barbet schroeder reversal of fortune has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president also on hand and underutilized are annette bening pierce brosnan pam grier lukas haas and natalie portman the latter two also show up in woody allen s everyone says i love you the real stars of course are the computer generated martians and they re fantastic with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull faces round egg eyes with red pupils darting this way and that these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate joe dante s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory but burton s little monsters are more inventive the film s raison d etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault easter island is turned into a bowling alley and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans the sheer level of mayhem is staggering especially when the aliens make their first attack blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg rating it s earned the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day although mars attacks was in production long before that film s release cinematographer peter suschitzky who makes the most of wynn thomas s wildly imaginative production design thomas helped define the spike lee style actually took time off from his mars attacks regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg cronenberg s movie will almost certainly be more somber it won t be released in the u s until early next year but mars attacks is surely a similarly elegant nightmare this is not a nice movie and which studio executive was duped into giving burton million to make it by setting the film s final scenes in the nearly empty holocaust ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided burton s invasion epic suggests that the world we ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead the victims of his invasion are naive greedy or disastrously self absorbed and a good thing too since the movie s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish fulfillment fantasy the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers who triumph by determining that the alien invaders the ultimate elitists are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture ultimately this messy masterpiece is the year s funniest comedy and a weird winking affirmation of the power of the people 
it stands as a moment one will not soon forget a giant green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek dreamworks second computer animated feature but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema a page of this tale serves as that ogre s toilet paper from this opening moment one can infer shrek s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard disney esque fairy tale although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship courage and acceptance excelled by outstanding direction stunning actor voice work and most importantly a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline shrek the previously mentioned ogre holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider known only as the donkey his species who talks and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines along the journey to rescue fiona donkey s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self acknowledgment but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant fire breathing dragon guarding fiona either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them secondly upon shrek s and donkey s redeeming of princess fiona the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her to satisfy her desire for a human knight in shining armor throughout this storyline shrek faces his deep perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth but eventually shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it if one sets his her mind to overcoming something in particular endless possibilities exist after the friendships and courage prevail the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development acceptance surprisingly fiona holds a dark secret of her own due to a spell cast upon her years ago she transforms into an ogre by night in this storyline fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself and she must realize what beauty truly means to simply act as one s self upon fiona s learning of shrek s desire to pursue a relationship with her fiona knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work gives in to her inner demons of self ridicule and hatred any child can pull from fiona s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self acceptance on the technical side shrek triumphs directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers shrek eddie murphy donkey and cameron diaz princess fiona myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other normal beings murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona giving the princess ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay written by ted elliott terry rossio joe stillman and roger s h schulman the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike capping it off with a constant tongue in cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers with shrek dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come the smaller children will laugh and cheer the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages 
trekkies roger nygard s energetic and hilarious documentary brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non fans alike the film generally writes off the trekkies vs trekker polemic as not worth arguing about the good spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable loud giggles yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe denise crosby who played tasha yar on star trek the next generation serves as the host in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary oed the oed cites a february caption in the new yorker as the first recorded usage of the word unless you ve been to the conventions i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans one pointed out apologetically that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams arguably the most famous of all the trekkies she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die hard fans do her claim to fame is that as a juror on the whitewater trial she wore it in court as well every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan like stoicism she says describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession she doesn t quite understand all of the uproar i m an officer of the federation hours a day she reminds us her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith along with the laugher the show evokes there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment few other avocations could give this much satisfaction these people are having the time of their lives for the record i m not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies the film interviews the various star trek series s stars as well as its fans the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade but over twenty years later the conventions are still going strong filled with anecdotes the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions at one the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel after appearing briefly he drank some water and left they decided to auction off his half empty glass joking that it had the q virus the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity not just flitting among people the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies one guy is a trekkie cross dresser another dresses her cat and then there is the dentist the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set he his oral hygienists his receptionist his wife and his kids wear the outfits all of the time it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home but not his family for variety he and his family do change characters from time to time he says his patients like it well there was this one complainer but he had a problem with his bill anyway there are summer schools for klingon with ph d linguists to teach the language hamlet is now available in klingon albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore and they are working on translating the bible they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs even u s customs the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series s larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns sandwiched in between the levity the switch in tone doesn t work the incessantly up beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator he fits right in trekkies runs a breezy it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages 
for more than a decade anjelica huston has been one of america s finest actresses in her directorial debut bastard out of carolina based upon dorothy allison s largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth in post world war ii south carolina through voice over narration done by laura dern we find that she nearly didn t survive birth as her single mother anney played by jennifer jason leigh was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident that s just the beginning of her troubles bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come anney meets and weds lyle a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident anney s brother earle played by michael rooker introduces her to glen played by ron eldard a co worker at the mill glen the black sheep of a wealthy family when are you gonna make your daddy proud i ll tell you when never he s told and filled with bitterness courts anney and eventually wins her despite warnings of a violent temper when anney miscarries with his much prized baby boy glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone beating and abusing her while the love dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment while set several decades ago this story remains completely relevant in today s society where abused wives return to their husbands and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other the real star of this domestic drama is not top billed jennifer jason leigh but child actress jena malone who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance her work is of award calibre and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged kirsten dunst tina majorino anna paquin natalie portman christina ricci elijah wood malone s performance stands up well leigh s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine although she s not really given much to do and ron eldard work is very solid skillfully manouvering his character s moods in and out of explosive rage one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure cooker ticking away of the supporting cast special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker s performance there s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms to the familiar sight of a dried up uptight wise old granny played by grace zabriskie sitting on the porch rocking chair to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance still it cannot be denied that anne meredith s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power huston s direction of the film is surehanded and impressive giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast particularly the young malone her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard hitting emotional rather than graphic manner and are very effective huston s talent with camera positioning is wonderful from a visually striking shot done through a fan to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile the film has the toned down feel of a television production bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing 
jean luc picard patrick stewart and the rest of the crew of the u s s enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the s series star trek gone are kirk spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek the next generation as usual a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist s will it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction it doesn t do a bad job other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek fan only jokes while many of the others just fall flat the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet why do they have to be moved the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f murray abraham s aliens who number only a couple of dozen so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion at least that s plausible but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen which makes no sense whatsoever the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf michael dorn the trusty klingon worf was on star trek the next generation so they want to include him in the films no problem so far worf is now a character of star trek deep space nine so the writers have to find a way to have him show up in the last star trek movie first contact the included worf in a credible fashion in this one the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren t hanging on every word on the screen my minor problems with the movie aside star trek insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones while many of the jokes do miss the mark many are pretty good even for non trekkies the special effects are among the best for the star trek series the action is plentiful and well done this is a very good looking movie it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek the next generation that the acting is first rate it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series if you ve always hated star trek there is nothing here that is going to change your mind star trek insurrection is not the best film in the series but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones 
before even seeing a single frame of the film it would be easy to snicker at deep impact in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet it is the latest entry in this decade s dubious revival of the s disaster film and the first of two the sky is falling flicks to hit screens this year the other being this coming july s armageddon in which a meteor is the threat its tagline oceans rise cities fall hope survives is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight they came in alone the only way out is together but it s every bit as treacly the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions such as the usual opening roll call in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced the most prominent of the personal stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner tea leoni who is distraught that her father maximilian schell left her mother vanessa redgrave for a younger woman rya kihlstedt what is just as snicker worthy is how this co venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high profile corporate collaboration microsoft and nbc s cable news network msnbc which employs jenny who is the film s ostensible main character in the vision of america presented here msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante s peak but there s one thing about deep impact i underestimated the skills of director mimi leder she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc s smash er which is essentially a weekly disaster movie each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold to make the audience care for these guest characters regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are and powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy handed or overly melodramatic having passed the er challenge in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen as the countdown to impact progresses the ominous feeling of doom is palpable leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension there s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects situations that initially feel contrived such as jenny s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner leelee sobieski and comet discoverer leo biederman elijah wood achieve some poignance and even the more vaguely drawn characters including u s president tom beck morgan freeman astronaut spurgeon fish tanner robert duvall and his rather faceless crew ron eldard jon favreau mary mccormack blair underwood and alexander baluyev aboard the comet bombing spacecraft messiah have their share of touching moments the latter fact owes a debt to the actors who all do a solid job and are well cast with the possible exception of leoni she delivers a decent performance but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister it is the first of the s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true a film that makes a genuine impact even if it isn t as deep as hoped 
trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors steve buscemi he gave memorable performences in in the soup fargo and reservoir dogs now he tries his hand at writing directing and acting all in the same flick the movie starts out awfully slow with tommy buscemi hanging around a local bar the trees lounge and him pestering his brother it s obvious he a loser but as he says it s better i m a loser and know i am then being a loser and not thinking i am well put the story starts to take off when his uncle dies and tommy not having a job decides to drive an ice cream truck well the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a year old girl named debbie chloe sevigny and i liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation after you ve seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs you know he is capable of a better performence i think his brother michael did an excellent job for his debut performence mr buscemi is off to a good career as a director 
the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer director producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director he really is he wrote this film he directed this film he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after years has not lost it s popularity or it s ability to scare the wits out of people i think i have seen halloween over times and each time i find something new and brilliant and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen i own three different versions of the film a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition th anniversary t shirt a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow globe in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only and being truly good it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of copies i knew i had to buy one no matter what i did and man to me it s the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film no words can describe the dvd in halloween michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood years ago in now in grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield illinois followed by his past doctor sam loomis the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut why is he stalking her check out halloween ii it explains it all on this unholy night on october laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives which is trying to stay alive the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did what john carpenter did in is made a ground breaking new film with scares wit and style the movie is flawless if not perfect no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one and in my opinion never will halloween will be like psycho and still be extremely popular even almost years later i just hope someday halloween will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the extra scenes on the dvd edition halloween isn t just another slice and dice horror flick it s an intelligent horrifying and best film experience ever made see halloween and be scared then watch it again reviewed by brandon herring october 
 living out loud is the type of motion picture we don t often see it is a film about mature intelligent adults instead of the usual american film in which children basically dress up in grown up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven year olds judith holly hunter a fortysomething living in new york city has been having a difficult time with life lately she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband martin donovan who had been cheating on her she cannot sleep haunted by terrible memories often imagines off the wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers liz bailey queen latifah perform at a local club judith s life does start to brighten a little when one night when she gets home to her apartment late strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator pat danny devito a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other seeking comfort with the other person but while pat starts to form a deep love for her judith only wants to remain friends living out loud which was written by richard lagravenese the bridges of madison county who is also making his directing debut here is a wonderful film from beginning to end one that is honest genuinely funny and poignant the three central characters that of judith pat and liz are all written to be free thinking complex human beings and are all likable but flawed people who are constantly interesting as is the film itself one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen sometimes it results in comedy and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself reading a novel an older woman comes over to her mentions that that is a great book she is reading and then goes over to join her own friends as the woman sits down she looks over to see judith by herself and motions for her to come join them instantly we realize this was simply in judith s mind as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here hunter of course was brilliant in s the piano for which she won an academy award but in this film she is even better i think she finds the right note for each scene and holds it and devito has never had such a humanistic role before which i was surprised about usually he is used as the butt of a joke or as a caricature but in this film has a living and breathing sympathetic person to play topping it all off is latifah also a singer who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself and has a juicy natural supporting role as in some ways judith s role model another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived happy ending but in staying with its realistic tone manages to be upbeat but truthful the last shot is an especially powerful image nothing is said but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all the relationship that results between judith and pat is true to life and sincere as we watch these two people talk and get to know each other all that we wish for them both is to be happy even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved and as living out loud which is one of the best films of the year proves sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for 
any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing down of the experience to make it more accessible to the general public or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh human traffic a new film exploring the british underground party rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing pubbing drugs sex and the beautiful beautiful music is an example of how it really ought to be done the film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties drugs dancing sex pop culture discussions relationships and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts the cast of character consists of jip john simm our narrator who has a bit of a problem with his willy known as mr floppy koop shaun parkes our black dj maestro who has insecurity issues afraid his girlfriend nina nicola reynolds is shagging other men nina herself can t stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends lulu lorraine pilkington jip s best mate is tired of her cheating boyfriends and moff danny dyer can t seem to escape the black hole of his awful life the film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love friendship and self fulfillment all against the raging party background human traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive as director justin kerrigan s subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action the use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace and the acting is confident however the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed human traffic does not try to explain the rave scene instead it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers friends and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace 
until i saw the night of the hunter it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie forget the others and the deep end which veered toward strained dramatics the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i ve seen so far this year even though the movie is nearly years old and there s a not drop of blood to be seen luckily the night of the hunter charles laughton s first and final directing gig has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re released in october so there s still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place robert mitchum stars as harry powell a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash his newest target is young mother willa harper shelley winters whose murderer husband ben peter graves has hidden somewhere powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs harper after he s released and ben is hanged but finding the money isn t easy for powell who must contend with his stepchildren billy chapin and sally jane bruce who know where the money is but aren t telling the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin no i m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem yes there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter powell s love and hate knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing remember radio raheem and powell s black suit with black tie and white shirt could have shaped quentin tarantino s early visual style seeing the night of the hunter for the first time i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears he s like the senior class president with an evil streak if i ever need to stay awake i ll just picture him crooning leaning leaning any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez who create a series of haunting surreal shadowy images over the rural depression era backdrop it s a testament to both men that they re able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline kids harassed by evil guardians by sticking to the old maxim that we re more scared by what we don t see screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters the drunk birdie james gleason who s haunted by his wife and the spoons evelyn varden and walt spoon whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act the only lapse is the movie s third act when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly bible reading mrs cooper lillian gish her showdown with powell is memorable a battle done with dueling hymns however the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone but it s still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun do yourself favor and don t miss this if it comes to a nearby theater note a series of revealing but overlong outtakes preceded the movie the highlights included the legendary laughton who sounds eerily like mr pitt from seinfeld running winters lines with mitchum and the adorable tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile hours more of such footage exists as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling screened as part of the new york film festival retrospectives feature story coming soon 
 the fugitive is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made it takes realistic believable characters and tells an exciting story that s totally believable throughout this isn t an over the top action flick for the sake of action this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly harrison ford stars as dr richard kimble a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder but is not told in a straightforward manner we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble s perspective hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble s wife helen sela ward was murdered we don t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story in fact we might even have a little doubt about kimble s innocence ourselves the film doesn t spend much time on the details of kimble s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated it is actually suspenseful to watch this movie is so incredible because it s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard a u s marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other most of the film deals with richard s complex investigation as he tries to find the one armed man who killed his wife ford does not have a lot of lines here so it is stuart and twohy s script and davis s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits disguising himself and doing his own detective work is very interesting we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed so as he learns more so do we meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues but richard is just too smart for them he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo pantoliano and biggs roebuck they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer yet they constantly start up small talk with each other making funny wisecracks and one liners but not in any kind of distracting manner the final act concludes with another terrific chase richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him and although we get a typical fight scene the case is far from solved the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along and we don t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together maybe the finally scene is a bit much but it still has a believable atmosphere to it we re so relieved when justice is served it s not the plot is that makes the fugitive great it s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous if only hollywood could produce more movies like this see also nick of time 
in october of audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer the film went on to gross over million dollars in the u s and even developed a cult following much like the previous year s million dollar grossing scream when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend it looked like a wonderful follow up did it live up to the first film the answer is no jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before she has been so upset since the incident nightmares haunt her all over the place but she has to move on she know attends college and is best friends with a funny outgoing girl named karla brandy who is trying to hook julie up with will benson played by newcomer matthew settle karla s boyfriend is tyrell the funny outgoing type who is played by soul food s mekhi phifer freddie prinze jr also returns as ray julie s boyfriend from a year ago one morning julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil of course they answer it correctly and they are off to the bahamas julie wants ray to come but he declines the offer so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie after they arrive at their hotel it is just them and the staff on the island it starts off as the weekend of their dreams something just had to come to mess up the one care free weekend of julie s life though ben willis muse watson is back and he isn t letting anyone survive this time will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances brandy in particular was impressive considering this is her first feature film you could see that the characters were horrified and they would do anything possible to survive matthew settle and freddie prinze jr are a completely different story let s start with settle matthew is completely fake in this film you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth you could tell he was acting and its reasons like him that this one isn t as good as the first one he does do a good job towards the end but that doesn t clear up the scars he already left on the film freddie prinze jr is almost as bad as matthew settle was he is almost completely unbelievable and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place we don t see him as much as settle otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell but yet again the dialogue is out of place the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one it would have been a bit better the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel the sound is pretty good but still not as creepy as the first film s jennifer love hewitt s song how do i deal is also played for about thirty seconds i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film the first film was very suspenseful and it contained some very memorable scenes the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up and almost reached the same level as the first film before this part in the film there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares that is okay though because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes i think the reason this film wasn t as scary as the original was because in the first one the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident he made them suffer for what they did in the second film ben willis just kills anyone he feels like he doesn t stick with ray and julie who were the ones he is actually after he had to go after karla will and tyrell if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie ray helen and barry it could have been much better and it would have made a lot more sense the bottom line not a disappointment but a third in the series would be out of hand 
full metal jacket very much like every other hard hitting film about the vietnam war is an shocking emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man private joker played by matthew modine during his tour in the vietnam war however full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before boot camp these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning as in platoon full metal jacket gets off to a quick start the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits which is getting their heads shaved from there they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman played extremely well by the former drill instructor r lee ermey apparently the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence vincent d onofrio whom is dubbed gomer pyle by sgt hartman the film is continually narrated by private joker in which he explains his visions on what is going on the entire corps although repeatedly hammered by sgt hartman continues on private pyle however seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation and it basically does not stop that is until sgt hartman comes up with a new plan he will punish the rest of the soon to be marines for pyle s goof ups even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits and things take a turn for the worst pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally physically and mentally cut out for the life of a marine after graduation joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war which is his service he is not a member of the infantry and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat when he sets out on a documenting mission this question becomes very clear from the start joker joins up with a platoon along with his hometown friend cowboy arliss howard and follows their everyday actions interviewing and filmming them along the way he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight or die again as in the tradition of vietnam war films full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti war film or not a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam as have others in the past this film in different ways also can be viewed as more powerful than others that again is up for debate and depends on your opinion one thing is for sure however no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to unfortunately many did 
director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days terry gilliam comes to mind as another one film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential the film almost automatically deserves a good review and when they add a fascinating story to it you have nearly perfect entertainment fincher s the game is no exception to this the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time fincher hasn t made a film since seven his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever so it is about time he made another film and what a ride it is the game isn t quite as powerful as seven but in some ways it is better overall the game could have used a little more clarity or a little more uncertainty it walks a line of insanity and reality but it never goes either way until the very end the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight unfortunately unlike the usual suspects we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening whether it be true or false however this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent the game is told completely from its main character s point of view nicholas van orton michael douglas is a high strung and isolated businessman he lives alone in his giant mansion divorced from his wife elizabeth and is celebrating his th birthday the same age at which his father committed suicide at in the same mansion for his th birthday conrad sean penn the rebel of the family gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs consumer recreation services it will make your life fun again his brother promises as skeptical as nicholas is he is somewhat intrigued and annoyed by the lack of information something this businessman hates seeing a billboard in an office he decides to visit the mysterious company jim feingold james rebhorn greets nicholas and guides him through the sign up process which consists of psych tests physicals emotional responses and other mind games each game is suited to each person s emotional and psychological needs explains feingold one day nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company what he doesn t realize is that the game has already begun the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas way how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive the detail involved in fincher s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them with seven fincher had almost every single shot mean something he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to compared to seven though the game is light and comical because of this film s sense of humor and self awareness nothing can be taken quite seriously so don t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game because it doesn t want you to what does make sense is the final revelation when everything becomes apparent and clear if taken as it is the game s ending makes complete sense but if you try and critique every minute detail then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility perhaps that is the reason i docked the film while trying to remain realistic and plausible the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen we don t really care if douglas character lives or not because it isn t believable the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas douglas has played lonely businessmen before but here he adds another level to his performance his character who is normally level headed and relies on facts is forced to trust nobody can he believe the waitress he bumped into what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well and gives one of his best performances even better than his falling down persona the supporting cast is essential in this film and casting was critical sean penn is always good and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas brother deborah kara unger from crash is the waitress he bumps into and her performance is extremely good in fact she almost steals the film from douglas james rebhorn portrays his character very well and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas predicament another good performance comes from armin mueller stahl from shine as the book editor but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game he not only commands this cast but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life the game is rated r for language violence some gore and some nudity and drugs what is essential for this film to work is the writing john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue and some very funny moments this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects did however the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year s best films 
catherine deane jennifer lopez is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma but the boy s parents aren t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life as if trying to assure the boy s parents wasn t hard enough on her a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane s mental faculties a vicious serial killer named carl stargher vincent d onofrio has been kidnapping women locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life sized dolls just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia the police led by fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim s body but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state in a last ditch attempt they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell a cell which will completely fill with water in the next hours initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix while it does share some characteristics with both films particularly the first forty minutes which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm the buzz around this project is that first time feature film director tarsem singh who won many awards for his video of r e m s losing my religion wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story and a good portion of this film supports that theory despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments the cell does feature some remarkable imagery all of the sequences where we delve into someone s mind are incredibly beautiful including the dank mind of stargher whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h r giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe the first sequence that takes place in stargher s mind is by far the best featuring one of the most ingenious traps i ve ever seen in a film involving a horse which no one seeing this film will probably forget a zoo like display of stargher s victims which are animated like marionettes and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant but alas the sequences only become more silly as they go along despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images but at least vincent d onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance magnified by ten thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed in my opinion d onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful i e the newton boys feeling minnesota the thirteenth floor and the velocity of gary that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film as it contains heavy doses of both besides the nipple ring removal i mention above there is also stargher s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs prior to his catatonia and capture which will have audiences recoiling a sequence where catherine enters stargher s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit like device as a narrative film the cell is sorely lacking as a collection of images though the cell is extremely well done although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half singh has done what he supposedly set out to do make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together unfortunately a well written script should have been considered too because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv provided of course that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos 
harmless silly and fun comedy about dim witted wrestling fans gordie and sean david arquette and scott caan who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king oliver platt when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter joe pantoliano gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed but not fake mind you the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances which is exactly what a movie like this requires and oliver platt one of my favorite actors is a riot as the drunken washed up ex champion many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record but for me it just added to the silly factor of the film thereby increasing my enjoyment of it one casting complaint however rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer please if rose mcgowan is sexy then i m marilyn manson given the current state of the actual wcw if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming he d be the most popular guy they have on a similar note the plot line of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years although one does have to ask why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans director brian robbins you ll remember him as eric from tv s head of the class just knows how to make good dumb movies this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues and screenwriter steven brill the epic mighty ducks trilogy late last night manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me the only exceptions to that were a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan those moments made me cringe and or groan as an added bonus though the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll pg 
 the end of the affair is a dark and moody romantic period piece that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs although it s slow and sometimes confusing to follow it still manages to give audiences a moving experience based on graham greene s novel of the same name the film mainly follows characters there s maurice bendrix ralph fiennes who has an affair with henry mile s stephen rea wife sarah julianne moore sarah finds henry to be a bore because well he s just a normal guy it s all work and no play with him while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah and would do anything for her unfortunately the two break up this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks so that leads us to the present it s a few years later and they both still think of each other so maurice hires a private detective ian hart to see what sarah is up too while this may sound straight forward it s not it s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men unhappiness and the ever lasting love all this may sound like a drag but it really captures your interest with great performances by ralph fiennes doing another english patient type of film only this movie is better and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all films she did in i believe this was the role she had the most passion for and you can see why the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan even though i didn t read the book there s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive what s so moving about it you ask the tragedy of it all it s not the typical romance in which a guy finds a girl they fall in love and all is well this is more complicated and depressing it really shows the complexity of a relationship because nothing is ever perfect everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces back to neil jordan s script it wasn t only red roses there were times when i felt it too be a little slow but most romances are it also tended to be a bit confusing especially at the start it keep jumping around from past to present so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan i d have to say this is his finest achievement to date because quite frankly i ve never really found his work to be up to par it just never did anything for me until now when it ends it leaves viewers a little saddened but provoked nonetheless this is definitely one of the best films of and had some of the best acting most notably by moore not for all movie goers but for those who are film buffs and want something of value

thing rather than that there isn t in a little movie premiered at sundance this little film was called clerks and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation you really can t meet a person on this green earth who has not seen clerks it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming in kevin made another movie mallrats that flopped horribly thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in chasing amy came out and was kevin s biggest success to date now in we get a great little movie by the name of dogma wow what a cast ok here is the plot in this movie linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic one day at her house metatron the voice of god appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels matt damon and ben affleck from getting back into heaven by ways of a church ok now get this she is told to find two prophets one who talks a lot and one who doesn t however she gets jay and silent bob instead who give us great performances now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the th apostle falls out of the sky chris rock and helps guide her to find these angels salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way azrael jason lee who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win bethany linda fiorentino has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith what a movie it is everything rolled into one an offensive offbeat smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end and ends up being a feel good movie who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie of course the best and funniest of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob probably the best characters in movies that i like the star studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while the script was written by kevin smith with many f words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well with some classic lines linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay as well as silent bob alan rickman jason lee salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles being oscar winners for the classic good will hunting they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story the movie s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members dogma stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to clerks while being funny at times in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can t deny it dogma will offend people especially deeply religious people but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you all kevin smith fans must see 
there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure the culture and the brotherhood of white supremacy nice guy ed norton jr who sang in everyone says i love you plays derek a twenty year old skinhead dad s subtle racism grew large in derek after gang members killed his father dad was fighting a fire when they shot him now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence at a basketball court black and white tempers flare derek channels the aggression into a game black versus white for ownership of the courts when the choice presents itself derek goes for game point instead of the sucker punch cameron stacy keach steps in to derek s life as a surrogate father he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings keeping his own criminal record spotless he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high visibility racial intimidation derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race motivated mob crimes at the bottom of the chain derek s younger brother danny edward furlong made famous in terminator joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong one night three black youths break into derek s truck which is exactly what derek has been waiting for outside in his shorts and his tattoo he shoots them all the third would be thief unarmed is only wounded in the key scene of the film derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious enraptured awful stomp the fun spoiling nc of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate considering american history x was rated r what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal ecstatic violence the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief derek does not resist the cops and as they spin him around to cuff him the film slows down derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling sadistic satisfied grin now in prison derek faces new challenges as the black man in the laundry tells him in the joint you the nigra not me there is a clique of swastika wearing skinheads but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation derek finds himself truly alone truly in danger and truly afraid when derek finally gets out of prison he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed without derek s leadership they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he s screwed up in the end he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny the film ends a little too deliberately too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film but it barely detracts from the overall experience edward norton gives an oscar worthy performance although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction norton s performance compensated an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store he also captured the essence of an older brother he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously very lovingly both before and after his change of heart though clearly not for all tastes this film is bold and daring the subject matter is ugly cruel and at times hard to look at nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity s great face kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating if distasteful american subculture 
as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it the more pleased i was when i left first getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz if you liked scream you ll love wild things campbell gives a stunning performance this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days oh yeah the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me now onto more serious stuff and with this film i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way wild things has single handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa i m not saying that in a bad way but when you see this film you may be shocked by what you see however perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film s charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with an r rating being mormon i m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film trouble is i have already seen it and i like it wild things is a film noir of the s filled with s sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modern day taboos of s culture the style in which it is filmed is rich in color the actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film sure it s all too good to be true but ain t it fun to watch when movies like this come along sort of a better version of basic instinct there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it there will be people who don t want to admit liking what they see but i tell you most anyone who sees this will like it wild things begins at blue bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into it s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based on looks alone of course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared to the average person they are gorgeous immediately the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time we can turn off our brains right wrong while you may be expecting one thing to happen it certainly doesn t turn out that way the film begins in a classroom with nearly all the main characters present there s sam lombardo matt dillon a counselor for the students he s heading the class discussion there s also kelly van ryan denise richards a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam teaching the class however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubin vega who want to talk about sex cheers crimes boos what is a sex crime ray asks not gettin any one student responds this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch however upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands up and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body and so wild things sets into motion quickly kelly begins hitting on sam but sam doesn t want anything to do with her advances kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep surprisingly that s really all i can tell you about the plot any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists and what s more these plot twists are actually unpredictable going along the way of scream wild things maintains that film s surprises and then adds even more to them there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen and even though you think you may get tired of them the surprises are so genuine that it s rather pleasing going back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundaries of belief thankfully the convoluted plot doesn t give us much time to think about each one pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy well it is this is pretty much just one trashy film however it is the kind of trashy that isn t hard to watch it s good trash in a sense one the screenplay knows that it s not to be taken seriously and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story this varies everywhere from kelly s mother theresa russell who is more of a caricature of rich people all the way to an ambulance chasing lawyer bill murray who wears a neck brace to cover an insurance scam he is running bill murray also provides the best character in the film and most of the genuine laughs and two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed wild things is supposed to have sex in it what film with that title wouldn t and this movie breaks the boundaries instead of having heterosexual sex scenes it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell don t worry it s not as graphic as you might think the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon s full frontal nude scene it s very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it and for as long as i can remember i don t think i have seen an r rated film show an erect one before it s not completely but judging from the audiences reaction it was more than they expected too also during one scene late in the film there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon s characters but nothing came of it makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating or if the actors refused to do it what first made me want to see wild things was its cast neve campbell of course has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released here however she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead the closest role to this was her performance in the craft though even in that she was a nice girl campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent you can tell she will be around for a long time denise richards will also be around for a long time although she may be limited to the roles without much range here she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship troopers hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability and then there is daphne rubin vega a newcomer to the movies she gives a very good performance although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half towards the end she does get a bigger part on the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character but he makes the most of it you must have admiration though for what he did on screen and judging from many of the women s reactions in the theater to that shot they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right and then there is bill murray his performance is the comic relief and he nearly steals the film as a whole the entire cast works wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage a troi director john mcnaughton who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of a serial killer has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works his direction is smooth and stylish the visuals are striking filled with rich colors and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air however he seems more at home when the actors aren t talking his fly by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is a highlight the cinematography is gorgeous in its details its not often that you see a film like this and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures then there is the music this was probably the most obvious thing to me as it set the perfect mood for the film it s hard to describe in words so just see the film and listen to it it s wonderfully composed and presented and be sure to stick around during the closing credits mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use while most comedies use it for outtakes he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot but it s an entertaining way to finish the film plus there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality nudity language and violence again the nudity is rather unnecessary but let s face it people want to see it so why not give it to them neve campbell admirably has a no nudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off way to go neve the sex scenes are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hands one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating the language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo to your average everyday profanity and i can t stress it enough don t allow kids under to see this film the target age for the movie is the range and that s who should see it it s definitely not for those under did i mention that this film is rated r however for those that do get a chance to watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friends to see it the next time 
this remake of la cage aux folles features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son s future in laws the couple robin williams and nathan lane are about as archetypal or as the less kind might put it stereotypical gays possible williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode williams is excellent as should be no surprise gene hackman as right wing potential father in law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles the real star is lane his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight shooting uncle is hilarious perhaps it is a personal failing on my part but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it luckily for me at least it doesn t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men their son and the deception the question of stereotypes is a touchy one these guys personify the homophobic gay image you can almost hear the swishing if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world you ll be outraged but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals you ll love it your choice 
good films are hard to find these days great films are beyond rare proof of life russell crowe s one two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller is one of those rare gems a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting an intelligent script and masterful directing together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days genuine motivation in a story that rings true consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan s character in the film all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world i haven t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah s masterpiece the getaway but enough with the gossip let s get to the review the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman david morse an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti government soldiers upon discovering his identity the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for million the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off and no one will step forward with the money with no choice available to her bowman s wife alice ryan hires terry thorne crowe a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative to arrange the return of her husband but when things go wrong as they always do in these situations terry and his team which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year david caruso take matters into their own hands the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character driven vehicle filled with well written dialogue shades of motivation and convincing acting by all the actors the script is based on both a book the long march to freedom and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap ransom situations and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy screenwriter of the devil s advocate and dolores claiborne the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan but that between crowe and david caruso dug out from b movie hell caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe s right hand gun while providing most of the film s humor ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic gunslinger character of terry thorne the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes the bulk of those scenes which bookend the movie work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story s characters the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise director taylor hackford mixes both his old school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film proof of life is a thinking man s action movie it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war and the sacrifices one makes for those choices the sacrifices that help you sleep at night 
along his carreer mel gibson has collected several successes not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view for all that i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace a popular scotch hero of the th century where he would also perform the principal role accepting so huge challenge mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years with a suppoosed failure just to see recognized by everyone all his potentialities and that way to consolidate his position in hollywood it was definitely an enormous risk but i m sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face braveheart is in fact a magnificent and magisterial film for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative s rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest the william wallace s story is the story of so many others brave liberty s defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value along the centuries seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i king of england in a war by the autonomy of scotland as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone including the princess isabelle of wales wife of edward s son however william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty nowadays mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i the king longshank the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good sophie marceau as princess isabelle has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen as robert the bruce and of course mel gibson as william wallace however i think this time the mel gibson s work as director was much better than his work as actor the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes view by the camera of john toll then we realize all the beauty of this film braveheart is in my opinion one of the best movies of i ve heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean for now let s see if braveheart equalizes the oscars of lawrence of arabia it won t be easy it s gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson 
let s say you live at the end of an airport runway large jetliners continuously pass over your house rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace let s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home now let s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway and offers you more than it s worth wouldn t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed of course you would but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise and the house your castle that s what they are to darryl kerrigan michael caton and although he s happy that a multi national corporation would like to buy his home sorry it s not for sale unfortunately the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice not about to take this lying down darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto tiriel mora and makes a determined albeit pathetic attempt to fight back the castle an australian comedy by rob sitch is perhaps one of the simplest movies i ve seen in recent memory yet also one of the funniest in fact it is this film s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful the good guys and the bad guys are clear the humor is straightforward and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets it s the perfect setup for a relaxing hilarious good time and as much as i hate to admit it i liked the fact that i didn t have to think all that much while watching this film i just sat back and enjoyed myself the situation is one we ve seen before regular joe fights back against the government or big business or whatever what makes this film different is its characters darryl thinks he s got the best life in the world he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal anne tenny and he swells with pride when his son dale stephen curry digs a hole in the yard steve kerrigan anthony simcoe constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for investments like jousting sticks and overhead projectors while wayne kerrigan is in jail as a result of dennis denuto s incompetent courtroom maneuvers the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren t so stupid that they get annoying they re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing we look upon them with a little bit of pity but a whole lot of affection screenwriters sitch santo cilauro tom gleisner and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans sympathy for their situation the laughter they bring us and the family s wonderful characterization simple as it may be leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans but trust me it works i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs don t get me wrong slapstick when executed well can be genius it s just that too often a film will resort to it s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience not always successfully instead the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world when they are by themselves the are funny and when they are with normal people they are hilarious one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film s running time luckily it s a funny little detour that while slightly distracting from the film s main drive is still quite enjoyable with all the levity abound in the castle the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes i m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution of australia and certainly sounds impressive at any rate and for that matter it s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this 
felix sami bouajila the siege lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel pierre loup rajot in the little town of dieppe in northern france when he is laid off from his job after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born he decides to journey to marseilles in the south to find the man he never met in the adventures of felix writers directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy jeanne and the perfect guy embracing that typically american genre their second effort the adventures of felix once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself felix is happy with his life in dieppe but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel he is out of a job and at loose ends when he goes through his late mother s papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles hundreds of miles away felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south puts together a supply of cocktails for his hiv virus kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny along the way a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations on the road he witnesses a race related mugging that turns into murder and frightened for his own safety runs away without telling the police following this harrowing experience he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family his journey brings him to rouen and the film s first title section my little brother where he meets jules a young art student who becomes smitten with felix they steal a car and develop a chaste brotherly affection before felix must move on he next meets elderly mathilde patachou in the chapter titled my grandmother and soon learns that she too has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to she wants him to stay with her but he must continue on his way to find his father in the weakest chapter of felix s road trip titled my cousin he meets a railroad worker philippe garziano and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off once again toward marseilles he next helps a stranded lady motorist isabelle ariane ascaride and shags a ride with her and her three kids each with a different daddy in the sequence titled my sister he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would on the final leg of the journey titled my father he meets an older man a fisherman maurice benichou who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix s kite just like a father and son the adventures of felix has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix he is a likable guy fighting his hiv with his doses of cocktails and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk often with dance and song to find his father and himself as he encounters each member of his new family promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen the cast of characters making up felix s new found family are nearly as charming as the star each in their own way patachou especially is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix ariane ascaride along with her kids gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had only the cousin chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix s family the adventures of felix does not reinvent the road movie but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man s journey to find himself and to his surprise his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot delpech s crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside i give it a b

clint eastwood in his ripe old age is cashing one talent in for another midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood directed film clint isn t even in and it s damn good adapted from a best selling john berendt novel based on true events this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head and that s just the mayor as director and producer eastwood contributes a self indulgent but very competent minutes neatly balancing drama suspense and humor like all great movies midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves and not from some contrived juvenile intrusion the acting from big time stars john cusack and kevin spacey is as good as you d expect but it s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm cusack plays a free lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey s parties lots of food beverages and gunplay yes an employee of spacey s has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead it seems like a simple matter of self defense the guy threatened spacey shot at him missed then spacey took him out but being a movie there s much more to it than that and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in the weird circle of entertainment this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in there s the requisite sexy woman alison nepotist s daughter eastwood the strange piano player the voodoo woman and the transvestite miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his her own as the stealer of every scene she appears in what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony chablis playing herself is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul but never seems exploited as the movie s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey s lawyer both help immensely as does having the fly guy as the jury s foreman it s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey s homosexuality yes spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man before he shot him of course midnight in the garden of good and evil isn t a classic but it is one of the better celebrity directed true story best seller adaptations out there likewise no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations but the performances are all great in fact i d almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category serving america for more than th of a century 
plot odin is a great high school basketball player he s dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass in fact the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him unfortunately the coach s real son hugo isn t too pleased to hear that in fact he doesn t like hearing about any of odin s triumphs as they generally supersede his own so what does he set out to do well let s just say that he starts to mess with people s heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to well you ll see critique a very powerful thoroughly depressing well acted non teen movie starring a bunch of teens credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic set in a realistic high school environment with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film who turn over some very convincing performances taking you through all of their characters ups and downs hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of sign of a good actor if you ask me phifer also comes to play in this movie with a nice blend of charisma fear love and anger spread over his character i was always on this guy s side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along julia stiles was also good but her character wasn t much different from others that she s played recently i was however very surprised with martin sheen s showing since i hadn t taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years his character is definitely over the top in this film but i appreciated his fervor his rage his ultimate and blind desire to win above all a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest i did have a few reservations about the movie though first of all what was with all of the gangsta hip hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition it was cute at first but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times the film was also edited pretty choppily like some scenes were cut out and no one cleaned it up afterwards i also didn t like the fact that hartnett s character the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film was infallible in other words pretty much everything he says or asks of someone happens automatically and without any goofups i mean i know the guy is smart and all but i would have appreciated a little more realism under some of the circumstances but overall the movie will devastate you it s not a fun date movie it s not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks it s about jealousy love envy fury passion revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that s ever passed through your head is it worth seeing oh most definitely pun intended it s a moving picture with great performances no shakespearian speak thank you god and an outstanding directorial job by nelson the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine and i was especially impressed with the director s choice of music near the end in fact the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver and i guess that s saying something right there where s joblo coming from things i hate about you election hamlet love s labor s lost natural born killers save the last dance shakespeare in love 
with many big budget science fiction films great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts cheesy plot twists and terrible acting the fifth element the abyss and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting writing or both at first glance the matrix larry andy wachowski s sci fi kung fu shoot em up spectacular looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high concept bad movies especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue the matrix works it s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films most obviously the terminator films star wars and total recall but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout reeves plays neo a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with trinity carrie anne moss a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks a unseen omniscient cult figure known as morpheus lawrence fishburne and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems moreover he discovers that the grim bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah with grave doubts that he is actually the one prophesized to come and save the world reluctant or not what follows is a mix of hong kong style slow motion shootouts surreal dream sequences high speed chases and comic book kung fu fights the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion unfortunately the matrix doesn t provide many answers to the questions it raises but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions shoot outs and flying roundhouse kicks perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving who plays agent smith the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix weaving s stony appearance deadpan voice and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting evil technological force that controls the matrix like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t terminator in terminator judgement day weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because despite his power and seeming invincibility he looks ordinary even scrawny weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography it seems to be deliberately kitchy with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors in a few scenes the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring however with the comic book style and tone of the film you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience the matrix isn t a classic its open ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero the kind of shmaltzy feel good goo that most of the film avoids reportedly the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel unfortunately audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future the matrix is an fun enjoyable diversion like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival just don t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry 
jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box sets on the video shelves he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well off maybe it s a classic case of displacement it s easier to see jarvis own lyrics obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall as a fetishization of lowlife rather than leigh s films but it s worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working class characters don t make for a guarantee of authenticity let alone a good film it s the triumph of secrets lies then that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek authenticity and honesty in everyday lives following her adopted mother s funeral hortense a young black optometrist sets out to find her birth mother and is disturbed to find out that she is white it is cynthia a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne cynthia s younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages largely because of his wife s animosity towards her hortense calls up cynthia who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party which maurice is hosting secrets lies has a simple enough theme at its heart as one character puts it best to tell the truth isn t it that way nobody gets hurt but if the film delivers much more than a trite message it s because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us hence cynthia s difficulty with acknowledging first to herself then to others that hortense is her daughter one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever been with a black man before a long suppressed memory seizes her at the party cynthia s pretense that hortense is her factory co worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies as agonizing as they are funny little lies seep into every corner like maurice pretending that he s just dropping by when he visits cynthia after much deliberation maurice s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme a sad looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face she says she needs the photo to look as bad as possible to collect insurance money yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars there are occasionally hilarious moments as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception i ve got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne if you ve got it flaunt it is what i say as played by brenda blethyn cynthia comes close to being a caricature with her nervous somewhat disconnected way of talking but she s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her precisely because she s so needy of love perhaps indeed the whole cast gives warmly rounded detailed performances the script was developed partly through improvisations and the fusion of cast script and director shows best in the party scene seemingly everyone is talking at the same time and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout in a very different way but also using a long single shot the scene of hortense and cynthia s first meeting in a lonely caf a achieves a touching intensity all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings the film s climax with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen esque revelations and everybody hugging each other is the one thing that seems false about this film however it s a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character s lives when cynthia says near the end this is the life innit you get the sense that following the cynicism of his last film naked leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all without comforting illusions the flying inkpot s rating system wait for the video a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton but they just don t get the good grades so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide the remaining roommates will get an automatic chris michael vartan and tim matthew lillard are two guys who really want the to get into harvard how far will they go to get their chris and tim are also roommates with rand played by randall batinkoff the two scheme to murder rand make it look like a suicide so they can supposedly get their they have heard this rumor many places and they are willing to take the chance to find out rand is a very very mean person he treats his girlfriend natalie played by tamara craig thomas like she doesn t matter at all she is very afraid of him and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant she does tell him and he becomes enraged that night would be the last night of rand s life tim and chris give rand a bottle of rat poison making him think that it is beer rand drinks down the poison and then dies now tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself it does not take long until the suicide note is found but the body isn t found the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information feeling extreme guilt chris is having a very hard time especially with his girlfriend emma played by keri russell she wants to know more but he will not even speak with her will he give in will tim turn chris in will chris turn tim in will they turn themselves in all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film the events in the curve are very surprising original and fun the plot sounds much like dead man on campus but that is not the deal with this film this film is a very serious one with not many laughs there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying it is a terrific suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride the sound really stood out in the film it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film the way the movie is filmed is also great all of the technical aspects as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done the performances in the curve are very good matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role just like in s scream a he is very strange in this film as well i like him in this sort of role rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she s all that michael vartan is fantastic as chris who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed where he co starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student keri russell also gives a great performance she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film tamara craig thomas is also realistic especially coping with the death of her boyfriend some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case the bottom line i might just have to curve that a into an a note the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early it was decided the film would not be released widely it is now available at blockbuster video only and for rent only see you at the video store 
plot a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention the boys eventually get together to split the money but as plans change double crosses occur dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road who s on the up and up who s the real bad guy and who s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie critique the funnest movie that i ve seen so far this year it s got style it s got tough guys talkin shite and it s got plenty of bullets to go around a definite hunk a hunk a burnin adventure a guy s guy movie through and through and one that ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff it s not very original it goes on for a little too long but costner and russell make it happen as two shite kickin elvis lovers who don t stop till they more or less drop this movie s got some pretty intensive shoot out scenes one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i ve ever witnessed featuring several elvises with guns a blazin and the king s music playing in the background and a decent helping of double crosses sharp dialogue and funny moments in fact even though the cast is filled with many name actors b actors as they might be for the most part most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim but the true glue that holds this film together other than the spirit of elvis himself is costner and russell who play their badass characters to the t sure russell s been down this road before but costner surprised me with his nastiness i guess he s pissed at all the box office bombs that he s been in of late but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here in the end the bottom line with this movie is having fun kickin ass and making sure there s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards and smoke em if you got em folks there is also this one really great show down scene between costner and a cop that ll have you crackin up and lovin it all at the same time the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background with plenty and i mean plenty of camera tricks cuts and edits but for this kind of flick it actually works the film is not perfect though it starts off with a pretty big bang but then pulls a way of the gun on us and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle while characters intermingle and disperse i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega hot in the movie no okay well i just did i coulda done without her whole romance angle but to be honest it doesn t take up much of the film which is generally covered in blood explosions guts and elvis nods try to see how many inside connections to the king you can guess of course it s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind i also like these types of guy movies a lot and even though the film doesn t bring much originality to the table it does offer a pretty coherent story some nice twists and turns humor and a big ol helping of whoop ass coming straight from costner and russell s respective boots probably not a film for everyone but definitely for those who enjoy the guns the charismatic bad guys and a fun if entirely disposable adventure now see how many elvis songs i ve used to pun my way through this phony review below the elvis songs also recommend this movie so whether you re lonesome tonight or any other night remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets leave your little sister at home bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse cause this movie ain t one to return to the sender i really beg of you whether you re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender and no suspicious minds either folks cause i got stung by this movie i mean it really shook me up and unless you re the devil in disguise himself i think you won t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either so don t be cruel don t turn away don t curl up with your latest flame tonite whether she be a hard headed woman or not and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film it s now or never folks trust me i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i d seen so far this year is far behind me joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building thank you thank you very much where s joblo coming from get carter heat honeymoon in vegas payback reindeer games reservoir dogs way of the gun 
jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities but whom you end up liking anyway in as good as it gets the character in question is melvin udall a successful novelist with obsessive compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you know where he s mean i mean really mean the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium every day melvin eats at the same cafe sits at the same table and gets served by the same waitress you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance when his waitress carol helen hunt tells him he can just go sit in another section and all the other waitresses just cringe one day melvin makes a comment that goes to far and carol genuinely hurt comes down on him like a ton of bricks at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course but is also the only person who can get to him too another person who often crosses melvin s sights is simon greg kinnear an artist who lives on melvin s floor aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city simon has the added benefit of being gay making him a prime target simon s friend frank cuba gooding jr also gay does not fare much better when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital and frank who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor intimidates melvin into watching after simon s dog while he convalesces this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in melvin gets to like the dog and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin s softening up to the world around him it doesn t happen overnight but throughout the film he bites his tongue here cares a little there and most miraculously falls in love one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others he s traveling terra incognita here and it shows good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film especially by nicholson and hunt they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen greg kinnear who is becoming known for his supporting film roles is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels cuba gooding jr performs with a hyped up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear and comes through with a near constant comic performance the screenplay by mark andrus and james l brooks is clever touching and funny the best part about it however is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting melvin is a man we can t quite figure out but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention carol is a working woman living with her mother trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers but who is still not accepted by much of society combined with the talent of the actors these characters make the film the one noticeable area where the film is lacking however is the absence of cuba gooding jr through the second half his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary but the film ends before his return leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general in addition to a part in the film s conclusion there s one actor who will probably not be recognized by any awards but who contributes greatly to many of the movie s best scenes and who deserves mention this is that little dog he plays such a pivotal role to melvin s character development actually serves to forward the plot and has some absolutely scene stealing moments that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal award or no however when even the dog puts in a good performance you know you ve got an outstanding movie 
if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie from dusk till dawn would probably be it scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez desperado the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence and is incredibly fun to watch it starts off as a pulp fiction type crime story with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store because this is a tarantino movie however it s not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot it s a case of a hole being shot through someone s hand a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie everything overdone and nothing as it seems clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex preacher and juliette lewis his daughter whom registered sex pervert tarantino eyes endlessly you know you re mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive although she s not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border clooney s strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet it does its trick the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind never noticing clooney or tarantino once they get to mexico it s time to wait at the rendezvous point a topless bar called titty twister where we re once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper finally after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him the stripper turns into a vampire soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back that s right we ve come all this way to see a vampire movie but like everything else tarantino takes this age old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over the top entertainment so we get holy water condom balloons heads rolling quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes a lap dog of satan the from dusk till dawn dialogue is tarantino hovering between absurd and disgusting as when they re entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister but always entertaining and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second rate gorefest clooney keitel and especially tarantino are so over the top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people even if there s absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment from dusk till dawn isn t the classic of modern cinema that pf is but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie

in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies payback was better than conspiracy theory but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon in other words it s a decent couple of hours of entertainment but years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson s greatest hits payback probably won t be on it gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll mel s partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt so he puts a couple of bullets in mel leaving him for dead and goes on to pay off his creditors but mel isn t dead it would be a real short movie if he was and he certainly isn t happy to make matters worse he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters so mel goes after the mob to get it back payback is often a very violent film to its credit there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic but the director i m not sure which one more about that in a second made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films the film appears a bit disjointed in places which is understandable considering producer star gibson wasn t thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re shot when the director refused another one was brought in to do the re shoot so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end it s always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain unless that person has some redeeming qualities in this case gibson s character has few redeeming qualities but hey its mel so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role the audience would not be quite as responsive gibson is gibson whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer he does a good job he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast including maria bello as his love interest william devane and kris kristofferson as mod bosses the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn t have a real big part is james coburn as yet another mobster if i had one big disappointment in this film it would be that coburn didn t have a bigger role in the end payback is a fairly solid action thriller just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson s other work 
being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it shall we dance won t be seen by that many people and that s a shame this is a funny enchanting and goofy movie full of laughs surprises and wonderful dance sequences the surprising thing about shall we dance is the universal appeal of the story a us version is in the works and it s no wonder it s not really all that culture specific although there is a narrated set up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isn t at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film the only important unexplained japanese specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that yen is roughly when you see the film and you should see this film you ll know why a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life a house a child and good marriage still doesn t translate into a fulfilled life after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work sugiyana koji yakusho decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai tamiyo kusakari too rich for his blood sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her we then meet the players in this gem of a movie who all have their own reasons for joining the class later on we meet aoki at the dance studio naoto takenaka a co worker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film the story laughs and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along it s a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances it s difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters and in the end each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater it s one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore no big plot no special effects no gunplay no tragic consequences no forced examinations of the nature of love and no insights into the nature of evil just a warm funny endearing film that will charm the pants off of you when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside shall we dance will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste 
it s hard not to recommend the others the supernatural thriller written and directed by alejandro amen bar open your eyes adroitly establishes and maintains a low key atmosphere of menace the cinematography by javier aguirresarobe is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied overall the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old twilight zone episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented only to learn they are actually a child s toy a military test subject or a department store dummy watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter i always wanted to shout get on with it as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in the others my reaction was much the same set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii the story focuses on grace kidman who tends to her children anne alakina mann and nicholas james bentley and worries about her husband charles christopher eccleston a missing serviceman anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all doors protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time at the beginning of the film three servants mrs mills fionnula flanagan young mute lydia elaine cassidy and mr tuttle eric sykes an aging gardener join the family the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not to make matters worse the children are upset nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them that s essentially the whole story with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear earlier there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog the visuals in the otherworldly sequence courtesy of aguirresarobe are simply astounding i also enjoyed the presence of religion a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural grace is a christian and answers her children s questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper when mother is away though the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore just as real children do but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending the others sets out to be a classic ghost story but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist 
the last steve martin film i saw the spanish prisoner was a very different approach for the comic actor as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob a process from a clueless businessman martin s character did it all for money in his most recent movie bowfinger martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name that will make him more popular at the parties and most importantly that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door playing the title role martin is once again the good guy the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie this con man is very likeable for some reason even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner maybe the message is that in hollywood to win over the trust and friendship of others you have to be a little evil bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars martin who also wrote the screenplay is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best peter sellers in two different but equally hilarious roles one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy burger king employee brother the story follows aging and failing director producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b action movie called chubby rain in order to attract actors and crew members bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it but this won t stop the aggressive bowfinger he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage will bowfinger be able to make his film or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on bowfinger is a very cartoon like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about it is always funny to see actors directors producers making fun of themselves or co workers especially in a playful movie such as this besides the very repetitive and superflous ending bowfinger is a joy to watch if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures the movie is great fun 
contrary to the title the boxer is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics it s actually three movies in one a political film a boxing film and a love story all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal we ve seen it all before and we re just not blown away with it like we should be oh well it s still an excellent irish story the boxer of the title is danny flynn jim sheridan staple daniel day lewis an ex ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after years and finds out that his troubles are far from over first off the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill brian cox and one of its sub leaders harry gerard mcsorley both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail while this is going on danny and his old drunkard buddie ike ken stott who played the chief inspector in danny boyle s shallow grave re open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects protestant and catholics to work together danny not only begins teaching kids how to box but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison and is ready to start boxing real people again and danny runs into his ex love maggie breaking the waves s emily watson who hasn t seen him since he went in they don t easily start up their romance again because she s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny s tenure in prison and also has a son liam ciaran fitzgerald from him whom liam is hoping will get out soon but the two are slowly re drawn to eachother again and this begins to complicate things the political story is nothing really special but works in itself we ve seen it many a time before but it s at least interesting sometimes emotional and even riveting at times there s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty the boxing story is very minor to the story but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly and even with good sportsmanship there are only a few boxing scenes but they re never like raging bull let s strip down the sport to its bones brilliant they re more realistic and instead of bone crunching we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother which is slightly unerving at times and i didn t know daniel day lewis was in such good shape but the backbone of the story is the love one because these characters are given such horrible circumstances and since the two leads have such great chemistry together we really feel for their plight as the film goes on and circumstances get worse and worse the characters have to make real human decisions and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters this is how you write a love story take note hollywood these elements are pretty much equally balanced with each of the parts of the stories working hand in hand with eachother i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered and sometimes spilled over into the next it made sure that we didn t just care for one of them i m not saying they re all equally great because the love story really carries the film but at least they all work out respectively the acting is amazing with day lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry i m not sure if they re oscar nominee bound but they re very good in the supporting roles billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike who is just a great scene stealer the direction and co writing by jim sheridan with the other co writing credit going to terry george is excellent rounding out the characters well but not pacing everything greatly i noticed that the first half was very leisurely yet fascinating but the second half whirls by at a quick pace and ends much too quickly more time could have been spent thinking up the ending since it does seem quite sloppy though the boxer is a good film it never achieves the greatness that it should sure it s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get but on it s own it just could have been better but it still works out gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama and features great acting even if it could have been better this ll do 
for a movie about disco era excess comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late s and early s manhattan dance club think of it as a sort of boogie nights lite where that similarly structured and set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift leaves the kinkier details to your imagination it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter but it thankfully never resorts to preaching either in fact were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment would be about as feathery as the time period s popular female hairstyle studio was a haven for the rich famous and generally good looking before it closed its doors forever in inside anything went and we are told everything did the film s fictional main character is shane o shea ryan phillippe the jerky jock from i know what you did last summer a fresh faced year old who dreams of venturing beyond the club s velvet rope and coming face to face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines his wish comes true when studio owner steve rubell mike myers spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in and permits him passage but not before he doffs his hideous shirt of course once inside shane becomes seduced by the club s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs he has such a good time that he doesn t want to leave so he seeks employment as a busboy he quickly becomes friends with greg breckin meyer and anita salma hayek a married couple who work along side of him greg s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio bartender while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own after rubbing elbows among other things with a renowned socialite sela ward and gaining the personal interest of rubell shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of but fame doesn t come without a price s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players at a slim hour and a half the film is too short to take on such a multi character focus and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act alleged last minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction since sometimes feels like it s missing a scene here or there nowhere is this more apparent than in shane s relationship with soap opera actress julie black neve campbell a frequent studio patron whom he s long admired from afar the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special that works despite these limitations then is largely due to the competence and energy with which it s assembled sure it s shallow slick sanitized portrait of a bygone age and sure we ve seen the rags to riches story gazillions of times but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision the film boasts some fine comic creativity the pinnacle of which is disco dottie the wedding singer s ellen dow an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public but slides up to shane behind s closed doors and asks for a funky little treat the solid sexy cast smooths out if only while you re caught up in the film any rough spots belonging to their alter egos or the plot newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat he and campbell as fetching as ever look so good together it s a shame their subplot goes nowhere meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in clueless he was the stoner with the joker smile while hayek simply sizzles especially when leading a dance class with the mantra one two three attitude sherry stringfield unidentifiable under big s hair takes on her first big screen gig since she left er as rubell s accountant but she s criminally underused as the droopy eyed drug addled steve rubell myers is worth the price of admission alone when he s not playing the life of the party the ex saturday night live comedian strips away all of rubell s confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty unhappy life with exorbitance it s a moment worthy of pity when while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening he attempts to seduce one of his employees and while his performance is largely serious myers mixes the empathy with a delicate austin powers esque wink thus keeping consistent with s overall feel gaudy larger than life and satisfyingly ornamental not unlike a giant disco ball 
 remember what the mpaa says horrific and deplorable violence is ok as long as you don t say any naughty words featuring the voice talents of matt stone trey parker mary kay bergman rated r filmmakers jump on real life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up and already someone s made a movie about it and it s not thank god a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy instead we get a sharp biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed based on a popular and controversial cable tv show south park bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r rated movie and learn some naughty words when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms they decide to blame canada wage war against the neighbor country and execute terrence and phillip the flatulent actors in the obscene film the kids form an alliance they name la resistance with the accent on the third syllable of resistance to save their favorite thespians in a hilarious spoof of tribute to les mis rables in a subplot one of the characters kenny who else dies and goes to hell where he meets satan satan and saddam hussein are lovers you see satan is a benevolent soul while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex apparently too if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth aside from being a brilliant satire south park is also an all stops out musical with unforgettable numbers like shut your f ing face uncle f er and cartman s mom is a big fat bitch almost invariably it s funny stuff often juvenile but always funny the same can be said for the rest of the movie it s intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner i e toilet humor endless profanity etc not that there s anything wrong with that vulgarity when done right is my bag baby trey parker and matt stone the twenty somethings behind the film and the show paint a bulls eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa s rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren t uttered the auteurs throw some nasty one liner insults their way the ratings a plenty association isn t the only target of this unsparing banter people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game with the blame canada plot being a not so cheap shot at them the distinctively low tech cardboard animation is oddly effective even more so than the state of the art deep canvas technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan it s more pleasant to look at less intimidating up on the screen and most importantly it doesn t detract from the film s concept as much as disney s admirably awe inspiring work does the show s popularity has been waning as of late and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings perhaps not having seen the show on numerous occasions i can say that it s not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years parker and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask must the show go on eugene novikov 
there s a thin line between satire and controversy and mike nichols the birdcage wolf has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election based on the book written by anonymous actually former newsweek writer joe klein john travolta plays governor jack stanton but he doesn t actually play stanton he plays bill clinton just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville although the credits will of course say otherwise the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton adrian lester a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations and whether it be keeping the history of his boss pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers richard jemmons billy bob thorton and daisy green maura tierney team up with henry as the would be president s advisors and hire lesbian veteran libby holden kathy bates as the campaign s eccentric tougher than dirt incriminator together they face all sorts of sexual allegations the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race in its satire and controversy primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it s characters letting us understand what they want and why and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look and the rest of the cast also make superb performances adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden at occasions you can t help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste there are long slabs of time where john travolta unquestionably the most interesting to watch is missed from the screen and since it is awkwardly structured as henry s story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot or even the point of the film having said that make no mistake primary colors is always enjoyable to watch but frequently we have to ask ourselves exactly what are we watching most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary and almost unsuitable to the rest of the film but as i mentioned before there is a thin line between satire and controversy and for the most part primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far from overpowering look at winning the public s opinion although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is thankfully it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it s scary 
october sky is a rare oddity in cinema a self proclaimed uplifting film that is actually uplifting based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam rocket boys october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream it s and for the boys of coalwood west virginia there s not much hope of a rosy future coalwood is a coal mining town and except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship most of coalwood s boys are destined to work in the mine but in october an event happens that sparks one boy to dream the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam jake gyllenhaal to dream a future of rocketry and space travel of course homer s parents chris cooper and natalie canderday aren t quite sure what to make of their son s unusual interests homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley laura dern a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair and so with stars in his eyes and thoughts of scholarships in his head homer enlists the help of three other boys william lee scott chad lindberg and chris owen and begins to build a rocket but do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched however miraculously october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls making the exact right moves at the exact right times a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film from the outset of the film he is immediately likable and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience unfortunately while october sky focuses on homer the other three kids get the short end of the stick they remain little more than placeholders reading insert friend here of the adults in the film chris cooper is the most fully realized character the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child s dreams but instead shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town but is too stubborn to realize what that is director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge however there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial however these lapses are minimal and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course the problem with many so called uplifting films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat october sky never resorts to that level and yet manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits 
when i saw the trailer for the sixth sense i didn t expect much from it my snap judgment was that it was a watered down version of the shining or possibly a late entry in the glut of angel related movies tv shows of a couple years ago but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe at the beginning of the movie he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work but he is soon confronted by vincent a patient malcolm failed years earlier donnie wahlberg former new kid in an impressive cameo a year passes and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed cole sear haley joel osment is a withdrawn kid who is called freak by the other boys in the neighborhood weird things seem to happen around cole his mother olivia williams leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn t moved and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn t for example that there was once a gallows in his school he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom the trailer gave away the movie s first major plot twist if it hadn t the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn t know what s wrong with cole if you re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer stop reading this review right now and go see the sixth sense anyway since the trailer gave it away i figure it s fair game to discuss here once malcolm gains cole s trust cole reveals his secret he sees ghosts everywhere dead people wander around not knowing that they re dead invisible to everyone except cole malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth the box office success of the sixth sense has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that s so i hate to burst anybody s bubble but the sixth sense isn t really a horror film at its core the sixth sense is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally scarred adult help each other to move past their problems some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy though one that really got to me the ghost of a boy says to cole i ll show you where my dad keeps his gun when the ghost turns we see the bullet wound in the back of his head osment gives the best performance i ve ever seen from a child actor it s hard enough to find a grown up in hollywood who can give a subtle realistic portrayal although willis gets top billing cole is really the protagonist of the story and osment truly brings the complex kid to life if only willis work were as impressive accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm his most challenging role to date this is a bad omen for his next movie the story of us which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage writer director m night shyamalan has a light poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite he s also a skillful storyteller as the movie s ending demonstrates only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole bottom line osment should get an oscar nomination and you should go see this movie 
of circumcision psychic wounds and the family sitcom the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film there s a guy s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women as his imagination plays o n he and we picture these motley characters in a mix and match shuffle of unlikely marriages businesswomen with bums matrons with paint salesmen the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy it s not just a witty funny summing up of the film s themes you might not guess it yet but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction gets taken on a road trip put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom and the general idea of the film doesn t at first seem so wildly distant from standard issue hollywood comedy man who was adopted as a child ben still er sets out on a journey to meet his real parents along with his wife patricia arquette his baby and a pretty psychology researcher tea leoni in tow various mix ups shenanigans oddball characters and yup disasters follow but if you think you ve been here before the dialogue and the direction by david o russell who made spanking the monkey take it into another dimension the dreaded t name seems an inevitable reference point what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance but really the point is that the foot massage master hasn t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast funny irreverent lines or on the absurdities of ordinary speech whether it s about circumcision psychic wounds oral sex carjacking the beauties of the armpit area or ronald reagan the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention the best thing is how these words aren t just there for the punchlines but are great precisely because they re said in character like tea leoni s neurotically charged psychobabbler who s able to say under assault it s understandable if you find this threatening the cast is excellent throughout and rather than singling out anybody kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission there are some elements of a woody allen film in this not to mention the hand held camera and loose improvisational feel of some scenes like allen russell s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children and everybody really still if you re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la murphy brown frasier fill in the blank american comedy well it won t happen the film sets up expectations like these with the lead character s search f or his origins and his hopes of self healing only to knock them down if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one ness flirting with disaster s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go and that the film suggests is the essential family state and you better learn to love it somehow this is perversely feelgood cinema right up to its manic end 
while it was part of former yugoslavia my country croatia used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general words croatia and croatians were unheard even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations the rare exception was the dogs of war adaptation of frederick forsyth s bestselling novel yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people probably terrorists who happen to remove parts of arm dealers stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business politics and crime the movie protagonist shannon christopher walken is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away after being arrested and tortured by kimba s secret police shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north colin blakely upon return he is approached by mining company again but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d etat against kimba shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies especially those made in s is its authenticity almost close to documentary it shouldn t surprise anyone because the author of the novel frederick forsyth made reputation by blending fiction with real life thus creating interesting exciting yet very believable plots for his books those plots were also responsible for few very successful s thrillers and one of them zinnemman s the day of the jackal is now considered a classic in that genre this one deals with soldiers of fortune ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of s and s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires unlike wild geese that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure script by george malko and gary de vore author whose death last year became real life mystery is serious and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work the movie doesn t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda christopher walken played in many movies yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role his performance in this film perhaps isn t breathtaking yet adequate his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned world weary man whose alienation from the normal way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends although the movie doesn t lack capable actors their roles are miniature compared with walken s and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character however those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war tom berenger paul freeman jo beth williams victoria tennant in brief cameo and biggest surprise is ed o neill of married with children fame as shannon s reluctant colleague this was the first major production for john irvin and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable yet second class director with the good script he can make very good movie with the bad script he can make real mess luckily the dogs of war had a good script irvin s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon used on the wrong places in the final battle scene where we can see mercenaries at work irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics unlike s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes unfortunately by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn t help but despite those shortcomings this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty realistic political drama 
you ve got to love disney no matter what they serve up it is a guaranteed success as long as it s animated kids have to go see the movie then they have to get the toys oh the video came out got to buy it or risk little billy s temper tantrums for the next month all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca a visit to the magic kingdom stay at the disneyland hotel buy a disney t shirt eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick it s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it dale carnegie should have had it so good what s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality you see disney animated features these days have two components theme and plot the theme changes with each new movie the plot does not the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same however while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box office receipts merchandising dollars and glimmers in the eyes of little children critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer luckily disney s latest animated offering mulan manages to be engaging and refreshing even while rife with formula the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns led by the imposing shan yu miguel ferrer soon china s emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china s defense when the fa family is served notice it is the elderly father fa zhou soon tek oh who must answer the call as there are no other males in the household fearing her father will surely be killed in battle fa mulan ming na wen disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army mulan based on a chinese epic poem is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman s role and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband we see that grace is not one of her strong points very early on we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one s family and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker mulan fails at that task by leaving home to fight in her father s place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too as is the case with most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film i m not sure if they will get much airplay but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time both lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain of mulan s army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salonga s voice translates much better to animation you have to hear it to understand interestingly the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan there is no significantly big number which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie it is however an expectation which has been built by disney s own formulaic history and some viewers may feel as if something is missing artistically the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works it helps to contribute a more authentic and therefore more credible nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically disneyfied ethnic tale there are also a couple of visually standout scenes one involving the charge of shan yu s hun army which utilizes the same computer enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it when mulan resolves to take her father s place she dons her father s old battle armor and unsheathes a sword as she does so you can see her reflection in the polished metal it just left me thinking that was really cool a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film varying from the straight such as soon tek oh as fa zhou to the comical such as harvey fierstein as yao a gruff pugilistic member of shang s conscripted army even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance i found the choice of b d wong as shang a little strange you may remember him as martin short s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast so i guess anything s possible in any event wong performs admirably as well one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people june foray who supplies grandmother fa s speaking voice is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale as in boris and natasha marni nixon who provides grandmother fa s singing voice is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i maria in west side story and eliza in my fair lady with this in mind hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films in an effort to be culturally sensitive and to avoid a miss saigon type debacle disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian american actors for both lead and supporting roles in addition to the actors already mentioned the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong gedde watanabe james shigeta and george takei i guess clyde kusatsu wasn t available at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and happily adults this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next rather than hope that the next one is better 
it s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts but that s just what happened to me at uhf weird al yankovic s big screen debut uhf is a television parody a la airplane and like airplane the movie is extraordinarily stupid but it s dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb it s so silly and outrageous it s hilarious the movie stars weird al as george newman a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination the type who fantasizes he s indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns george is basically a loser his daydreams and smart alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station george revives channel with innovative programming shows like wheel of fish and movies like conan the librarian as the station s ratings rise it comes into competition with channel the leading vhf network affiliate as r j fletcher channel s ill natured hard nosed owner veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy he really hams it up with his snorts grimaces and scowls uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television including game shows tabloid talk shows children s shows dizzy news women and movies everything from rambo to close encounters the funniest scene the one that made my head spin is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed like most movies in its genre uhf is hit or miss for every gag that works at least one fizzles for instance weird al s mock video of money for nothing by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt although it does have some nifty computer animation but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail we know another gut wrencher is on the way in fact uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane type movie since well since airplane much of the credit goes to weird al s exceptionally inventive script and to the movie s winsome cast weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning but because he s not afraid to look silly he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character the real standout is michael richards as stanley the dim witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children s show stanley spadowski s playhouse stanley s off beat mixed up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over night star he is an endearing mixture of good natured innocence high energy enthusiasm and puppy dog cuteness and above all he s a good janitor who adores his work another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips the cast also features gedde watanabe the chinese foreign exchange student in sixteen candles as the karate master who hosts the hit series wheel of fish also aboard for the ride is fran drescher who plays pamela finklestein channel s roving reporter unfortunately as weird al s girlfriend victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering whining and sulking her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether while uhf is not an absolute must see it s definitely the ticket if you re looking for a wild and zany whacked out comedy the movie is good enough to see in the theaters but it may work even better on television the very medium at which it pokes fun 
did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward with a comatose sunny von bulow she is the main narrator of the film in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder the dramatic trick works as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder sex unhappiness and a lawyer s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win jeremy irons is claus von bulow in what is his finest role and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history he is as hated as any man alive as cold as a cucumber his remorse for his wife s comatose condition is nonexistant and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas the background to the case is such during christmas of sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke the same situation occured in only sunny never woke and probably never will when examined it was found that she had times the normal amount of insulin within her blood claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson convicted and freed on bail he immediately hires alan dershowitz the renowed harvard law professor to acquit him ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him we follow him through two very different cases the case of the johnson case where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn t commit and von bulow who he still hasn t figured out dershowitz doesn t know what happened to sunny and he is extremely hesitant to take the case nevertheless he does based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him together with a group of law students dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed silver s performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film schroeder directs on many different levels with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz there are flaws at times the film gets overly theatrical yet due to glenn close s troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well the flashbacks are good but at times schroeder doesn t fill in the blanks the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film and it could have used a better ending the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly without any intelligent conclusion the supporting characters are often neglected and dershowitz s team should have been allowed to grow character wise but schroeder over simplifies the story and the characters yet for all these flaws the film is deeply engrossing because of irons as von bulow he is brutally evil anti semitic prejudiced arrogant protective he is a rotten lying monster whose conviction may have been wrong legally but morally he was to blame irons plays him to a cold perfection with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder however the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife s death by years of neglect and coldness however legally did he do the murder schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind with all the character flaws reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent he wants the viewer to make up his own mind schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow in death for all the failed dramatic theatrics this is one that works beautifully we don t know what happened that sense of legal ambiguousness along with von bulow s obvious moral guilt is why reversalf fortune works in the end von bulow is as sadistic as ever irons is haunting and that is why reversal of fortune is so good 
jake kasdan son of one of the best screenwriters around breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard to categorize detective story part mystery part comedy part character study and part romance for the most part kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film daryl zero bill pullman is a modern day sherlock holmes the parallel is present down to his love of music though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin and his addiction to drugs amphetamines rather than morphine he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces the case about the man who lied about his age or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes however zero s observance of the fine art of detachment though it makes him a brilliant private investigator makes him somewhat of a self imposed outcast in society he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr watson i mean steve arlo ben stiller arlo is not happy with his job he is thrilled to be around zero s brilliance but his bizarre behavior and strange requests are frustrating to the former lawyer and they re even more so to his girlfriend jess angela featherstone who is fed up that her boyfriend s boss means more to arlo than her this is the situation when a new case comes knocking gregory stark ryan o neill hires zero to find his lost keys it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence now stark is being blackmailed and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end to solve this case zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell however this is when he is vulnerable and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic gloria sullivan kim dickens who may be involved in the blackmail scheme for the first time zero has to question his own objectivity as he finds his client less and less sympathetic zero effect is weakest in its obviously wacky scenes depicting daryl zero s odd behavior such scenes might be appropriate in an out and out satire making zero an ace ventura ish character however there s a much meatier movie in here it just takes a while to get out that s not to say that there s not a place for humor in this film in fact some of the best scenes are ben stiller s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer however the over the top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film and they aren t funny enough to stand on their own once the investigation is underway however zero s brilliance really begins to shine his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock s own as the mystery begins to unfold zero s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions but never lose the viewer zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well zero s relationship with gloria is low key but it hits all the right notes however we are always kept distant from gloria s character she s given plenty of development but we never understand what she is thinking perhaps that may be intentional to place the audience in zero s zone of detachment but on the whole it is frustrating bill pullman when he s not spacing out creates a vibrant character in daryl zero there s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years and it is shockingly moving expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character but one which fits in well and although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called zero seriously it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name although zero effect is a bit awkward in places it is a strong debut for kasdan and shows great promise 
i have to admit that i disliked this film initially it certianly isn t for every taste and it s sheer torture to sit through if you re in a restless mood that said if you are in the right mood it s absolutely incredible this was my second favorite movie of and would have been a shoo in for first in almost any other year perhaps the big turn off for many was this film s unconventionality i d be hard pressed to compare it to any other film that i ve seen it is very very artsy incredibly slow and amazingly it works beautifully on my second viewing i realized that the film follows the three act structure i didn t think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it the first act serves to set up the characters sort of it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness and perhaps even feelings of boredom and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second which encompasses most of the movie the majority of the film is one extended battle scene intercut with brief flashbacks and voice overs the artsier elements do not detract from the action but add to it they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes the battle scenes are amazing second only to saving private ryan in my opinion they re brutal horrifying and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography the second act is as immersive brilliant and haunting as any film that i have ever seen the only problems come during the first and third acts malick takes a little too long to get the film started although the initial scenes which consist of two soldiers experiencing a near eden like paradise while going awol and the preperations for battle are effective and necessary hints of pretentiousness sink in the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this the final act is effective at winding the film down but the problems from the first persist it s a bit too long and comes over as pretentious at times that said there are two sequences one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife and another where one of the main characters is killed that are nothing short of incredible the performances are phenominal all around the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel both of whom should have been nominated for oscars nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation his character is hard mean and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war his place in it and if there s any deeper meaning to the hell that he s going through he is absolutely perfect genuine sympathetic sincere and yet strong when he needs to be although restricted to a relatively small role sean penn is also very good as the company s pessimistic seargent as to how it stacks up to saving private ryan it was my second favorite movie of ryan was my first it s really hard to compare the two they are so so different so i won t beyond saying that spielberg s film had more of an impact on me however the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality i can easily see why someone would the thin red line above ryan i highly recommend both of them and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made all in all the thin red line is filmmaking of an incredibly high order it s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right it s a real shame that it tanked at the box office films this unconventional powerful and thought provoking don t come along very often 
scream isn t quite as clever as its predecessor but it fills the gap with a cutting wit death even gruesome bloody death can be funny if handled the right way some will be offended by this statement but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example and while there s plenty of horror to go around in scream the latest s slasher flick incarnation there are also a few laughs to be had scream is a slice and dice movie for those who don t take their horror too seriously the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise the unexpected blockbuster whose gross soared over the million mark during its six month release window opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time a sequel was inevitable fortunately nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream including director wes craven screenwriter kevin williamson and actors neve campbell courtney cox david arquette jamie kennedy and liev schreiber as stipulated by one of the rules of sequels uttered by a movie obsessed character in the film the body count in scream is higher than that in the original paradoxically there s a lot less gore there is blood of course but nothing excessive by slasher movie standards and there are no depictions of spilled entrails craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids a second strength of scream is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut out stereotypes lined up for slaughter after all we ve known some of these people for two movies it s almost impossible not to care about them at least a little scream opens approximately two years after the original as in the first picture there s a slick self mocking prologue this time the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab which is based on the true life events of scream some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films it s surely no coincidence that in addition to pinkett and epps scream features two black characters shortly thereafter she and her boyfriend have been gutted signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders craven lets loose a burst of tongue in cheek creativity for the movie within a movie sequences they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream an act that he accomplishes with great panache stab features heather graham in the casey becker role played in the original by drew barrymore and tori spelling as sidney prescott neve campbell sadly we only see a couple of scenes from stab it would have been a little more fun i think had craven used joe dante s approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production following the prologue we are re introduced to sidney prescott who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college her friend randy jamie kennedy is a student there as well and he s just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever once the double murder at stab becomes big news the media converges on windsor looking to interview the original victim at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers courtney cox who has a little surprise for sidney she has brought cotton weary liev schreiber the man sidney falsely accused of murder with her also arriving at the college is deputy dewey david arquette who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations in addition to the survivors from the original scream the field of potential victims is well populated there s a blond co ed named cece sarah michelle gellar who has now appeared in two of williamson s movies this one and i know what you did last summer sidney s requisite boyfriend derek jerry o connell a local newswoman laurie metcalf gale s new cameraman duane martin a british drama teacher david warner and several sorority sisters and would be sorority sisters portia de rossi rebecca gayheart elise neal marisol nichols ultimately there are lots of attractive corpses from the stab scenes to lines like brothers don t last long in situations like this craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream and the movie is enjoyable if a little overlong the livelier first hour is better than the second their resolution to the obligatory whodunit is less of a letdown than it could be and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes nice twist quips the killer didn t see it coming didya one senses however that by the end of this picture the overall concept of a hip self referential slasher film has been played out supposedly there s going to be a scream but if the film makers don t come up with something radical we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill 
i don t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people but it s something i used to wonder about when i was younger i can t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat but i m pretty sure andrew niccol screenwriter for the truman show has had the same curious thought the truman show is about a man jim carrey whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public since birth he s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven fla which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign all the people in truman burbank s life are actors and the anonymous townfolk paid extras people watch truman s life hours a day live with no commercial interruptions revenue comes instead from product placement a staple of contemporary hollywood with truman s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else even if you haven t seen the truman show you ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials the trailer and other promotion blitzes if anything i ve written so far is a surprise to you then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news either way you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it because otherwise you ll probably think it sucks it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror reciting the crucial eat me scene from alive wishing his neighbors a good day afternoon and evening and living in domestic bliss with his wife laura linney but weird things start happening a stage light comes falling out of the sky truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child sailing through a rainstorm the death was staged by director christof ed harris who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth not the least of them truman s best friend marlon noah emmerich who assures him he s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he d ever do is hurt him as truman s trusting eyes tear over christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else there s even a daily behind the scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman s existence the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions and it all hinges on carrey who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on he s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura most fundamentally it s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person s life without the person realizing it how they coordinate extras hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this sure the most interesting tv genre of the s has been reality programming and jerry springer s popularity is through the roof but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves and when news shows use hidden cameras it s done in the name of the greater good not entertainment but merge the two and you ve got the truman show right now it s implausible i mean the fcc won t let you say the s word on the air do you think they d let you broadcast every detail of a man s life to the entire world without his consent one day though it could happen and even though it would mean the end of privacy people would eat it up you know they would 
 from the man who presented us with henry the portrait of a serial killer comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida s south coast plot guidance counselor dillon is accused of raping one of his students she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida the counselor is brought to court on the charges as another white trash girl campbell also joins the rape finger pointing club as the story unfolds we find that many things aren t exactly as they seem that s as much as i could say without ruining anything critique good little flick that slows down at certain points and runs a tad long but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout mind you i could see many people not liking it because it takes one too many twists and turns but hey i happen to like that kind of thing and besides the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability or scathingly close to and even explained many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film do not leave the theatre before you see the credits it really does clear up some stuff other than that the acting was good with campbell transforming her good girl stereotypical role into a pot smoking goth looking white trash chick out for a good time denise richards from starship troopers fame solidifies herself as hollywood s jelly donut pinup girl of the moment and proves that all breast implants needn t lead to lawsuits bacon is solid and so is dillon while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world sprinkle the story with a bunch o shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters bacon showing the world the size of his ding dong do we really need to see this a couple of lesbian kissing scenes and a menage a trois and you ve got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre on the down side the soundtrack was not as prominent or slick as i thought it would be and theresa russell real name theresa paup seems to have lost her way in every which way possible ooooh i almost forgot bill murray s exquisite role as the down trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex greed and mystery little known facts neve campbell specified a non nudity clause in her contract she s also born in guelph ontario go hoser director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together as it was gratuitous kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother called the bacon brothers is married to actress kyra sedgwick and has a game based on him called six degrees of kevin bacon 
playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare s works they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare i mean really who doesn t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare and despite the difficulty of their task they have succeeded shakespeare in love is one of the smartest funniest most touching films of the year it s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors but here we have a movie that defines success it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written it could have been a smug self important movie that panders to die hard shakespeare fans but the appeal of this film is almost universal if you ve ever read a play by shakespeare or know anything about his life it s likely that you ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love joseph fiennes brother of ralph stars as shakespeare himself he s a delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly with women and detached from life s more serious problems debt plague etc he s commissioned to write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann tom wilkinson shakespeare however has trouble focusing on his work he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel this all changes however when he meets viola de lesseps a radiant gwyneth paltrow a young heiress set to marry the financially oriented lord wessex colin firth shakespeare instantly falls in love with her he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo he discovers her identity and confronts her later she of course falls in love with him although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare s writing so much and soon the production which later becomes romeo and juliet is set to be performed shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film not because it works as great entertainment but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role he has such searing optimism and energy he s clearly a man who admires shakespeare and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character inability to turn away from women attention deficit disorder we sense a great deal of affection and care he practically overflows with passion in every scene fiennes is matched by paltrow whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i ve seen her in the two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh of course it doesn t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with stoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor all of his plays have similarly dry humor the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play in the movie shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director i m going to have to see the movie again i m certain there are numerous references that i missed in fact i doubt it s possible to gather everything with just one viewing stoppard is a master of detail you ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film not as lines of a play but as dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time there s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe s mysterious death in a pub there s also a scene featuring a wide eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing there s no dog in this play no no dog the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe wilkinson is also hard to recognize but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously ben affleck playing one of the actors in the company shows great range both in his accent his is almost as good as paltrow s and in humor he has some of the best one liners in the movie colin firth always stuck playing the sap does a good job being hateful judi dench however has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words my single minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end the story is moving but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes but my quibbling is not important what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture the sheer skill with which it has been written acted and produced shakespeare in love tries so many things and nails every one of them it s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him a film in which the actors writers and director are all perfectly in sync it s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare s work in a positive way without seeming condescending or superior i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it 
natural born killers is really a very simple story that in essence has already been told in bonnie clyde with some major variations in emphasis mood and degree both films glamorize outlaws in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers both relate the story of a couple liberated by love but where bonnie clyde was partial and subtle natural born killers is total and blatant where bonnie clyde was social natural born killers is psychological what bonnie clyde hinted at natural born killers confronts and explores what bonnie and clyde stole mickey and mallory kill to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them expressed metaphorically as killing subdues the mysterious power this film wields for the most part when mickey and mallory kill they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily they kill what is trying to kill them they kill what dissembles and cowers from life they kill what needs to be killed this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity brahma created vishnu preserved and siva destroyed but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate i m forced to say it for clarity s sake a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes that is destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics your plumber bonnie and clyde mickey and mallory and siva are all productive destroyers i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death presently and historically than any other phenomena muslims kill christians hindus kill muslims christians kill pagans jews kill christians etc you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged religion is an orgy of killing the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn t been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable the state is the divine idea upon earth hegel said meaning it is absolute all powerful ineffable unassailable infallible authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh allah god etc well what does all this have to do with natural born killers let me first say that religions of this nature in the ideal take the place of sex consider the catholic church which in its hey dey took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope cardinals bishops monks etc they forego the one in order to come closer to the other during the middle ages when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power parenthetically witness plato as well in the republic he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself regularly assailing the passions catholicism as policy attacks the passions as evil it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution this is religion this is authoritarianism in its essence as further evidence the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters our culture most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years we can t help but adopt even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self mickey and mallory knox internalized them too then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other discovered them and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves it is a straightforward liberation through sex as some good patriarch once observed you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on m m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers as mickey says as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter let us look each other in the face we are hyberboreans we know well enough how remote our place is neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans even pindar in his day knew that much about us beyond the north beyond ice beyond death our life our happiness we have discovered that happiness we know the way we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth who else has found it the man of today i don t know either the way out or the way in i am whatever doesn t know either the way out or the way in so sighs the man of today this is the sort of modernity that made us ill we sickened in lazy peace cowardly compromise the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay this tolerance and largeur of the heart that forgives everything because it understands everything is a sirocco to us rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south winds as far as i can tell this is what the movie has to say its alleged critique of the media is only secondary tertiary quaternary subsidiary for sure for example wayne gayle s first report ends with some gen x dude saying if i were a mass murderer i d be mickey and mallory in his most excellent bill and ted voice on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he d be just like them killing and destroying what deserves it let me exemplify what i ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant kills him and then castigates him for giving her the worst fuckin head i ve ever had in my life now i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship because demonstrably they didn t and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations but unwilling to kill each other since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation they must kill in place of their lever it s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey as the attendant approached he took on mickey s character in the eyes of mallory she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory upon discovery mallory views this as a betrayal judges him and commutes his sentence on someone else the style of the movie is a whole nother matter that i won t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle the rapid succession of all those mm mm mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish frenetic mood also jungian archetypes abound these can t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind quotes are paraphrased only mickey to mallory one of these days i m gonna be cummin for you in prison while mallory jacks mickey off semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come at the time they haven t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet the two of course go hand in hand for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs mickey during his marriage to mallory as creator of my universe i pronounce us man and wife the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting but telling too it reveals m m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones this is what mickey means by creator of my universe he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears scagnetti s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant s mouth the indian sage releasing mallory s father who was reincarnated as a snake old man go be a snake after telling his snake story that ends with bitch you knew i was a snake after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare mallory says you killed life this is another telling quote because it implies they didn t see themselves as killers of life then what were they killing up to that time in some case just those zombies faking their way through life the living dead as it were in other cases all the anti life forces the cops and their parents the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison it of course symbolizes rebirth dr emil reingold as portrayed by steven wright passing judgement on m m mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong they just don t give a damn this is reminiscent of nietzsche s whole philosophy and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil mickey the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth prayers mickey again in his interview me and you we are not the same species notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader no matter who it is mickey how ya feelin wayne fucking great mickey you got the feelin wayne i m alive i m alive for the first fuckin time what an incredible transformation this is he got the feeling and he couldn t contain himself what a feeling that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe mickey when almost caught in a dead end think think think think go figure it out dwight tommy lee jones in general because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film his whole attitude can be summed up with destroy them 
i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set unless i m watching a movie i don t even have cable so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching the x files every sunday night it s the only show that s worth an hour of my time each week though since i don t watch reruns i m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether i am an avid fan of the show and have been for about three years now and i love gillian anderson the x files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off the film is like a two hour episode except that there are a lot more special effects the plot is thicker and the resolution is more satisfying this is a terrific film both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment i expected to like it more than any episode i ve seen and my expectations were met actually the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices but thankfully the makers managed to do it right when the finale ended the fbi branch known as the x files had been destroyed and our heroes mulder david duchovny and scully gillian anderson were left stripped of five years of hard work the film picks up soon after and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building but wait i m getting ahead of myself the film actually opens in the ice age about years prior during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien the alien s blood infects them fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer and the story jumps into modern times during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy and mulder and scully uncover the cover up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi soon they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens as i ve written before it s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this because everything needs to be a surprise fans of the show will know what to expect and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television there are some truly suspenseful and well created scenes here late in the film when they re in the alien spacecraft you ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema the special effects are very good and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic what i find interesting is that the x files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story our heroes are given subtle introductions we re not expected to know them on the outset and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn t required to understand the film there are of course little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans but i ll keep those as surprises it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly the series is strong for a lot of reasons it s original though it has many ties to the twilight zone and owes some homage to hitchcock and impressively eerie for a television show what really makes the series shine however are the actors duchovny has so much presence and is just a fun guy to watch he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man anderson is equally good and paralyzingly beautiful she s also a strong actress both performers have acted in little more than their series however though i think they ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon i enthusiastically recommend the x files both for fans and non fans is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry it s an intelligent film and takes you places that you might not have been or at least might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar the x files is impressive in concept as well fans of the series are likely to be highly critical and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move it s nice to see a risk pay off for a change actually it s nice to see a risk at all 
driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small intimate story it s a quiet film a slow film a deliberate film but if you re patient with it the movie offers innumerable rewards such as a pair of self assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry s pulitzer prize winning play of the same name which first opened in new york four years ago the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago los angeles london vienna norway and the soviet union uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy he also penned the wonderful sleeper mystic pizza the film like the play is set in atlanta georgia and it revolves around two people in their twilight years a cranky something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a something black man who becomes her chauffeur the movie relies on character rather than plot to propel the action in fact the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense it doesn t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together rather driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life shopping listening to the radio visiting the cemetery eating fried chicken and so on the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta s history including the bombing of the temple the city s oldest jewish congregation and a ceremony honoring the reverend dr martin luther king jr the story begins in with daisy tandy crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway the insurance company cancels her insurance and her son boolie decides to hire her a chauffeur freeman reprising his role from the play plays the chauffeur hoke the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature aging prejudice and a great many other things but more than anything it s about a relationship one that spans years cars the advent of civil rights and one gravely important cent can of salmon daisy is strong willed and set in her ways and from the outset she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur initially she treats hoke with contempt refusing to let him drive her anywhere once she does get in the car daisy is the ultimate back seat driver to make matters worse she is extremely self conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand eventually however daisy is worn down by hoke s good natured charm and infectious cheer she softens and opens up to him tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well but unfortunately this feisty cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace we ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations from on golden pond to cocoon nevertheless tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own freeman as hoke on the other hand gives the more distinctive of the two performances there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color hoke is uneducated and illiterate but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element in full command of their natural charisma they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie s gentle humor at the same time tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama in his first dramatic role dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie tandy s loving and patient son drama seems to agree with aykroyd taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ghostbusters ii the great outdoors my stepmother is an alien the only other significant characters in the film are daisy s housekeeper idella marvelously played by esther rolle good times and boolie s pretentious wife played by patti lupone under the direction of bruce beresford crimes of the heart tender mercies driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again but fortunately beresford never forgets he s shooting a movie and accordingly he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches such as gorgeous shots of flowers trees and tomatoes in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film s dramatic moments the movie tugs at your heart but it never goes for the jugular the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees 
confession time i have never ever seen gone with the wind i don t know why really haven t wanted to check it out on video haven t been at home the nights it was on network tv and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big screen so right up front i ll admit that i don t know what the heck i m talking about but here goes is titanic the gone with the wind of the s maybe that s going a little bit too far as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie they re no clark gable and vivien leigh but the parallels are there gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available technicolor titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors gwtw places america s greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story titanic does the same with the atlantic s most legendary tragedy they both have strong willed redheaded heroines they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves steerage bums they were both incredibly expensive and popular ok maybe that s not enough parallels so titanic s not in gwtw s league no matter titanic is a great movie in its own right complete with spills thrills and especially chills much has been made of the humongous cost of the production and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again the money was obviously well spent the costumes look great the sets look great the cgi graphics look great i especially liked the expensive little touches like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks but writer director producer james cameron s real challenge in writing directing producing titanic wasn t just costuming and set design and special effects cameron s major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in he succeeds masterfully cameron does two things that work incredibly well first he shows us modern day salvage operations on titanic that s just titanic not the titanic mind you the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues year old rose calvert gloria stuart who survived the wreck in stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew secondly cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character and the romantic triangle between rose winslet her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley billy zane and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio the way that big budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all star cast so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board the supporting cast is professional but mostly anonymous other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown there s no moment when you stop and say oh yeah i know him what s he been in although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform or even as the ill fated engineer the love story itself is rather conventional i think some reviewers found it weak and that may be a fair criticism the performances are the key here zane has the meatiest part in the movie and he plays the arrogant condescending steel millionaire to the hilt he s smooth he looks great in a tuxedo and he s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet dicaprio relationship looks plausible at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat you can hear the wheels in his mind turning saying not can i save this little girl but can she help me get on a lifeboat dicaprio is a revelation i hadn t seen him before in anything and didn t know what the heck to expect really honestly i expected a bad irish accent but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive and being on the titanic that it s hard not to like him from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest and he never falters winslet s character grows up a lot during the movie and so does her performance at first she s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop dead gorgeous we know from the narration that she s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane but there isn t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg it s at that moment where winslet s character really comes alive faced with real danger she drops her spoiled rich girl mannerisms and does a splendid job as rose and jack race around the doomed ship looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal s fiery temper winslet turns in a superb acting performance mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror of course the most interesting character is the ship itself cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic and shows her in every mood as a deserted wreck down in the boiler room up on the bridge down in the hold at the captain s table down in steerage and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead cameron s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well 
titanic is without a doubt the best movie i ve seen all year and believe me i m not an easy critic to impress the english patient was too long men in black was over hyped and several of the big summer releases were dead in the water thank god this film got delayed until december it s my christmas present titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years gone by and it is truly a stunning film while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized never taking your eyes off the screen nor checking your watch to see how much longer it s gonna last despite its hour plus running time as a friend of mine who s a true titanic buff said if someone doesn t like this film it s because they didn t want to truer words are hard to come by of course it doesn t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors james cameron who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time if you wish to argue that point with me look at his list of credits the terminator aliens the abyss terminator true lies etc still care to disagree not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film he also wrote produced and edited it and to show his true faith for the project he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs it s obvious he truly loves titanic the film opens with footage both real and fake of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the heart of the ocean which according to bill paxton s character would be worth more than the hope diamond today their search turns up dissapointly no diamond but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a year old woman named rose who claims to be the girl in the picture she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past rose s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl engaged to a rich man named cal hockley billy zane that she didn t want to marry her mother is pushy and obnoxious and cal hockley is arrogant they are boarding the titanic which is sailing to america and this is where she is to marry cal meanwhile a young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his italian friend danny nucci win two rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game they are overjoyed and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving for them this is their ticket to america to a better life for rose she is sailing to her doom the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt kate winslet and jack dawson fall in love it s the classic wrong side of the tracks story and does sometimes resort to a few cliches but as i said above the love portion isn t sappy and doesn t weigh the film down as some critics have said it s sweet and it didn t make me restless at all despite the fact that i usually hate love stories of course it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in including the enigmatic molly brown played by the talented kathy bates the captain of titanic bernard hill and so on all of these characters add an extra depth to the film and make it that easier to watch of course things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom the sinking is depicted realisticly and the effects are truly amazing it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either as people are portrayed as panicking pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats and drowning and dying horrible deaths the best part of the movie in my opinion comes at the very end when we flash back to the future the crew who at first had been skeptical of rose s story now are totally aborbed by her rose goes out onto the ship s ledge and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard we then see a dream of rose s in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream however i think it symbolized more i think it meant that rose had died and is going to a sort of heaven which would be the happiest part of her life her and her one true love jack if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this e mail me at venom hotmail com 
the italian hitchcock and acknowledged master of the giallo murder mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino jennifer connelly a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school s population terrified a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist donald pleasance leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift phenomena is an imaginative original thriller writer director argento creates several sequences of surreal haunting beauty here including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer s beckoning the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer s identity is genuinely shocking and surprising the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden ex rolling stone bill wyman and argento s favourite gothic electronic outfit goblin but it gels surprisingly well the film s opening music reccurs several times an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone argento fans beware the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re titled as creepers this deleted nearly half an hour of footage mainly of key dialogue scenes 
when i first heard about scream in i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies from the master of the horror himself wes craven it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them by making the teenagers do what they know they re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them don t run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door never say i ll be right back etc when i first heard this description i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies was this wes craven s remedy from making real bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn it just seemed cheap to me then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes involving drew barrymore and a nail bitingly intense phone conversation completely changed my attitude scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick it s also a pretty scary movie if you ve seen a million of these kinds of films you know exactly what is going to happen this is part of the fun of watching scream the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent attractive teenagers to those who rarely see these types of movies scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film there s nothing wrong with that misjudgment though i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience the newbies to horror and the fanatics their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive from these varied reviews i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed in my opinion if it was not for the outstanding success of scream the low budget gem may alongside pulp fiction be the most influential film of the s this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs tingle or television programs such as dawson s creek but to others such as myself we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors screenwriters and directors scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly paced script by kevin williamson within the film are characters who tell other characters as well as the audience the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie mainly from the rants of randy jamie kennedy and stu matthew lillard we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well the virgin always survives have sex and you re dead meat not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self satisfaction in this case williamson finds these errors for the audience s satisfaction and amusement i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream which is a spoof of scary movies i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream s perfect subtlety however my last gut feeling about this stuff scream was dead wrong so who knows
