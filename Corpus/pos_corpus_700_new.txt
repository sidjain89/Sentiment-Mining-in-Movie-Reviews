 it s certainly more than just a monster story kenneth branagh director actor co writer of mary shelley s frankenstein kenneth branagh s new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world including the most controversial version of them all directed by james whale the dark and stormy nights the lightning bolts the charnel houses of spare body parts the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful but the center of the film quieter and more thoughtful contains the real story horror fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues morality philosophy and human elements of the story and not on old fashioned horror cliches his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean the year is a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs as the ice closes around his ship a figure appears on the horizon it s a man exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew his name is victor frankenstein kenneth branagh and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown the myserious stranger begins his tale or more precisely his confession in geneva he is remembering his childhood and youth laughter banquets and parties a happy life without troubles or concerns here victor lived with his father ian holm mother cherie lunghi his surrogate sister helena boham carter and his servants in happiness and harmony this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed like thunder from a quite sky his mother dies giving birth to his youngest brother shocked baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair victor already interested in science becomes obsessed with death standing on his mother s grave he says oh mother you did not have to die no one should ever die i will stop this i promiss after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished victor travels to ingolstadt in presuite of a medical career after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night creating life from death composing dead bodies frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man both physically and mentally with strong electrical impulses he managed to breeth life into his creation the result was ugliness realizing what he has done frankenstein tried to undo his work but it was to late the creature has escaped because of the epidemic frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home making plans for the wedding for a while everything is as it was before his mother s death but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously whale s picture although powerful never managed to capture the total depth of the novel brannagh has more or less done that another thing is characters and actors branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast the greatest performances comes from de niro the monster that has been played by among others charles ogle karloff lon chaney bela lugosi glenn strange christopher lee fred gwynne as herman munster and now robert de niro alone hated and feared he is completely aware of his ugliness at first he is like a helpless abandoned child desperately reaching out for love later when he reads frankenstein s journal and learns that he is composed of dead bodies his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge he is capable of killing without regret i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground and then i slowly crushed his neck and as i killed him i saw your face that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator and yet he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all rarely has a cinematic interpretation of the daemon approached the level of three dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster god knows why with the power of an electrical storm almost no time was granted on his charecter who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel here branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character on the outside he is strong ambitious and talented scientist but deep down he is unsecure fragile and vaulerble constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein s surrogate sister who at the end becomes his wife for a little while before death drives them apart the rest of the cast playing secondary characters is solid and nothing less than convincing visually the film is stunning especially the makeup the spinning camera the constantly building up musical acore the art direction the production design the costumes are all magnificent from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests to the plague riddled streets of ingolstadt mary shelley s frankenstein is a wonder to behold kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare all i once loved lies in a shallow grave by my hand and the film ends exacly as hamlet when the creature sets both his and his creator s body on fire the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness and a terrifying last close up on the creature s smiling face can a man create life then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him to whom are its actions then attributable the creature or the being who brought about its existence shelley did not answer these questions but she certainly posed them following her example branagh does the same his film is a tragic saga about playing god victor frankenstein is not an evil man he wanted to change the world to the better in this he represents everything science stands for acting without doubts never considering the consequences of his actions produced by francis ford coppola frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film dracula in comparison i can say that dracula has visuals that even frankenstein can not live up to but when it comes to story characters and casting frankenstein is stronger but stronger than both of them on every aspect is neil jordan s interview with the vampire although the film is not perfect the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective these minor faults are easily forgivable as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating branagh has probably created one of the best if not the best adaptions of shelly s classic novel 
the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now it mu t be found so what exactly is the fifth element after seeing luc besson s ambitious much shrouded in secrecy science fiction fantasy i could not help but be let down by the actual answer which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps the actual storyline is the most conventional dismayingly so element pun intended of the film speaking in the vaguest possible terms the basics of the plot are as follows in the year a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth and only the four elements earth wind fire and water united with a fifth element can stop it figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas bruce willis a shady southern drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg the hilariously hammy gary oldman picking up where he left off in besson s the professional a priest ian holm and a mysterious creature named leeloo milla jovovich all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming and unsurprising fashion but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest what remains interesting and exciting however after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil director of photography thierry arbogast visual effects supervisor mark stetson and the crew at digital domain the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last the frenzied cityscape of new york with its vibrant day glo colors tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds and the swarm of cars cabs and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways is absolutely breathtaking to behold especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren t equally as interesting and are they ever in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world from bulky robots to dog like mangalores the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean paul gaulthier best known for creating madonna s pointy bustier get up in her blonde ambition tour gaulthier s outlandish creations such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps feel more at home in besson s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film while besson s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience for all its imagination certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film ruby rhod chris tucker a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed at first this character s hyper energy is funny but the act wears out its welcome very quickly not irritating but just as strange is a musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva maiwenn lebesco who sings and dances an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno the tune as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra s innovative score is haunting but it is also completely jarring then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout which too often are silly and forced a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny to boot the story s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element while still visually and aurally spectacular the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be the big serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward as such at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself who told me in the lobby following the screening imagine that the filmmaker watching the film with the enemy the critics that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half now titled mr shadow is still waiting to be made still despite the story problems the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson rarely does a filmmaker s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious undiluted glory it is a fascinating example of how of one artist s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams 
life is beautiful is a rare treat a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful or even worse humorless it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce stirs in a little poignancy and ends up a very enjoyable movie it s an italian film but don t let that discourage you subtitle phobes will be missing a wonderful experience life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy with the clownish but good natured guido roberto benigni arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle the year is and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams dora nicoletta braschi their romance seems to be picture perfect with only one stumbling block she s already engaged to another man can guido overcome the odds and win his girl what do you think however five years later things have taken a turn for the worse in italy the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue giorgio cantarini who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp unable to protect his boy in any other way guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game with points awarded for such tasks as hiding being brave and being very very quiet as you can tell from the description life is beautiful has two very different tones but manages to excel at both of them as a romantic comedy it is sweet and funny as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair it is touching roberto benigni s work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin s and it is easy to see why he is able to run the gamut of comic expression from slapstick to farce with a warm hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero s triumph of the underdog spirit life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust however it is able to successfully navigate the minefield without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears with life is beautiful benigni has created a triumphant but bittersweet comedy it s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i ve had at the movies this year 
it is with hesitance that i call apocalypse now a masterpiece certainly it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease and some of the finest actors of the s the plot an adaptation of joseph conrad s heart of darkness was set in vietnam and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant coming on the heels of the end of the war apocalypse certainly has its moments some of which are the finest in film history the plot is fairly simple captain willard sheen is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a nd tour of duty his mission is simple take a boat up to cambodian territory and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz brando with extreme prejudice along the way willard runs into a series of adventures including one with lt col kilgore duvall and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies willard s four person crew finally make it to kurtz compound where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives willard s experiences with kurtz take up the last half hour with a confrontation and eventual ending the movie is visually breathtaking the battle scenes are exquisitely done and the score is brilliant setting a murky mood of darkness that is first rate the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie the journey to kurtz camp is quite a ride with psychosis setting in on almost every character the most interesting one is kilgore the lt col who cares more about the surf than about the mission it is at times revolting psychotic and incredible and it is one hell of a movie the scenes are bold inventive and powerful and the acting is stunning especially be sheen duvall and fishburne the narration is exquisite as is the mystery of kurtz coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam kind of like saving private ryan on lsd the film is jarring in its implications and psychotic in its execution the problems come when the film slows down one of the major scenes in the film where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz is a colossal mess the dialogue is confusing the lighting is atrocious and the scene drags on for terrible minutes of film the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound the film slows down to a drag sheen seems forever captured by a madman played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received brando is in the film for no more than minutes but is bathed in shadows the entire time making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic the scenes are poorly done the dialogue is muffled and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief sheen seems to adore this man but why the viewers are never told the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god like kurtz but the scenes fall way short of expectations granted it has its moments which are brutally horrific but the general feeling is one of confusion brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir and my feeling was that this could never be a great man this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him so why do they do it there are moments of brilliance but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending the finest scene at the end is sheen s escape and his entrace into the temple his rise out of the water with the smoke coming off of his slicked head is a brilliant seconds of film yet you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times and indeed the film on the whole is very good it is a stunningly flawed expression of film for it addresses major issues such as man s mental stamina during bouts of war but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful had the character of kurtz been more explored and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece but it could have been so much more rewarding 
the heartbreak kid reviewed on aug th starring charles grodin cybill sheppard eddie albert in the heartbreak kid charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i ve seen on screen in a long time he s a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film as the film opens he has just gotten married and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon halfway there he begins to resent his bride by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character he is ready to divorce his wife as played by grodin this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him the phrase the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence was practically written with him in mind however if he finds something he really wants he will pursue it for as long as it takes the only problem is once he has it he immediately loses interest the end of the heartbreak kid is both hilarious and sad for that very reason charles grodin is at his smarmy best here and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin s desire however the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin daughter of director elaine may as grodin s whiny bride she owns every scene that she s in and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do the heartbreak kid was written by neil simon and it shows simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships and he s at the top of his game here as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is he s the type of guy that everyone knows the character of george costanza on seinfeld seems to have been modelled after him the only problem with the film is that it s not that funny and it s billed as a comedy as much as i could see the realism in the characters it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there the heartbreak kid is not a date movie it has an extremely negative view of relationships so seeing it with a girlfriend boyfriend could be hazardus to your health 
for more than a decade anjelica huston has been one of america s finest actresses in her directorial debut bastard out of carolina based upon dorothy allison s largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth in post world war ii south carolina through voice over narration done by laura dern we find that she nearly didn t survive birth as her single mother anney played by jennifer jason leigh was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident that s just the beginning of her troubles bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come anney meets and weds lyle a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident anney s brother earle played by michael rooker introduces her to glen played by ron eldard a co worker at the mill glen the black sheep of a wealthy family when are you gonna make your daddy proud i ll tell you when never he s told and filled with bitterness courts anney and eventually wins her despite warnings of a violent temper when anney miscarries with his much prized baby boy glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone beating and abusing her while the love dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment while set several decades ago this story remains completely relevant in today s society where abused wives return to their husbands and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other the real star of this domestic drama is not top billed jennifer jason leigh but child actress jena malone who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance her work is of award calibre and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged kirsten dunst tina majorino anna paquin natalie portman christina ricci elijah wood malone s performance stands up well leigh s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine although she s not really given much to do and ron eldard work is very solid skillfully manouvering his character s moods in and out of explosive rage one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure cooker ticking away of the supporting cast special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker s performance there s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms to the familiar sight of a dried up uptight wise old granny played by grace zabriskie sitting on the porch rocking chair to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance still it cannot be denied that anne meredith s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power huston s direction of the film is surehanded and impressive giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast particularly the young malone her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard hitting emotional rather than graphic manner and are very effective huston s talent with camera positioning is wonderful from a visually striking shot done through a fan to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile the film has the toned down feel of a television production bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing 
almost a full decade before steven spielberg s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both anti war and pro soldier john irvin s hamburger hill proved it could lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone s platoon this excellent film was dismissed as too militaristic it s hard to understand exactly why unless irvin in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable and often naive reasons chose to show up for the vietnam debacle has refused to present us with the stone killer drug stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what the polack the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn became to wwii movies hamburger hill based on a true story is not an easy film to watch there is a scene that will have graying anti war activists squirming in their seats or moved to genuine tears and the climactic final assault on the hill in question is visually confusing gristly realities are presented in brief flashes as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee veteran and newbie black soldier and white become almost indistinguishable from each other as they do in the chaos of actual combat the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b vance as doc in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as seaman jones in mctiernan s red october if you ve seen private ryan you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg s vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach 
i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage grousing to myself about its transparently planes trains and automobiles plot machinations and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement this was a mass market romantic comedy after all a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and even in its best days worked hard to perpetuate the romance infatuation paradigm then marc lawrence did something wonderful something which made the entire film click into place he showed me a comic love story about grown ups it certainly didn t look that way from the outset which introduces groom to be ben holmes ben affleck at his bachelor party surrounded by friends and family whooping over his last night of freedom ben loves his fiancee bridget maura tierney but the doom and gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this till death do you part business then on an ill fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah ben meets sarah lewis sandra bullock a free spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn ben and sarah begin a three day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger ben seeing in sarah the chances he s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she s never had forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue ben is an ideal role for affleck s easy going charm and he plays the straight laced straight man without forced exasperation sandra bullock for her part is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half dozen films combined avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping the two performances part of a great top to bottom cast are effective and connected from the start yet the script s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self justification the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution forces of nature isn t about a man developing a fear of commitment it s about a man learning what commitment means to him learning that it s not what he thought it was lawrence s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom that is provided you re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes for a brisk romantic comedy forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over directed scenes of the year teetering hand held shots why not low or high angles sweeping pans occasionally the hyper real approach works with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance far more often hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can t find what s underneath a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director but even hughes excesses can t spoil this unique concoction forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents 
as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences you know the type his shirt is always shredded his face always scarred he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a to kill list for his enemies oscar hungry director executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to but he made the stereotypical action hero for the th century as gibson delivers lines like before this war is over i am going to kill you schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind oddly enough the patriot is as much an epic three hour tear fest like gladiator as it is a ninety minute guilty pleasure at times absorbing at others enjoyably insipid this is good bloody summer fun i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july th weekend some of the images are so zealously americanized the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it like emmerich s id this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all sure it s predictable and melodramatic but for a moment after leaving the theater i was dumbfounded with patriotism and isn t that the point of the patriot gibson plays benjamin martin the lionized french and indian war veteran who at the beginning of the film is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants not slaves as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel jason isaacs martin quickly decides to save the day or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war martin becomes the number one target of the british army the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis tom wilkinson face was priceless entertainment and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time a final battle is inevitable as for the numerous battle scenes they are expertly done clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period everything is performed in an orderly but still quite gory fashion one side shoots then the other side then the remaining soldiers charge it s organized strategic and according to martin ineffective there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin s take no prisoners method what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington played wonderfully by jason isaacs tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians who nervously avoid eye contact this character is viciously evil he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home even his eyes are evil his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as cowardly and sadistic i disagree with this accusation tavington does not represent his country his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general besides tavington the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys heck why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down it s a lethal weapon for the colonial times god bless america and god bless the patriot 
for the first reel of girls town you just can t get over lili taylor is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student harder still can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part with the sure showy expertise of a de niro taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck you confidence she can muster it s a deeply felt dead on performance and by the halfway point you ve forgiven taylor her own maturity for all its verite pretenses girls town is less about a bunch of high schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer performers examining their own feelings about rape relationships and american womanhood the movie s opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation patti angela bruklin harris emma anna grace and nikki aunjanue ellis but about minutes into the film we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life the remaining girls manage to smug nikki s diary out of her grieving mother s home and page through it at patti s place investigating the root of nikki s despair what they find is cruel and galvanizing nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen shell shocked by the truth of the matter the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player patti s barely sympathetic wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock s car and anyway patti s had her own share of guys who wouldn t take no for an answer pained acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry angry about the impossibility of saying no and angry with themselves for being weak for being naive for putting up with it why do we put up with it emma finally asks once the argument has reached a fever pitch we try to talk about it and look what happens we fight for minutes there s the admirable crux of this picture girls town is a political film in that it calls for action but it s incomplete it s never quite sure how to justify that action or what form it should take the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity and it s surely one of this year s most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger side window of that damn jock s car doing the right thing they hang out in the bathroom chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall subvert the patriarchy emma writes and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to the girls silence their hecklers take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti s child and eventually come face to face with nikki s tormentor still the movie has a desperately unfinished quality and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls but nobody thinks of it perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah who you callin a bitch the points are well taken but they should have been unnecessary long on characterization but a little short on story girls town is less than it could have been and too self congratulatory for my own taste director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r e m s michael stipe he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking the movie was created and scripted by committee but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when predictably the group couldn t secure funding then again girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film the movie s slapdash quality is key to its significance truth be told all three of the leads look too wise for high school but that s ok there s a once removed quality to their fine spontaneous performances as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were the girls they wish they had been or some combination for all its flaws this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place 
wow what a movie it s everything a movie can be funny dramatic interesting weird funny weird and strikingly original yep that pretty much describes this movie it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest funniest most original movies i have ever seen it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often besides being one of the best films of the year being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever period then again there are so many good movies that one cannot pick an all time favorite john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job in search of a job his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of craig finds a job as a file at the floor of a business building you have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight the floor is just a floor between and he is hired by his year old boss orsen bean to be a filer in his office he discovers a little door to which was boarded up and hidden to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich s mind fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike he returns to tell his co worker maxine catherine keener that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich s mind she doesn t believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns that we don t know what really happened john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world s most prettiest women is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage to the master himself the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever spike jonze three kings makes his fabulous directing debut and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought provoking the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart warming the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles from cameron diaz s appearence to john malkovich s explorations i laughed very hard and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets the funniest there isn t a slow point in the movie or an overused idea there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original inventie witty and smart movie i ve seen in a long time i found myself amazed by everything the direction acting writing and the whole idea of the movie by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn t want to make movies like this anymore or why they don t all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out this was a surprise hit as was american beauty being john malkovich is in the top movies of the year and in the top best films ever made it has something that no other movies playing now has in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now i highly recommend being john malkovich and have no doubts you will be disappointed

is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all time it s quite possible his career spanned over years and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could yet when he is talked about in the media he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role the nice guy and that s really a shame the naked spur features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him it s a western which stewart specialized in around this period and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend before he finds that man though he runs into two men who agree to help him thinking he is a sheriff when the criminal is eventually caught the two men discover stewart s secret and decide they want a piece of the action too the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal well played by janet leigh we re never too sure who s side she s really on until the end leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the shower lady from psycho and that s unfair she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men stewart gives a performance unlike anything i ve ever seen from him he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs but here he gets downright hysterical at times i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a nice guy his performance borders on psychotic at times but i loved watching every second of it it s roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do he was an actor unafraid to take chances and even ruin his public image 
there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason good will hunting is about one of those people the will hunting of the horrible title let s face it this film would be a bitch to title played by co writer matt damon is a mathematical genius he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino and he works at mit as the janitor one day the professor of one of the most challenging courses proffessor lambeau breaking the waves s stellan skarsg rd puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete the next day it s already done on the board but no one in his class claims to have done it so lambeau puts another problem on the board this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove and duh it s done again of course they catch the guy who did it red handed will before lambeau can find will again he ran away when he caught him will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court and struck a police officer so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements a he work with him on math and b he get some therapy after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another for a hypnotist he fakes being under his spell then launches into an impromptu performance of the s classic afternoon delight finally lambeau s old college roomate sean mcguire robin williams a psych professor agrees to treat him and the two begin a rocky relationship as sean tries to get will to open up turns out will had a rough childhood being abandoned and placed in foster homes and what not it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life he wants a challenge and that is to hang out with his buds including the other co writer ben affleck and do honorable jobs like construction is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky should this guy be forced to do something he doesn t want to do this appears to be one of the million questions in this film which is jam packed with greatness but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should i m not saying good will hunting is a bad film at all it s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments and lots of great things about it the acting is amazing with two oscar nomination worthy performances from damon and williams who have amazing chemistry together we also get some great support from stellan skarsg rd great name ben affleck and from minnie driver who plays will s love interest skylar there are tons of individual moments that i adored i loved all the comedy in the film especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks his various attempts at therapy and of course my favorite scene in the entire film the one where he delivers a long exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them i liked the relationship between some of the people like will and skylar will and sean sean and lambeau and will and his friends there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal that i felt rightfully uncomfortable like the break up scene between will and skylar will and sean s first meeting a bar scene between sean and lambeau and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn t regret meeting his first wife who would later suffer a slow painful death and leave him lonely and slightly bitter however the main flaw of the film is there s too much of everything and not enough of it either the film tries for deeper relations between the characters but they re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten take for example the relationship between sean and will the film gets an interesting father son as well as doctor patient relationship going with out any problems but when it tries to show them as equals it falls on its face we hear how they went to the same town and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do also will s relationship with his best friend chuckie affleck has a nice climax but not enough rising action we see them joking around but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one their relationship never goes beyond just best friends and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more human maybe it was just me and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau but that again is underwritten and of course as in most films like this the girl boy relationship is pretty underwritten we never understand what they see in each other so when skylar confesses that she loves him it seems more like it s there for plot details that anything else minnie driver is interesting though and breathes life into her character the writing is a bit at fault here but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness sure it feels overstuffed but it s extremely enjoyable the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh and seems extremely human i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue which is amazing while this is probably director gus van sant s most conservative film you d hardly know it s the same director of to die for the only van sant film i ve seen really it s still a pretty remarkable film albeit a tad overrated what s this best picture deal and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone 
kevin smith is like a big kid his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile s he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books having also written a few he also has a cult following mostly composed of teenagers college students and smith s own fellow adolescent minded grownups smith is hilarious in person and in writing but when he tries to be earnest and moralize that is when he goes wrong kevin smith is a better writer than director and he ll be the first to tell you that that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy handed great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them this was true in the overrated chasing amy and it is true for dogma as well that is not to say smith s message is a bad one in dogma smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god s desires is superior to anyone else s basically dogmatism is bad changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight they also know what is best for you whether you like it or not this is not exactly a new message in movies see inherit the wind but i have no problems with recycling old ones particularly since dogma s protesters are proving smith s point smith s own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book but this is smith s personality and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible or koran etc correctly or if there even is a correctly and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany linda fiorentino being chosen by voice of god metatron alan rickman to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels bartleby ben affleck and angel of death loki matt damon along the way forgotten thirteenth apostle rufus chris rock stripper muse serendipity salma hayek and slacker duo jay and silent bob jason mewes and kevin smith himself come to bethany s aid fallen muse azrael jason lee proves to be the behind the scenes manipulator for all the chicanery the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith s points and in itself has little dramatic momentum among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman jesus was black and the bible was written by a bunch of racist misogynistic white men of course kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes smith thought it might give validation to protesters claims that the film was sacrilegious but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke the film s humor is uneven some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning bush kind of entrance but many of the film s jokes just bomb as in virtually anything involving salma hayek s serendipity also some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away still smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace among the actors fiorentino and rickman stand out by far fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight damon and affleck are fairly lackluster rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob who recur in all of smith s movies are much more in line with smith s brand of humor bud cort george carlin janeane garofalo guinevere turner and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances 
 s alien marked not only the death by suicide of its popular protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver but in many ways the alien franchise itself box office receipts were anemic thanks to poor audience word of mouth and the critics who rallied around the first two installments s alien and s aliens savaged david fincher s slog of a sendoff myself included hence weaver director jean pierre jeunet and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two fold challenge not only somehow resurrect ripley but also rescue this once profitable series from the scrap heap despite the odds they have succeeded even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two writer joss whedon devises a quick easy and painless answer to the dead ripley problem clone her which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina the prison planet of the third film that done the real challenge presents itself what do with her alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable exploring her maternal side alien saw her undergoing the seven stages of death what could be next whedon comes up with a clever spin since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen the blood used for the clone is also infected with alien dna so the new ripley is indeed new a human alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength a psychic bond with the deadly species and a more predatory attitude unfortunately that is where alien resurrection s clever streak in writing stops the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding but once the creatures break free it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers including tough waif call played by a game winona ryder trying to exterminate them and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy while the settling into tried and true formula is a little disconcerting the formula is tried and true for a reason and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon the alien after all these years is still terrifying and a new breed that is introduced is no less so the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting most notably an extended underwater sequence the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji as technically adept as jeunet s direction is perhaps his and for that matter whedon s greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for but the self awareness of the excess just adds to the fun no alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott s alien or the even greater film that james cameron s aliens was but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher s alien jeunet s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild reckless thrill ride that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments 
i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x files first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable you have to reach for a larger audience therefore the movie is quite user friendly altough non fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no i am not a fan of the x files i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium however since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the x files is what a summer should be exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank from start to finish this movie does not let go of you when i compare it with last summer s movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the x files is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the x files is a monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total no the x files is definately a mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much no this is mulder s time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you let s just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who cares if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies don t the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take a breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the x files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves a purpose who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attacks so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the x files is what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effects it s got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non fans will have a good time it does not provide answers to the show s many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah i never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half a star well i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop it s pretty obvious the film s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving 
ingredients man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers synopsis what if you woke up one day and suspected you were not on earth and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers in dark city john murdoch rufus sewell has this problem dark city starts out like a s noir amnesia detective mystery poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench coats as well as by the police and the dogged inspector bumstead william hurt is john a murderer and what can his missing memories tell him he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues but when the clues don t fit it doesn t just confuse him it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city to john something is fishy and very unreal about this city how come it s always dark and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city or how to get to nearby shell beach every night around midnight john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation and at this time creepy alien experimenters known as the strangers come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people s heads with big hypodermic needles the strangers have the ability to tune or warp reality using telepathic powers turns out the city is not on earth at all and the reason why john doesn t fall victim to the nightly suspended animation is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god like reality warping abilities as the strangers even with the help of scientist dr daniel schreber can john take back the dark city opinion director alex proyas he also directed the crow mentions this in the dark city press kit in films science fiction is always used to have big spaceships blow up cities i think we re a little tired of that according to director proyas probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers it s designed so that you can watch the film over again and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch it s a philosophical piece cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens whether they be klingons giant bugs or proponents of the dark side of the force but science fiction in books reaches beyond the shoot em up level and targets the big questions questions like who are we what is the human condition what is ethical what would a true human being do far from comic book style on the order of spawn batman or the mutant ninja turtles dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay a little more than years ago the world was filled with unhappy peasants unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian military conformist medieval regimes the people took refuge in religion the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering but after death heaven would be available meanwhile the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven when science finally overturned religion the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud kant kafka nietzsche and dostoevsky pondered what society should be and what place the individual had in it the existentialists in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile indifferent or alienated universe in dark city when the last dying defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens scientific experiments on the human beings brains failed murdoch replies pointing to his head because the human condition isn t located in here 
it is simply amazing how the green mile developed in its three hour running time based on the stephen king series of the same title the film starts out painfully slow with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue however as the plot begins to progress the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction frank darabont who masterfully followed a prisoner s story in the shawshank redemption this time follows the perspective of a prison guard paul edgecomb tom hanks through edgecomb s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner the green mile is successful in creating sympathy for kind hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb the ensemble acting in the film is perfect hanks david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson sam rockwell and michael duncan hutchinson playing percy wetmore a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie every time he appears on the screen the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks rockwell an independent film veteran plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child like behemoth very similar to lennie small in of mice and men his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause his pain creates pain for the viewer however it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at the jerry springer show the scene containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief as the film flashes back to graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is the scene is neither sad nor convincing greene is not even given a final word like some of the other characters and we don t even see him walk the infamous green mile however as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters such as coffey and eduard delacroix michael jeter as well as the five prison guards the film becomes more interesting the speed in the green mile is perfect if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character the green mile is so good following the rough beginning that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing if you survive the first third of the green mile sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment 
if there s one thing in common about all of hollywood s major studios it s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively it s obvious there s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater so when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production it s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no thought movie quite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen the story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statement making in the cinema not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite a bit of luck find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named pleasantville maguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudo world but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the father knows best times it s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in a quite unlikely way what life is really like soon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness at one end is a soda shop owner turned painter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is a close minded mayor j t walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town fine performances are turned in all around maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j t walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance daniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman s envy for daniels it s his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh it s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish there s not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don t 
so here is the second of s remakes of classic horror movies the first was the dumb pathetic but ok remake of the classic the haunting now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people to stay in his house if they survive the night they get the money if not well you get the jurisdiction having not yet seen the film dvd on its way i wasn t sure if i would really like the remake but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on geoffrey rush in a fantastic role with an incredible performance is steven price the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list somehow someone or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party eddie taye diggs an ex baseball player sarah ali carter an ex assistant who can re wire anything melissa brigette wilson a talk show host in sorts dr blackburn peter ghallager and watson chris kattan a smart mouthed humorist in ways what he is gonna do is pay these five people dollars if they can survive through the night if they can they get the money if not well they don t the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr there forcing him to lock the place up because if he died so did they everyone who was in there burned to death now it is steven price s home and he is throwing this party for these five people what starts out as a seemingly normal night turns into a horrifying blood splattering night the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed one by one the people start to disappear conspiracies start to turn up and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all the people find rooms which once held mental patients rooms which once had people dying rooms which may still contain these people now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house and they must survive each other with terrorfying results since i officially haven t seen the original i can t say which is better i can say however i liked this movie geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price and does a great job doing a vincent price role famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy and even sometimes downright scary i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous one thing i knew not to expect was a haunting type movie with special effects galore even though it had fantastic gore and special effects the movie has only a million dollar budget which doesn s show all the way through but you can tell the movie was written well and it s only major flaw is the under developed characters and plot holes that we are left with the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise i was expecting another haunting with special effects no scares and a dumb ending instead i found a good halloween movie with gore scares and great acting house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can t take seriously though it is a well made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws but besides that the movie is fun smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can t be made all the time 
don t let the following quirks of this review fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that life is beautiful even though i m a short ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh life is beautiful even though i haven t amounted to much in life except working out the finer intricacies of waitering i m a lucky sort of a guy especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath life is beautiful i m a jew but life can still be beautiful the nazis put me in a concentration camp but life is still beautiful i love my son very much and that s what matters and that s what makes life beautiful my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful i get shot for my efforts and the woman i love but hey that s life and that s still a beautiful thing so by jove don t give me any crap about it by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved well done there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni 
this remake of la cage aux folles features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son s future in laws the couple robin williams and nathan lane are about as archetypal or as the less kind might put it stereotypical gays possible williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode williams is excellent as should be no surprise gene hackman as right wing potential father in law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles the real star is lane his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight shooting uncle is hilarious perhaps it is a personal failing on my part but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it luckily for me at least it doesn t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men their son and the deception the question of stereotypes is a touchy one these guys personify the homophobic gay image you can almost hear the swishing if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world you ll be outraged but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals you ll love it your choice 
if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child would you do it gattaca is a film which presents a future where society has answered yes to this question but then ponders if this was actually the right decision gattaca came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature the lovable dolly the sheep and with this in mind the film only becomes more frightening the way the realm of genetics is heading it may only take a couple decades until the future gattaca presents becomes true contrary to the misleading trailers gattaca is not a sci fi thriller in the way that there s lots of murder hitchcockian suspense and chase scenes this is a quiet sad film about intelligent theories in fact the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley the latter who s novel brave new world featured genetically engineered children it s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia which is exactly what gattaca presents and the main reason i dug it so much the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ethan hawke a man with high hopes but a chance of heart problems and a prospected life span of around years as a child he was put down because of the threats of genetics while his younger genetically perfect brother anton loren dean was promised whatever his heart desired vincent yearns to be an astronaut but when he gets a job at a giant space company it s as a janitor ernest borgnine plays his boss but one day he finds out that it s probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist or something german wings tony shalhoub who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in men in black a life less ordinary who s client is a genetically perfect man jerome morrow jude law who has unfortunately been crippled fortunately though there s no record of the accident and he s willing to give someone else his life since vincent looks a bit like him after a couple alterations some minor some really major he has donned the life of jerome and is doing his job there he meets a genetically imperfect woman irene uma thurman who s genetically perfect in real life anyway hee hee and the two begin a kind of relationship albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man s stats are however a murder of a high level worker at his office is killed and one of vincent jerome s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi wily inspector hugo alan arkin and none other than vincent s long lost brother anton who hasn t seen him since they were teenagers we know vincent jerome didn t do it but with his older picture being posted everywhere not only vincent jerome s in trouble but also the real jerome who s as much in it as he is however there isn t many big suspense set pieces which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in the film would lose it s message and descend into just being a sci fi thriller a la william gibson the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening there are no big distractions from the point of the film much to the dismay of commercial audiences what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created irene has no real spunk in her life and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man claiming that his accident was really no accident what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that and the ending is shocking as it s a definite work of dystopian propaganda but doesn t have the down ending of other works of this kind the production design of this film is probably the best i ve seen this year it s stunning very pleasing to the eye but still very cold since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery and the sequence of all the high level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam esque feel to it showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie like life the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy the acting from everyone is great with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway interesting pointless fact uma and ethan started dating after this film and currently she is pregnant with his child but the best performance belongs to jude law who steals every scene he s in and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i m not sure of gattaca warns us not to go any farther chiefly because we ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are and when i see a possible future featuring a fingered piano player well folks that just creeps me out 
synopsis leonard shelby pearce is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife leonard has only a few clues to the murderer s identity to make matters worse he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short term memories meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier because of this leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself memento traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination review memento is the sort of movie i wish i d written i can think of no higher praise than that i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant involved original movie as this an instant film noir classic memento is virtually flawless the script is unlike any i have ever seen a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity although the idea of starting at the conclusion of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the start is not entirely new never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence memento is endlessly exciting and inventive a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively nolan s direction is equally effective never losing its crispness and clarity despite memento s challenging gimmick and to top everything off all the performances rise to the occasion pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie and pantoliano s teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality memento may be the year s best screenplay and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 
there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor s effort often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile when one of these comes along i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders but sometimes there is simply no other explanation and such is the case with the hurricane this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter would normally be called norman jewison s the hurricane as per the tradition of referring to a film belonging to a director but though he does decent work jewison cannot claim ownership of the hurricane because there is one reason this film works at all and his name is denzel washington washington plays carter a boxer who in was convicted of a late night shooting in a bar jailed for years he maintained that he had never committed the crimes but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter through the efforts of that group and carter s lawyers he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted the film details carter s childhood which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop dan hedaya when he finally got out of prison for good carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer seemingly having his career on track until the police framed him for multiple homicide despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities he remained imprisoned flash forward to when lesra vicellous reon shannon a young african american boy living with a group of canadian tutors reads the book carter wrote while in prison the book entitled the sixteenth round opens young lesra s eyes to the injustice that was carter s life and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer lesra convinces his canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah to work with him towards his goal the hurricane leans on denzel washington he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will and he does so brilliantly it s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter a fictional personality invented solely for the film the actor s work is masterful washington throws himself into every moment refusing to keep the audience at arm s length we feel everything he feels the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost washington s is a performance of weight and emotional depth he doesn t merely play angry happy or sad he feels it at the deepest level his work is masterful and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor norman jewison directs the film doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection the hurricane moves quickly with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is and nothing is terribly confusing his boxing scenes constructed with clear inspiration from raging bull get inside the action very well and they are believable as real sports footage jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick carter is sent to solitary confinement for days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform and jewison assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell jewison s best achievement in the hurricane is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard knock life and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again sadly though the film s chief failures lie with the screenplay as with most of the good but not great efforts to round the pike this winter there is much to interest a viewer in the hurricane but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich d route possible it does take a look at the supporting characters for example who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil carter and lesra played nicely by shannon who deserves credit are the only real people here everyone else is a stereotype the canadians are good the cops are bad the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey dovey commune and it is a commune despite the film s failure to make that clear while every racist cop especially dan hedaya s melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey hate put me in prison love s gonna bust me out and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made for tv lifetime special it s too bad the cast is game the director does his job and the subject matter is interesting but the script takes the safer slightly more boring route far too often i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than he s a racist pig i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice in short i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens criticism has been levied against the liberties the hurricane takes with the truth of what really happened to carter and much of it is deserved for example the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only to be screwed by the judges who ruled giardello the winner most accounts of the fight however have carter losing fairly furthermore much of carter s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained of course the hurricane works mainly as a fable so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially but even dismissing such issues don t remove one fact the hurricane is a highly flawed film only one actor could have made a schmaltzy predictable picture like this work as well as it does and it s a good thing the hurricane has that actor carter has been quoted as saying denzel washington is making me look good but he s not the only one washington makes this film look good denzel washington s the hurricane sounds pretty good to me 
weir is well respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject matter into deceptively simple powerful films the mosquito coast utopia and fearless post traumatic stress disorder among them in the truman show weir essentially breathes life into the now tired concept of media manipulation by tackling the material from the inside out it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top form playing the title character truman burbank by now you must be aware of the premise unbeknownst to him truman carrey is the star of his own tv series a peep show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants seahaven his hometown and the show itself are the brainchild of christof harris who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon directing over cameras and hundreds of actors and extras for years truman suspects nothing we accept the reality we re given poses christof but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in fiji mcelhone who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement overwhelms him thus christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly rated program in a few broad strokes weir creates a convincing second reality and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three quarters through this allows us to comprehend and accept truman s world before we contextualize it for all his madness christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be well so darn nice like a sibling or perhaps more appropriately a caged animal in an interactive zoo they want to see him succeed the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey he really is an everyman here abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible wide eyed bewilderment cinematically the truman show is impeccable stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images as well it employs wojciech kilar s piece zycie za zycie masterfully and beautifully if the film has any flaws one may find them in laura linney s characterization as meryl truman s wife i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone and in a subplot involving truman s father which feels curiously incomplete there are a few stupendous sequences and the film pulls off a wonderful trick we become truman s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film they wear buttons asking how will it end i couldn t wait to know myself though i didn t exactly want it to end for this inspired movie is possibly the best and most complex summer picture in years 
i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex yes more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster for all teenagers it s almost like a rite of passage and what we did was sometimes downright nasty sometimes funny and sometimes shocking and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer american pie is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year just how great are their hormones raging one of them notes after watching disney s the little mermaid that ariel is soooo hot the four schoolmates are kevin oz finch and jim kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend but doesn t want to have sex until the time is just right but what is the perfect time there is just no way to know and that frightens him oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages finch is the phobic hermit who doesn t stand a chance with any girl so he pays someone to start spreading rumors about his prowess suddenly girls are lining up to go out with him but among these friends it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student his inexperience comes shining through he has much to learn and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom s apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking raunchy yet unbelievably funny the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its r rating there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that there s something about mary was gloriously ribald in fact at first this film received a sinful nc rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen accessible rating but i guess after seeing the no holds barred coarseness of south park this seems tame by comparison teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest but unlike many teen sex comedies there is a genuine intelligence at work here these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences they know what they want yet temper it with responsibility but almost always it s impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster and it s these episodes that make american pie such a carnal delight to watch 
it s an interesting premise our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real in truth our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains what we see what we do everything around us is nothing more than a computer generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence our bodies severely atrophied are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet the sci fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along the matrix isn t it the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network a sham world the ability to plug one s brain into a computer has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator dark city and a few star trek episodes both classic and next generation what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought provoking keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo who is plucked out of the artificial world known as the matrix by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines the group s leader morpheus laurence fishburne has chosen neo because he believes neo is the one who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence from the beginning of the film we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out this in a lesser movie would be annoying but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun what is reality what is a sham the film turns our very perception of life on its side more than once we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality or live a life of relative bliss oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings as viewers this is intriguing enough so imagine what it would be like for neo and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves reeves whom i ve never really cared for as an actor is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness and little subtlety he was good in speed for example but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely so much of my expectation was happily for naught in a couple of places the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature and this is a heavy credit to writers directors andy and larry wachowski i mean since bill and ted s excellent adventure what movie could you say really utilized keanu reeves more interesting than reeves is fishburne who s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions and convincingly so very surprising for a sci fi movie fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout as if he always knows what to expect this helps to further the aura of his character s proficiency and extensive knowledge hugo weaving as agent smith one of the artificial intelligence s anti intruder programs is also good playing his deadpan no nonsense kick ass role which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time unfortunately when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row the nature of his character s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive carrie anne moss plays trinity morpheus s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo although her character is somewhat inconsistent moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn t in the picture there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects many methods of imagery are employed from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics of special note is the use of the freeze and turn effect where the entire scene is frozen turned then continued from a new angle this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi circle with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends the motion cameras film the action and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second pretty slick the matrix drips with style from the clothing to the music to the action we re watching an exaggerated version of what we re used to much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film there s a lot of kung fu there s a lot of gunplay when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion there s also the element of the japanese action cartoon called anime by aficionados especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects combined it s really like no live action film i have ever seen the film is not without its faults some of the scenes and ideas are borrowed a little too liberally from other films and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing some of the lines are also pretty bad in one instance a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying and it wasn t meant to be a joke however these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci fi film that for once does more than merely entertain 
to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie mulan is a whole new world the mouse factory s latest feature is a treasure featuring magnificent animation a strong story and finely drawn characters mulan is the story of a fiesty head strong young woman who unlike other disney heroines isn t seeking her prince charming mulan s motivations are simple to save her father serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation the emperor has called for a conscription one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation mulan s crippled father is called but mulan sneaks off steals his armor and takes his place mulan is a saga of courage and self discovery yet despite the grim backdrop of war it is a lively tale of self reliance and brain over brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian american talent as the voices for the main characters including the wonderful ming na wen the joy luck club as mulan b d wong as shang mulan s commanding officer and later love interest pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon tek oh as mulan s proud but loving father also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon sent by mulan s ancestors to watch over and help the young woman his fast wise cracking hip talking mushu may seem out of place but it s a crowd pleasing performance especially for the youngsters the movie features only a couple of songs fewer than most previous disney animated flicks but mulan s are winners the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus mulan is a treat more powerful than hercules with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame at about minutes mulan moves rapidly and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain also it is hoped that the success of mulan and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them committed to lifelong learning through effective communication 
mars attacks c jack nicholson glenn close annette bening martin short danny devito rod steiger pierce brosnan sarah jessica parker michael j fox jim brown pam grier joe don baker natalie portman christina applegate lisa marie tom jones this is director tim burton s finest film to date many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day but even though the stories are similar they really are two distinctly different films however as a whole mars attacks is much more entertaining than id and i loved id you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film it is completely wacked out and unlike anything you ve ever seen once the silly tone of the film is set it s easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don t mix the plot is simple martians invade the earth but it s different than any other invasion film usually it s the evil aliens versus the heroic humans this time however it s the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans the martians who are all computer generated are just about the funniest things i ve seen in a long time they look funny they move funny and their language is hilarious and about the special effects the effects in mars attacks are just about the most flawless ones i ve seen to date the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem real there are just a couple of scenes that don t work mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship also glenn close overacts tremendously in her thankfully very limited screen time so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise but there are many big laughs in the film as i said if you are in the right mood could it have been funnier certainly was it funny enough yes was i entertained absolutely on a personal note i d like to thank whomever cast rod steiger my favorite actor in the film as war crazy general decker finally after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see while he s not given the type of role that you can give a real performance in he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him 
no humans were harmed tested or tasted in the making of this film all recipes are fictions twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul director writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive this true story briefly mentioned in the shining has no turned into a minutes long motion picture in the united states was a land of pioneers of gold starved americans making their way west it was a period of manifest destiny the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could capt john boyd guy pearce has become both a hero and a victim during this period of relentless consumption in ways he could never have imagined boyd s journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california upon his arrival he is greeted by a small motley group of soldiers including his commanding officer hart jeffrey jones a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life toffler jeremy davies the fort s personal emissary to the lord knox stephen spinella the veterinarian that plays doctor who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn t like reich neal mcdonough the no nonsense soldier of the group and the seriously over medicated cleaves david arquette a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions into this cold bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger colqhoun robert carlyle a half starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound seeking refuge in a cave they soon ran out of food and were forced to consume one another colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d oeuvre himself our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors and colqhoun tags along to help out soon it becomes clear that colqhoun s tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive it involves an old indian myth called weendigo which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person s strength spirit and very essence his hunger becomes an insatiable craving the more he eats the more he wants and the stronger he becomes there can never be enough and death is the only escape it s all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through as professionally made as the movie is you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this teen age horror fans won t care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit but they ll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces but jokes aside this is a film that is well worth watching it has wonderful and mature characters that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end the two main characters are also the most interesting boyd is a simple honest man tiered of war killing and fear his sacred wish is to live a normal quite life away from gunpowder and blood colqhoun is different he proves that a man on the brink of death would do anything to stay alive including sacrificing his own soul he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen the atmosphere in ravenous is macabre and bizarre scary and surreal completely isolated from the rest of the world stands fort spencer here time stands still and nothing changes the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life men that are nothing and has nothing to loose the result is some sort of cabin fever cannibalism is more like a sick game for them since they find no pleasure in living they find some excitement in killing and dying it s like who s going to die first the unchangeable icy landscape where birds do not sing and even wind doesn t move the leaves on the trees resembles kubrick s the shining it s hard to not get mad here one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters and starts to understand them although they have turned into half crazed killers music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere a strange musical score composed by michael nyman the piano and damon albarn that often seems out of place and in complete contrast to the image somehow reflects the characters twisted reactions on the world and their situation the director herself stated that it was ok to laugh during the picture and i must admit that it is often very funny in a strange way such as the wonderful quote it s lonely being a cannibal you don t get that many friends or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin saying eat to live don t live to eat but mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change every actor does a great job especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier nagged by his undeserved honor this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan s interview with the vampire actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies since the topics are so alike ravenous starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring however these little failures don t diminish the impression this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone s soul a dark side which we re all trying to hide but it s there always it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since the shining i said no food i didn t say there was nothing to eat colqhoun ravenous 
if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton chop sideburns to each side of his head spoken with a thick irish accent and tried his damnedest to play it straight he wouldn t have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in i went down gleeson who s not dissimilar to the late saturday night live alumnus in terms of physical attributes plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film bunny is sent to county cork to retrieve one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle bunny is to accompany git hynes peter mcdonald recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies that tom french is a mean bollocks he wants frank back and a small matter of some that tom s wife was supposed to have given to frank for this he won t break anyone s thumbs maybe inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach i went down follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs dimly lit pubs and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity the butcher boy even if you can t comprehend half of what they re saying gleeson and mcdonald together make i went down a trip worth taking the film is in many ways reminiscent of another little independent feature s highway that film too was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson s tale whimsical observations on life carefully crafted vignettes deadpan conversational asides and scenes that ll make you laugh out loud witness the episode in which our good natured protagonists bind frank played by peter caffrey to a hotel bed leaving him with only the tv remote for company that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in highway what s also charming about i went down is how the relationship between buddy and git develops their trip becomes an education for both of them but the way it s handled is neither sappy nor labored the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation via flashbacks of the relationship between frank and tom it s a little too hollywood and what makes i went down so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies sure it s gritty make that grubby but it s also pretty goofy although i went down emphasizes the comedic elements of dis organized crime there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter don t let these deter you though i went down is a little gem it s only playing at one philadelphia area theater and i suspect it won t be there for long so catch it while you can 
good films are hard to find these days great films are beyond rare proof of life russell crowe s one two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller is one of those rare gems a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting an intelligent script and masterful directing together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days genuine motivation in a story that rings true consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan s character in the film all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world i haven t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah s masterpiece the getaway but enough with the gossip let s get to the review the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman david morse an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti government soldiers upon discovering his identity the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for million the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off and no one will step forward with the money with no choice available to her bowman s wife alice ryan hires terry thorne crowe a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative to arrange the return of her husband but when things go wrong as they always do in these situations terry and his team which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year david caruso take matters into their own hands the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character driven vehicle filled with well written dialogue shades of motivation and convincing acting by all the actors the script is based on both a book the long march to freedom and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap ransom situations and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy screenwriter of the devil s advocate and dolores claiborne the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan but that between crowe and david caruso dug out from b movie hell caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe s right hand gun while providing most of the film s humor ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic gunslinger character of terry thorne the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes the bulk of those scenes which bookend the movie work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story s characters the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise director taylor hackford mixes both his old school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film proof of life is a thinking man s action movie it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war and the sacrifices one makes for those choices the sacrifices that help you sleep at night 
losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare while we all might feel the desire to blow someone s head off with a shotgun when they don t seem to grasp our point of view actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid this isn t the case with sam baily john travolta s slightly askew average joe persona in mad city i don t think people listen to guys like me sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum just a few days ago sam was a guard at this same museum but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position sam s apprehension resulted in a brash decision in an effort to get his ex boss museum director mrs banks blythe danner to just listen he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage sam s overall concern is valid enough if he loses his job his paycheck his benefits etc his wife and two children won t be provided for he s not a lunatic or a hot tempered madman he s somewhat like a child panicky compulsive and running on emotion and his naive intentions aren t helped any by the fact that banks wasn t overly compassionate with the let go overall he s just like you and me except that he has the capacity to view the line we d deem far enough as the starting mark of some crazy race meanwhile television reporter max brackett dustin hoffman is also on the scene covering a fluff story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest breaking news story he ever could ve hoped for having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting max is anxious to turn this into his and only his story max immediately bonds with sam max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone at first max s intentions don t stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor but as he gets to know sam more personally he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him the media however is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill the accidental shooting of ex co worker cliff bill nunn a black security guard becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam s honest ambitions also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts head of the news department of the station max falls directly under and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander who uses his network power to try and outshine max alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities then there is mia kirshner who plays the young tv station intern laurie she falls under max s wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting kirshner s credits are relatively small for now including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow still kirshner s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda bitchy in a reserved way roles i wouldn t mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy self righteous monster has indeed been tackled before mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors and seeing them together is a real treat they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both there is quite a bit of humor in this film and without it it could ve fallen into a drab cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause this isn t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart but it will lightly touch both making for a recommendable movie if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time i urge you to check this one out

i can hear the question already what on earth do these two movies have in common to most people not a lot except that both are by renowned directors as i saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers but oh how differently the packages affect their films while everyone s production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campion s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is i left everyone says i love you not remembering a lot about who loved whom but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face i left the portrait of a lady not remembering a lot about who loved whom and i could have cared less everyone features nothing allen hasn t done before storywise woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman roberts and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong again similar situations happen to his family and friends some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his early funny films the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of take the money and run his directorial debut however nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one of a kind display of sheer good spirits in fact in this movie the feeling itself is what s most important yes the movie would have been better among his very best i think if it had a meatier story but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling and what better way to express feeling than through music love is often best expressed in a song and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart some are a tad too goofy such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor but i admired allen for even putting them in there it also helps that as usual allen has a top flight cast working with him their singing voices range from quite good goldie hawn to not quite good allen to literally unlistenable barrymore whose real voice was dubbed by a professional but while their vocal abilities differ all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen and making it rub off on the audience granted some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies but for those attuned to it this film should work wonders jane campion too has a top flight cast working for her in portrait of a lady too but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted virtually lifeless mess albeit a visually interesting one campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye filling images that linger in the mind unfortunately what didn t linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people even worse i don t find myself feeling bad that i ve forgotten the problem i think lies not with the cast which seemed to be trying very hard for the material it was the script that couldn t convince me to care about anyone the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion but i found no reason to connect with any of them i understood that the story was about cold emotionally vacant characters but for me to care about them i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives jones script never simply gave me that opportunity in the end it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes unfortunately as she kept painting these dazzling pictures they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film in the end the movie s one strength ended up hurting it so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them why with both films my head cared about neither story but only everyone says i love you was able to make my heart sing 
it s no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office a poorly written script can be bested by a superb acting corps and a well written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs in directing his latest action comedy director brett ratner money talks takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get out buddy cop movie in addition rush hour serves as a first class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types the two lead names share equal screen time here mostly because they spend it together jackie chan in his first completely american production makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago knock off stands no chance against the content of this one chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise and there s no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn t believe their eyes the first time chris tucker on the opposite side relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan s performance he works perfectly with the script and it s quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines almost essential to the action genre the plot is nonexistent we re quickly introduced to detective james carter tucker is a maverick officer for the lapd cut forward to another scene where the daughter julia hsu of the american chinese consul tzi ma is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters the fbi is quick to the rescue but the consul insists that one of his men detective inspector lee chan be brought on the case to help the fbi resists but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective it s here that carter and lee hook up and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up but it doesn t quite reach the top tier of action comedies like last year s grosse pointe blank there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan this might be a major drawback also some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride and others are there simply to look menacing however none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another whether it s tucker s toned down routine or chan s tight rein on his action sequences and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types a recommendable visit to the theater indeed 
bob the happy bastard s quickie review the matrix what s worse than y k how about a fully digital future where nothing is real that s what computer programmer neo keanu reeves slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix a movie directed by the wachowski brothers the guys behind the hip thriller bound before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role hold on there s actually a story with depth here it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss who looks quite cool in leather i must say neo reeves is pretty much a key player in this fight although he really doesn t look it at first could this amateur be the one as fisburne thinks he is credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build something that few special effects laden films seem to do these days there s plenty of effects to go around of course but at least there s a backbone to build them on as well reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy yet great i wish the villains weren t quite so generic leftover g men from looking for a sweet sci fi actioner with plenty of stop motion swooping camera angles and of course a motherlode of a helicopter explosion now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project bring it on 
we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist years later we see his subsequent resurfacing in the mid s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown based on the life story of david helfgott this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child genius compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father in the s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy the film traces his relationship with his father whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys david is offered places in the usa but his father refuses to let him leave australia the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher s house he is well lit via the external house lights his teacher isn t home we pull back and see that the dark front room s window has it s curtains open there in a pool of blackness is a grand piano david s fall over the dark cliff has begun instead of being told in a linear mode shine jumps around in time ala pulp fiction this narrative device works well we see david as a boy teenager in london and mental patient in various snippets the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion adult helfgott s return to the light is told in linear fashion the lead role is played by different actors with the teenage david taylor and adult david rush standing out whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia i think this is his first major cinema work his david whilst clearly damaged he keeps quoting his daddy in a babbling word torrent cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts is both touching and funny taylor s teenage david is the more sympathy producing role we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov s rd whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects one scene has adult helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice with a clever subtlety the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping but of the same beat the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd but it s us being clapped we are young david walking up to the stage for our first public show the music as you would expect from a film of this subject matter is critical and it works very well the miming of the actors piano playing is faultless apparently rush didn t mime he really did play helfgott s life is certainly not without it s sympathetic people indeed his return to the normal world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft it shows that with the help of god we can all find our way back home 
the premise of the new teen targeted horror film final destination causes a recollection of a memorable simpsons halloween episode after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time machine after a trek into the cretaceous period homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world again and again homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it the characters of final destination have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence their design someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake that someone is death you see alex browning devon sawa and six others have cheated the grim reaper but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve for a high school excursion alex s french class is traveling to paris by airline transport alex tense and neurotic has a shocking premonition after boarding he sees the plane and every passenger on it spontaneously explode in mid air in a panic of sheer lunacy alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft after a handful of others including one teacher follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane the unwitting survivors watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize but death won t be cheated so easily and one by one the survivors of flight are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi before i delve into the meat of the review i d just like to confer is that one helluva premise or what final destination creepy beyond rational comprehension probably reads more like an unsettling x files episode than the simpsons therefore the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong on familiar turf the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong and the opening minutes of final destination reflects that unlike most thrillers the set up is crisp and cool you just deeply sincerely hope that the momentum won t unspool leaving us with a second string effort with nothing but cheap derivative shocks young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration what with i know what you did last summer and sequel idle hands and a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil urban legend after the set up when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair i started to really have fun with final destination low and behold a teen thriller that is actually unsettling actually suspenseful and yes actually intelligent some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside this film is among the most refreshing and all out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting edge scream in final destination stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood spattered slasher crap we ve endured throughout the past few years not that the characters are that good sawa

kristin cloke aside from alex the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter varsity blues playing an abstract character named clear rivers what were her parents thinking the personality of clear is written with such a vague nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash card saying hello i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character s plight toss a few stereotypical fbi agents daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith and a ummm spiritual mortician former candyman tony todd into the mix and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing dicing and assorted disembowelments not so final destination has no slicing and dicing or at least none dealt by a human killer and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying murderer on the loose concept with assistance from a shrewd intelligently paced screenplay by morgan wong and jeffrey reddick the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity listen up reindeer games but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of final destination is the murder scenes creative resourceful and breathlessly inventive the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character s demise what will trigger the accident will it be the john denver record just put on to play rocky mountain high yeah sick humor will it be the leaking toilet the falling fishing reel in the corner the murders are startling and largely unforeseen including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes but who cares it s fun in that simple regard final destination is my cup of tea this stylishly executed thriller although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side after the show it will also have an frightening impact on you when will your design expire is death waiting around the corner the final effect is a major case of the heebie jeebies 
i remember making a pact right after patch adams to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality but darn it music of the heart is just layered with feel good material and bright characterizations it s hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it s manipulation in addition it s also a terrific family film this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools it could also be described as mrs streep s opus yes meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari and that brings both good news and bad out of the gate possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta s character and grasp her academic point of view she is very strict with her students but what insight does that create into the story slowly but surely we begin to recognize the intentions of the character and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied one thoroughly interesting fact about music of the heart lies with the unlikely presence in the director s chair horror veteran wes craven after leaving an impression with the scream films and the original nightmare on elm street craven has attempted a precarious cross over to drama at first his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material it doesn t carry the heart warming courage of mr holland s opus but music of the heart is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate yes oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep but it s the solid ensemble cast that makes music of the heart work angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn t hire roberta because of her lack of experience blue eyed adian quinn is endearing as always playing a new love interest gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second grade teacher and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force it s like a schoolteacher s version of thelma and louise in a restrained but effective manner the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari s teaching of violin there s some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman in it s dramatic build up the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth it s a good movie for anyone to see although missing out on the experience would not be a life altering decision it s commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross over and also for achieving his intricate goal watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments who may ask yourself this is the guy who directed scream of course when the third installment of that series comes around in february with craven directing you may find yourself wondering this is the guy who directed music of the heart mission accomplished wes thankfully there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film in it s entirety it s a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile the child actors are cute and perform up to par even if some of their problems are clich d and predictable in the extreme the mother who doesn t want her son to be learning white man s music the unexpected casuality basically everything is there it doesn t strike the perfect chord but music of the heart is highly convincing the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better but music of the heart is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals 
meet joe black reviewed on nov starring brad pitt anthony hopkins claire forlani in meet joe black brad pitt plays death that s all that really needs to be said but nevertheless i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description death decides to take a holiday what with all the rigors of soul collecting and all and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it s like to be human death assumes the body of brad pitt and from there much trouble ensues for one thing death as pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter played by claire forlani obviously this enrages hopkins because really what can death offer besides eternal damnation of course there is also a sub plot about forlani s ex boyfriend she dumps him for pitt trying to take over hopkins company meet joe black runs just under three hours i ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics meet joe black is neither historical nor is it an epic though i get the feeling martin brest the director desperately wants it to be every single scene in the movie goes on about minutes too long and the ending takes about minutes longer than it really should a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent instead of just good which is what it is pitt an actor i normally loathe is actually quite engaging as death i believed his performance and i could see why forlani s character would fall in love with him i have to agree with roger ebert though who found it hard to believe that an entity that s been around for all time wouldn t know what peanut butter was that has nothing to do with pitt s performance of course but it is a little distracting hopkins gives his usual excellent performance he s able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left without making him an obnoxious whiner and in her first major studio role claire forlani is surprisingly good she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her so meet joe black is a good movie hampered by it s ridiculous running time had the film been cut by an hour or so i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review 
why do so many children s films treat their target audience with utter contempt too many of those who write or direct for children s movies assume that the kids just can t handle serious thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues the iron giant which was directed and co written by brad bird late of such animated series as the simpsons and king of the hill assumes that not only can children handle such discussions but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time the iron giant holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience making it a film that s enjoyable for both children and adults alike hogarth hughes voice of eli marienthal is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard working single mother annie jennifer aniston in a small town in maine after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception he comes across a giant robot vin diesel from space that eats metal for food after saving the robot nicknamed the iron giant from electric shock hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts because of damage he suffered upon landing the giant has forgotten what his original mission was so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy realizing he can t just keep the giant in a barn all the time and that the giant needs food he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean harry connick jr an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can t keep the giant a secret forever because a government spook named kent mansley christopher mcdonald has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant and takes up residence in hogarth s house as a lodger meanwhile the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind the iron giant is exactly what family films ought to be because it doesn t talk down to its audience the story is simple very simple about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy it s very similar to the spielberg classic e t and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of the iron giant the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg s film such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy the film delivers several serious messages the most important of which is one s ability to choose one s own fate hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be a hero the final sequence is touching and appropriate though i won t give it away i will say that very few will be disappointed the animation while not up to disney standards what could be after tarzan is good enough to make you forget you re watching a cartoon the giant is computer animated while the human characters are all hand drawn the old fashioned way the characters faces are done quite well drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother harry connick jr does a nice characterization as dean and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney of tv s frasier as an army general called in by agent mansley unlike several cartoon features each character is actually a developed personality rather than a stereotype and is actually integral to the plot rather than being a superfluous comic relief sidekick a clich disney still hasn t ditched dean for example could have been a stereotypical beatnik his character profile seems to suggest that but he is presented as a character with real emotions thoughts and motivations even the heavy agent mansley is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to but out of his own fear and paranoia a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper thin stereotypes and figure the kids won t mind but the iron giant has clearly put a little work into making the characters real and it pays off the film isn t only around to deliver heavy handed messages though it s also very funny and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things such as dive into a pool are handled well and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing having worked on the simpsons for many years a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to outlast one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed and also extremely clever the film even takes some jabs at america s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to duck and cover in the event of a nuclear attack the iron giant has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing instead of seeing people get bonked on the head we get well timed clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with when you get right down to it the iron giant is no more than the story of a boy and his robot the story is so straightforward so quaint that it ultimately becomes charming though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person when it comes to family entertainment simple is the way to go it s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word but it s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind but rather the elements that go into the story namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue which the iron giant has in spades 
carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town she goes to college in california there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore who is a city boy when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving she brings shore with her and her parents lane smith and cindy pickett are less than thrilled dan gauthier gugino s boyfriend from high school proposes to gugino gugino isn t ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end forget jurassic park cliffhanger the firm and last action hero son in law is the film to see this summer son in law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers especially fans of the wiez when son in law is long gone and forgotten the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen although the basic story line has been done many many times before the film is still fun to watch the laughs are plentiful especially when the wiez is around the way some of the jokes are done are new even though some of the jokes are old there are also several new jokes that at least i haven t seen before still when presented right even old material can be funny still this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn t contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price the cast for this film does an excellent job pauly shore encino man is the star attraction of this film he is great and knows how to entertain the audience pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl she makes her character believable on some levels yet interesting at the same time the person who played the grandfather mason adams i believe also does a great job the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen patrick renna who played gugino s little brother was a little annoying but no where as near as macaulay culkin and for only part of the time so i can forgive him tiffani amber thiessen a killer among friends saved by the bell does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television she wasn t given overly much to do in the film but what she had she does a good job with 
i can sum up first strike in one word awesome never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he s ever appeared in he should be awarded greatly the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan s rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well however first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three for the simple reason that practice makes perfect his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great like rumble this film is about the mafia the former kgb now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men the trailer for the film sums it up quite well first strike is action packed but the fight scenes are so fast and furious they almost have a witty italian like humor to them jackie chan is a regular comedian well he s no eddie murphy but he can really crack you up for example he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him as he claims to be the korean that s secret agent james bond even the plot to this film improved above the others as a sort of twisted nuclear weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame but never fear as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident with some of the most high flying stunts and side splitting comedy first strike is a sure fire hit that s guaranteed to draw some major world wide attention 
with his last two films shine and snow falling on cedars australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there and his latest hearts in atlantis is no different its structure beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle is similar to the green mile which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books the parallels don t end there either atlantis was adapted by william goldman who had previously penned the big screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king s dreamcatcher even the film s content is a bit reminiscent of mile in fact it s the perfect blend of the feel good s nostalgia of stand by me also by king and mystical power hokum of mile king s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories but the main focus here is on the first and longest tale called low men in yellow coats the film s title comes from the second chapter it s set in harwich connecticut where year old bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in a boarding house run by his cold self centered mother elizabeth hope davis joe gould s secret who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son bobby spends his time with his two closest friends john sullivan will rothhaar and tomboy carol gerber mika boorem who become something like the kevin paul and winnie of harwich when a new tenant moves into the vacant room the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan anthony hopkins hannibal a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers i won t go into what these powers are but they re considerably toned down from the book and don t involve black stuff flying out of ted s mouth a la mile atlantis present day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel s final chapter titled heavenly shades of night are falling and features david morse in yet another connection to the green mile as a married middle aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks cedars which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski the oscar nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski s red the acting is solid from everyone including hopkins who never once makes you think of dr lecter most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem who both had tiny parts in along came a spider while i didn t really have much of a problem with goldman s screenplay i do need to point out at least one inconsistency goldman for those of you who don t read premiere writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else s films carefully explaining why they all suck make no sense and insult their audiences while somehow failing to mention the crap that he s penned like the general s daughter it s mean spirited but fun to read mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business including michael jackson o j and robert blake in atlantis which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back well he s not and it doesn t make sense pg for violence and thematic elements 
i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean s war picture i still think that it doesn t deserve being the number in the american film institute s list of the greatest american movies and i think that lumet s angry men wilder s witness for the prosecution and kubrick s paths of glory would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in but i can t deny the importance of the bridge on the river kwai cinematically and in its contents the film is set in burma in a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai but the british commanding officer colonel nicholson alec guinness insists corresponding to the geneva conventions that his officers needn t work as simple workmen struggling toughly col nicholson forces the japanese commandant col saito sessue hayakawa to give way in this respect afterwards col nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge he considers it an opportunity to raise his men s morale and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge among them the american shears william holden an escapee from the japanese prison camp and the british major warden jack hawkins a flaw of the picture is the clich d characterization of the japanese people they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge and the film doesn t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in paths of glory lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies this is also perceptible in the conversations between col nicholson and col saito in this regard it is symptomatic that shears who doubts the military logic is a somehow unpleasant person in the film the audience is supposed to applaud col nicholson s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col nicholson takes for his men the plot by passes these risks that means the picture isn t perfect but it has a lot of virtues as well it shows the madness of war and what war can produce in people s minds it shows how col nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others like shears get cynics and the bridge on the river kwai is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti war film despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme david lean s effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense especially in the dramatic though not wholly plausible showdown alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character the other actors deliver very good performances as well jack hildyard s fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses c karl rackwitz klein k ris germany 
mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv show er her mast famous episode love s labour lost dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood s big blockbuster movies so it s only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster and i have to say after a shaky beginning she does not disappoint peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists which is obviously nothing new the first half hour goes into detail way too much detail about how the weapons are stolen despite a few good images including a train collision and a very impressive explosion none of this was very coherent it s long and drawn out and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture it begins to take off george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two but that is dispensed with quickly the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm frustration determination and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self doubt this is when leder starts to show her true stuff she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city s crowded streets and a madman with a nuke walking among them mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero you re not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her george clooney is a real movie star many of you may have hated him as batman but this guy is for real he has a natural screen presence and an ingratiating personality he ll be around for a while dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker 
books could be and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy and rightfully so this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late s early s inspiring literally dozens of clones from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre the special effects were groundbreaking revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it and now george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday s star wars updated with today s special effects wizardry either way the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen where it rightfully deserves to be seen can there be anyone in the world who doesn t know what star wars is about in a way star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it it s a story about a young man s coming of age a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire a tale of swashbuckling and derring do the likes of which haven t been seen on the silver screen in decades strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world it s high adventure incredible special effects and well it s just an experience something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation and it s about to do so again this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film s devoted fans who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now interviews trailers leaks from within lucasfilm all of these have been collected collated and placed on webpages for people to see pages such as http www islandnet com corona films details sw html or my personal favorite http leopard cs latrobe edu au koukoula pictures of before and after have been placed side by side even months before the movies were released fans were making comparisons in some cases the changes were nothing less than phenomenal and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original for instance in my personal favorite example the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep moss covered carvings and etchings and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling booming city with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing all the starships and fighters are now computer animated getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made and they look fantastic four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in simply couldn t do it justice however much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself the negatives badly damaged by the ravages of time were brightened and returned to their original splendor the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt into glorious booming theater shaking full thx dolby digital stereo and that more than the added scenes or new special effects is where the real value of this new version lies it s really true what they say in the commercials star wars loses so much on the small screen even letterboxing doesn t make up for the decrease in size and definition in regard to the star wars special edition and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released i ll make this final recommendation go and see it go and see it more than once it may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it s gone this time take along the youngsters who ve never had the big screen star wars experience you ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time there s magic in this movie special edition or no there can be no denying that it s still star wars and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages from four to four hundred let s all return to that time long ago and that galaxy far far away 
seen april at p m at crossgates cinema guilderland n y theater by myself for free using my hoyts critic s pass theater rating very good seats sound and picture do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you ve just become part of a story everyone has their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but a part nevertheless that seems to be the basic theory behind go where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn t usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them such as a teenage supermarket cashier a bottom of the drug food chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors these types of characters might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father a mid level drug dealer a narc obsessed with multi level marketing horny wedding guests a zen lovemaker two shrimp scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out how they will all come together is the process the film deals with i d imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general the film starts out as anything else with little indication of what s to come we meet ronna polley a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn t seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent she s not very charming especially to her customers but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works maybe this is because she s not a very afeminite character but she s far from masculine a creative character indeed things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences this agreement starts a three pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death nearly the same can be said for two other characters zack mohr and adam wolf who we don t think much of when they first appear as supporting characters but later will become major players to the film s makeup another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene it s clear this film isn t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling considering how good it is up until that point it s a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today and so the film begins to take shape first by following ronna and her friends on a one night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which doesn t exactly go as planned but that s what keeps it all so interesting the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna s story but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead simon and his three friends head to vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined the third arc about zack and adam again overlaps with ronna s story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle we re shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren t even their fault they just happened to be where they were when they were i d really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven t seen the film perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking still i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well direction trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman it s a great accomplishment he doesn t just depict a story he wraps us up in it all pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general it s clear the script has been inspired by many sources with both obvious and subtle references yet it never screams rip off tone mood where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre it s not overly dark or twisted and the comedy isn t so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy more like macabre light cinematography art direction able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture we re able to get a sense of who they are what they re thinking and how they came to be in their situations even when their actions are surprising it never seems very out of synch performances every actor nails their role see above theme theory the film doesn t seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages instead it s more of a philosophical experiment in fact it might not have meant to do that intentionally but there definitely is something existential to it all and to think that go is just a big comedy and adventure see also the big lebowski clerks jackie brown pulp fiction true romance also by liman swingers 
the postman delivers but not first class the postman a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman warning my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps

the rest of the film become a reluctant item although the postman knows he s running a fraud the concept of renewed communications sets the kids imagination afire especially ford lincoln mercury larenz tate his second in command and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists tyranny the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner although the movie appeals to my sensibilities there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted it s derivitive of costner s own waterworld and clint eastwood westerns there s little here that we haven t seen dozens of times before the film is often down right corny a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright eyed child is embarrassing in its slow motion banality the film s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor despite the film s excessive three hour length several things are never explained what was the war about how did civilization change so rapidly everyone has horses where did all they come from the law of eights that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film but where are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn t made their way west to help or conquer there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn t appear to make sense the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments but beyond that there are some oddities the evil army is called holnists which sounds coincidentally like the new age holism but why is it another coincidence that it takes place in just one year after many ancient prophesies including the ending of the mayan calendar predict a new world for mankind why is the general named bethlehem there seems to be some reason for that but what sometimes the movie feels like a joke an army of postal workers armed with guns considering the headlines of recent years it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys it s even more difficult to accept those re powering the federal government as the heroes given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government it s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film s nationalism even with its numerous flaws the movie all comes together if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have it s doubtful that the postman is going to find much of an audience but a few of us are going to have a good time besides we re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year millennium computer bug michael redman has written this column for over years and would like to announce that the michael redman arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is to the best of his knowledge not him perhaps this similarly named person should have used kevin costner s postal service 
 strange days chronicles the last two days of in los angeles as the locals gear up for the new millenium lenny nero ralph fiennes goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips he pines for his ex girlfriend faith juliette lewis not noticing that another friend mace angela bassett really cares for him this film features good performances impressive film making technique and breath taking crowd scenes director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it but as a whole this is an unsatisfying movie the problem is that the writers james cameron and jay cocks were too ambitious aiming for a film with social relevance thrills and drama not that ambitious film making should be discouraged just that when it fails to achieve its goals it fails badly and obviously the film just ends up preachy unexciting and uninvolving 
call for the cliche police if you must but the eyes are the window to the soul the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze paul newman ralph fiennes anthony hopkins morgan freeman you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds that the characters they play are real human beings we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor but he had that unique quality in his eyes in gridlock d an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire shakur and his co star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry shakur and roth play ezekiel spoon whitmore and alexander stretch rome two detroit buddies who share a spoken word jazz trio an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie thandie newton when a new year s eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time they soon make a new year s resolution to get into rehab but that proves to be easier said than done as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy confusion and red tape the government might be the least of their obstacles however as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer and on the run from a nasty thug vondie curtis hall in order for you to buy into gridlock d at all you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie they are going to government offices on new year s day in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all gridlock d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey s falling down which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles in falling down michael douglas d fens the character s personalized license plate echoed in gridlock d by the drug lord d reper s plates whips out a gun because he can t get breakfast at mcdonald s in gridlock d spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center and where the unhinged d fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences writer director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question do you expect the world to stop just because you picked today to clean up the world in gridlock d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system but perhaps not enough of them a significant chunk of gridlock d is devoted to spoon and stretch s flight from d reper and from the police and those sub plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments in one scene stretch scares off d reper by getting chummy with a police officer another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film s main events perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self destructive behavior oh the irony of it tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case and living the life to back it up in gridlock d shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction mostly it comes through those eyes eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch s pure appetite and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self destructiveness he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again which is as much an obstacle to spoon s goal as any agency or enemy gridlock d s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch helping spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him with friends like that spoon doesn t need enemies and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much the tragedy now is that we won t get more chances to see those eyes again

when star wars came out some twenty years ago the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars we see constellations meteor showers and cool space ships when han solo goes light speed the stars change to bright lines going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point cool october sky offers a much simpler image that of a single white dot traveling horizontally across the night sky was it really only forty years ago when sputnik was launched and that before then no satellites ever existed have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then technological achievement even though it was from the russians it sounds hokey but when that scene occurs near the beginning of october sky i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam played by jake gyllenhaal determined to make a dent in the space race he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket when lovely teacher miss riley played by laura dern suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair we know exactly who is going to win but the joy in a film like this is in the little details for example homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class if he has any strengths whatsoever it is an undeterring vision and a good organizer it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school who knows more about rocket science than he does it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property that is the entire coal mining town he must walk eight miles one way just to set up the rockets which will fail fail fail and fail again homer s dad is played by chris cooper a favorite actor of mine since lone star here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in matewan instead of organizing union rallies he is the head of the coal miners who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year note how multi dimensional his character is he is his son s last nemesis as one who most likely interferes with his son s dreams but he truly loves his son and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how through coal mining because of his character we can see how far we ve come the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us we don t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family the paradigm was shifting under the father s feet and he knew of no other life so october sky far from being merely a feel good inspirational film offers much food for thought and this is the best type of inspirational film the one that you take something with you btw the final image of the film is just as simple is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal moving white dot against the night sky background another commonplace image to be sure but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago 
slavery is bad after hundreds of years we ve finally figured that one out this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg s latest serious film during the late s a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery fifty three of them are stuffed into the la amistad from a spanish word for friendship by their new spanish owners freeing himself from his chains senge pieh djimon hounsou renamed cinque by his masters leads a bloody revolt after killing most of the crew the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home or so they think instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property if they are property who do they belong to their masters the spanish government salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship the us government the defendants are pawns in several games abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard want to free them but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause their lawyer roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees south carolina senator john c calhoun arliss howard pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states president martin van buren nigel hawthorne is willing to force the result towards his own political ends when the verdict looks to free the africans van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes even that doesn t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims at the urging of calhoun the president then appeals the case to the supreme court populated by a majority of slave owners this little known try finding it in any history text book incident from america s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court the slavery issue is easy pickin s for spielberg much like his shindler s list which followed jurassic park as this follows lost world the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose nazis and slave traders both treat groups of others as less than human it s not hard to see who the bad guys are without that question to ponder the director s job is more difficult he has to make the story interesting spielberg succeeds for the most part the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle there are very few people in the tale in fact cinque is the only character who is fleshed out tappan and joadson are abolitionists symbols but not humans van buren is a weak politician but nothing else the rest of the slaves barely exist other than dressing for the set like many other films about people of color almost all the major players are white the film s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou the former model s first major role is a winner without speaking more than five words of english he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog the other stand out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents he also played the title role in nixon the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court room drama ever on the screen there are some other great moments especially impressive are the african s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant as grand as the epic is it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four star film michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some films 
big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america o j simpson tom capano the menendez brothers all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms and of course courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood whether it be john grisham s thrilling novels or television s famous dramas the courtroom has always provided big bucks so when i rented a civil action i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat however what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected a major surprise but fortunately a pleasant one john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it no one expected him to light up the screen in grease nor in saturday night fever but whenever he gets knocked down he always seems to come back fighting a civil action is not john s best performance but a strong one that could rival any performance in travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations his performance is not flashy nor memorable just solid if he delivered the only solid performance this film would still be average luckily he has a strong supporting cast william h macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood he continues to deliver great performances one after the other but he is still regarded as a secondary actor in a civil action he delivers yet another great performance as travolta s paranoid and greedy accountant he is not a lovable character but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film he is not one of the big time lawyers just a measly accountant but he delivers one of the best supporting roles of but there is actually someone better in a civil action robert duvall is also an underrated actor he gets many leading roles but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks brad pitt and jim carrey duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co defendant duvall is magical in this role he is the wise teacher who not only battles it out in the courtroom but also manages to teach every major player a lesson in his own twisted way in many non comedic films directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy to keep the audience on their toes unfortunately they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny jar jar binks anyone however this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed this is not the case in a civil action they have comedy coming from all sides whether it be duvall s inane questions or macy s sharp anger the laughs come in a steady pace granted it s not roll in the aisle funny but it provides a nice addition to the film the plot is terrific somewhat the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom then the case that will make or break jan travolta s career rears its ugly head they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it however budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt i will not spoil the rest although i must speak of the one downside to the film the courtroom debates are great but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored it left me somewhat confused although the rest of the film is terrific all in all john travolta is back yet again in this great film his supporting cast consisting of macy and duvall turn in tremendous performances which ease the load on travolta the film is smart witty and thought provoking not only does it gauge in court battles but also the various tolls it can take on the major players a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves 
it s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but by god american history x does it and for that i commend it it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo nazi skinhead a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who s not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off the subject of this film is one of them but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack he s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage and then in another brilliant stroke justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks he s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process his name is derek vinyard and he s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as say malcom x when we first see him he s clean shaven with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast a devlish goatee and he s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets at least when he doesn t need them he so believes in his convictions that he s willing to put his beliefs to the test even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison if only for a couple years american history x is about derek how he became a neo nazi skinhead how he rose to power how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself and how he tried to save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake we see him at all of these stages as a smart teenager a vicious hate monger a man having an epiphany and the man who tries to correct what he s done before and in all of these we get a portrait of a man from all sides or at least that s the intention the film s framing device is his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about also now a skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brooks who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek s deep space is trying to correct him when the film opens danny has just written a book report on mein kampf landing him in trouble with sweeney which causes him to make him write a paper on derek s life and how it has gotten him nowhere coincidentally this day is the day derek is released from prison and when we see him he s cleaned up not as buff and has a full head of hair he s just as intelligent but still very rough along the edges but he s wisened up he s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews and tries to persuade danny who s becoming what derek was before to give up his lifestyle but danny won t he goes to a large skinhead beer bash meets with the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo nazi dom as he was for it a couple of years ago the film circles around this then spins off into non linear flashbacks all done in black and white we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead living in venice beach organizing vicious and quasi sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white middle class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on to them the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop and he not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but he backs everything up with political reasons justifying their rage at least to them and frighteningly enough much of what he says sounds true american history x is a collection of really great scenes and moments rather than a cohesive great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next in it there are some of the best scenes i ve seen all year one scene features a dinner between derek s family and his mother s newest boyfriend played with reserve by eliott gould a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek s rightist views launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience gould s reaction to derek s final summation is unnerrving another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co worker guy torry while folding laundry in prison and another soon to be classic is actually divided in two the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year there s much more to appreciate like the acting which is uniformly good with stand outs coming from avery brooks beverly d angelo as the long suffering mother and gould who has one horrible line but other than that comes off with the best performance he s given in what seems like a really long time norton walks off with the film though coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble in only the fifth movie of his career norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation and maybe the best there s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing sadly enough this isn t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be it s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece the ending especially is pencilled in from other movies tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more and even the dramatic arc isn t as well travelled furlong s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view and when he decides to make a change by the end which was inevitable it doesn t seem like it has actually arrived there even derek s descent into skinhead dom doesn t seem justified though his fireman father william russ the dad from boy meets world and don t ask me how i know that is killed by a black junkie and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs as such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted to have his name removed sorta american history x is a very good movie and i was very moved by it but it could be a lot better and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential somewhere he claims there lies a tony kaye cut and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton who then ordered another cut and that is thus although he aimed for the directing credit to go to alan smithee the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director it wasn t allowed to him under the grounds that once you disown a film you can not badmouth it but really that s the macguffin no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval kaye s right in that it s not up to par even if he s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par this will not be a do the right thing for the late s yet it still gets its point across intelligently and backs it up with its story its message that one cannot be so enwrapped in one s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur is literally said over the narration unfortunately and even if it isn t perfect at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison and asks him if anything he s done has made his life any better it realy hits a nerve not only in derek but also in the audience 
bruce lee was a bigger than life martial artist and actor bruce s unique character i e self produced sound effects etc and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor james lee the story is told from his wife linda s point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee s life however you can t help but like whenever the fight scenes are on what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee s life before he became famous scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the all white students cheerleaders and athletes it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes in conclusion the movie was well made it produced a realization of who bruce lee was and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor and the fighting scenes were all excellent so go see it and enjoy the movie p s if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven

airplane is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film making after all it s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing directing teams even if most people don t recognize the names behind the films they are bound to recognize the titles airplane top secret the naked gun and hot shots to name a few but although the zucker abrahams zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in airplane remains the true cornerstone of their work and their directorial debuts in the seventies disaster films seemed to be at an all time high films like earthquake the towering inferno and the poseidon adventure were big hits there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane a series that spanned the entire decade and so in we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean it had to do with bad fish airplane is the story of ted striker robert hays an ex fighter pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six er seven comrades unable to stop living in the past ted s world fell apart he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job and eventually as we begin this film is getting dumped by his lover flight attendant elaine dickinson julie hagerty in a desperate attempt not to lose her ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working unfortunately she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her which leaves him wallowing in self pity in the midst of it all something happens someone gets sick then another then another soon the whole plane is full of deathly ill chicago bound people and when the pilots get sick played by peter graves kareem abdul jabbar and frank ashmore who will save the day gee i wonder of course the main draw here is the non stop whiz bang comedy with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags although i had seen this movie a few times before i was still laughing thru the entire thing the most fun character by far is the doctor played by leslie nielsen he s a dry subtle sterotypically straight faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film in a film like this you re not really expecting an elaborate production so one can t complain about the amateurish quality what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny played by stephen stucker this character is pointless nauseating and very unfunny i don t know why he was put in there and i don t think anybody will find a good excuse and when the film nears an end it slows down quite a bit almost getting old you gotta give it to a movie that only runs minutes and can feel two hours long aside from that airplane is really a top notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends especially if they haven t seen it and if they ask what the plot is just tell em it s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film but that s not important right now if you ve seen the film you ll understand 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff two girls and a guy is a film which is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girls carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and a great deal of dialogue embracing a near real time approach this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr toback for his bantering characters fortunately the film s cast is up to the challenge and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing the film s setup is fairly generic in nature and opens rather unpromisingly we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside a soho loft as they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy more indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation it s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride played with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is a cad all right but a captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the film s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others but by his own innate behaviour whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds carla lou and his unseen sickly mother it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show a typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the sparks begin to fly one of the great touches in the film is how blake when startled by carla s unannounced appearance begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag double teamed by the understandably aggrieved women who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declarations against their verbal jabs surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off limits for this film however it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length and it s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the film s tempo loses its liveliness the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequences fall flat subtle and not quite subtle allusions are made a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter long running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film mr toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc rating in favour of an r and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious if anything two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled from self assured to disconcerted yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr downey jr was arrested on drug charges and it s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character in a monologue to his mirrored reflection blake s self chiding to get his shit together is disquieting in its resonance while mr downey jr s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actresses are solid in more broadly observed roles ms graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actresses involving herself in three successive risky projects two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman she s quite appealing here playing a character at once both dainty and sultry meanwhile ms gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing she tones it down substantially as the film progresses but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox the film was reportedly shot in eleven days filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout two girls and a guy has an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one senses that mr toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it doesn t feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner two girls and a guy falls short of its potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr it s still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly as we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends i m an actor he tells them at one point using the ol tried and tested occupational hazard defense actors lie but not they all seem to agree denzel washington 
people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple techno thriller in such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked but i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff film directed by philip kaufman the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits but the right stuff film isn t even fiction it was based on the non fiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program the plot of the film begins in when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age in order to regain national prestige us government decides to be the first to send man into space best air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired all american image in one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top films made in s such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman s film looks quite atypical for its time with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for s and s age when hollywood used to make films larger than life but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation in s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies the right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risk taking artsy projects the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film the plot is almost non existent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts the film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty on the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases shepard s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean cut marine and future politician john glenn young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard kaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice president lyndon b johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman s superb direction most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world in that setting it s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights but the times are changing ww alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots their entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicity seeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman s superb use of poetic movie language editing is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space another fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period this film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws some of the mercury astronauts aren t fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure on the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long also some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan s america in some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early s time has passed now we don t see astronauts as heroes in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up but this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky and even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema 
this three hour movie opens up with a view of singer guitar player musician composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members all the rest displays a compilation of footage mostly from the concert at the palladium in new york city halloween other footage shows backstage foolishness and amazing clay animation by bruce bickford the performance of titties and beer played in this movie is very entertaining with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil frank s guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix i ve ever heard bruce bickford s outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with zooms morphings etc and actually it doesn t even look like clay it looks like meat 
one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable you know the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is sure it s been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on overused but always fun one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is but how it goes around giving its story this rule applies highly to kiss the girls there is something psychologically stimulating in a well crafted serial killer movie and kiss the girls is certainly well made however the whole film screams of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through well not only are the actors capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up unfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers one that seven a film a lot like this one knew not to make was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind i was waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery however credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film plotwise kiss the girls shows almost no originality we are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman a forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene at his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera has been missing for four days this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two and as a result we can t sympathize with detective cross however what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees before she is abducted dr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is a smart athletic woman and because of these traits becomes a target for casanova what the serial killer likes to call himself because of these character developing scenes we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods remembering that the killer gave her certain rules she decides to break one of them by calling out when casanova comes to punish her she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall after she is found she begins to help cross find his neice from this moment on kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive many people will compare this film to s seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but i presume that the similarities are intentional the screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet i don t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness the cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us sometimes a simple shot is the best one however many of the shots are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way the camera work is terrific but the editing makes this scene work so well the chaotic and mtv type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judd s character is experiencing however the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors morgan freeman is one of today s most powerful and believable actors detective cross is a very good character for him although it is just a similar one to the character in seven because of freeman s powerful presence he carries half the film by himself the other half is carried by ashley judd one of today s most promising dramatic actresses in fact her performance is better than freeman s if that is even possible her character is more original than freeman s and she handles it wonderfully we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast members do as much as they can with it cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina and unfortunately has scraps for a character tony goldwyn fairs slightly better but we don t really get to know his character either gina ravera gives a good performance but again she isn t in many of the scenes so as a result of all these small supporting parts the weight of the film lies on the two leads and they do a phenomenal job some of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year two other essential aspects of the film are quite good director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer he also doesn t handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have losing a lot of tension during many scenes however to his credit he does manage a terrific first half part of the blame falls on david klass i m sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more but klass focuses on the two main parts while this may give the two leads more screentime many of the small characters are one dimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girls always seems intelligent none of the conversations are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer i blame this mainly on the casting director because the killer s motive is because of rejection from women or so i assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friends is a shall we say big admirer of the killer kiss the girls is rated r for terror violence language and suggested sex with all the implausibilities of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain in fact i had the urge to see it again just for the performances the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through morgan freeman is possibly today s most convincing actor and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt i must also say that i loved the ending the showdown between good and evil was quite tense and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer perhaps it may not be possible but most of the film isn t anyway

in the muse albert brooks plays steven phillips a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio they claim that he s lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over so he turns to his best friend jack jeff bridges another screenwriter who s enjoyed success after success on the way over to jack s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman sharon stone into a cab and begins to think is he having an affair when confronted jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is in fact a muse a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity and has helped him garner his success she doesn t do any actual writing he is told but inspires you steven is excited by what he s hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she ll take steven on as a new client jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present preferably something from tiffany s after the meeting the muse sarah decides to take on steven but at a price she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her like bringing her salads in the middle of the night steven s wife andy macdowell sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon steven confesses everything and although at first suspicious she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he s going through for her and that s a question only time will tell the muse is albert brooks sixth film as writer director actor he co wrote with monica johnson and although it s a good movie it s not up to the level of his best works defending your life and mother the problem lies in the script and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor there aren t nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one liners it has a great premise but doesn t deliver up to it s full potential but i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit he may whine and complain but he just wants to support his family and be happy and i like sharon stone in this movie too it s a nice change of pace for her and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner james cameron and martin scorsese and although the muse doesn t have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman s the player i still left the theater feeling good and that s something i wish i got out of more movies 
in a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world and she was she was also build to be one of the most luxurious and that she was finally she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not to get a ticket for this voyage you either spent a life s savings to get to america to start life anew were part of the upper class and had the money to spare or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson jack dawson makes the trip and happens to be at the right place at the right time rose dewitt bukater a first class passenger climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue and a tale of death and tragedy this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia the movie titanic shows what happened maybe not with a degree of accuracy but it still shows it very realisticaly now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story it serves as both admirably brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is but that alone is not enough the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren t acting but are actually the characters in the movie the casting for the movie could really have been better in my humble opinion that is one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself yes you read correctly the ship is a character how is the titanic a character you ask well simple a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this mr cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp now to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening if your imagination is good the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique the movie will leave you amazed at the effects and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie just humans and an oversized ship the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end the historical value of this movie is quite high and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy for it is extremely well done the method of telling the story is also good maybe not totally unique but effective none the less regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing if you get the chance to see this movie go it might not be the best movie in the world but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it during none of the hours and minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie 
martin scorsese s kundun which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure personally i don t think it needs one it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do as a larger than life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal the set design and cinematography are outstanding and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans kundun does not it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative

 minutes not rated though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn t very well known to most american audiences but perhaps it should be oshii was the director of last year s best known japanese animated film import ghost in the shell and is known among fans of japanese animation or anime for making films with a deep philosophical bent one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series in its many incarnations graphic novels manga two different runs of made for video episodes original animation videos or oavs for short and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan set in the very near future though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived this atypical giant robot anime features the characters rather than the machinery as the primary focus as a whole patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains giant industrial robots known as labors an interesting play on words considering that robot is derived from the czech word for labor have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century with the rise of labors however has come a new menace labor crime this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions using patrol labors to fight labor crime the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division sv who through no fault of their own have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness sometimes utterly hilarious sometimes almost deadly serious the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers the story as has much of patlabor before centers around the controversial babylon project a gigantic seawall that will on its completion allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists most notably the house of sea organization however the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist but from someone who is already dead shinohara heavy industries the premier labor manufacturer in japan if not the whole world has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors movement speed and efficiency by this hyper operating system hos for short has very quickly been installed into well over of the nation s labors including the patrol labors of sv since that installation dozens of labors including a heavily armed military model have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos some wags have compared this to windows it s up to asuma shinohara labor command officer with sv and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries to find the source of these problems before more labors including sv s own fall victim to them and before hos drags his father s company down with it as was the case with ghost in the shell if you just want a no brainer actionfest this might not be the movie for you patlabor the movie is more of a psychological thriller a technological suspense drama it is closer perhaps to a chrichton novel than to an action movie crichton novels that have been made into action movies notwithstanding there are long thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo similar to sequences from ghost in the shell this movie is fraught with symbolism in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism patlabor s near future setting is aside from the giant robots tromping around very similar to our own present day the film uses this setting to make its central point is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor s alternate setting as far as the technical aspects of the film go referring to the subtitled version as that s the only one i ve seen the film transfer is clear almost phenomenally so the animation quality is incredible though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to the oavs and tv series were more cheerful better suited to humor the movie however makes everyone look a great deal less cute and emphasizes that this is going to be for the most part a deadly serious storyline as far as cinematography goes there are many interesting moments in patlabor the movie i don t think i can recall ever seeing a fish eye perspective used in any other animated film save for ghost in the shell another oshii film or indeed in many other movies at all the cinematography is well suited to the storyline emphasizing what it needs to though a couple of scenes where characters features are exaggerated in anger may seem slightly strange to western audiences the audio track of patlabor the movie is in glorious hi fi stereo and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems it is that good even without headphones sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to come from that side giant robot footsteps are deep and booming the sometimes understated sometimes blaring score is crisp and clear and always right on the mark enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery as far as the subtitles go i have to say that they re among the most easily readable subtitles i ve ever seen for anything large enough that they don t strain the eyes but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen although it does have several action sequences in it most notably the climactic conclusion patlabor is foremost not an action movie although it is a superbly realized film it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story and that could detract from some people s enjoyment my 
apparently director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film american history x i don t know the details of the fight but it seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether i ve heard about this kind of thing happening before and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce as it is i found american history x to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kaye s focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of a powerful charismatic performance from edward norton it s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton s fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself a star norton is one of those performers who becomes his character and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year he plays a young man named derek vinyard a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly d angelo and sister davin jennifer lien the film opens with a flashback in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car we find out that this lands him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny in the present time of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother much of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that leads to derek s adoption of white supremacy when derek is released having served three years in prison he finds that his brother is now a full blown skinhead derek however has given up the violence and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms it s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach but kaye has found the right note for his material because american history x is a mainstream film there has to be a redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic i partially disagree with this because although i do not advocate racism in any way it s interesting the way kaye presents derek he is a loud obnoxious man but he s also very smart the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men it s clear that he s passionate about his beliefs and that he s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up of course it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part it s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest in addition to getting the look just right he s perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and a whole lot of shouting and norton does it all with ease even when he s at his meanest derek has a likable quality to him and that s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny s school avery brooks becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny the other performances are all terrific with standouts from furlong d angelo and lien visually the film is very powerful kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices and most of them work nicely lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere but like a lot of movies lately american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes although the climactic scene is very moving the picture ends with a pretentious preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point it felt like a slap in the face to be hand fed a theme in such a simplistic way it makes me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film perhaps this last scene was the problem it s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good in a time when so many movies are timid and weak american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way 
i rented brokedown palace last night blind having heard nothing about it beforehand and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety that is no easy task superficially it bears an unfortunate and not necessarily unintended resemblance to several other movies notably return to paradise and midnight express as a result nearly every review of brokedown palace i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons the consequence was nearly universal condemnation which is a shame as this is a fine film for those who have yet to view the movie let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system as was midnight express nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of return to paradise in my view if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad s acclaimed novel lord jim problematically the basic storyline seems more than familiar two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set up involving a suave con man a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world justice system the girls are alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale they re life long buddies who planned a high school graduation trip to hawaii and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents once there they find a hotel and go sight seeing which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them but they are saved from hotel security by a charming friendly australian nick daniel lapaine who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl s scam he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves first toward alice then toward darlene by now alarm bells are going off among viewers the ever present nick is too slick and his stories don t add up to us the girls of course are too naive to notice long before it happens we re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag literally containing heroin just as predictably the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison bound for a long stretch left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice for those in need of a ready answer might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl s fleabag hotel as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer fixer yankee hank bill pullam and his thai born partner wife a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film s tag lines who do you trust and hank is no exception although seasoned movie goers and those familiar with pullman s oeuvre will find few surprises much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short hand fashion lou diamond phillips for instance plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank withholds vital information at crucial moments is he part of a wider conspiracy with an inherently powerful if somewhat tired premise the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama a prison story and a potential character study of american teens their relationship and what constitutes friendship between them the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful with the girls interaction hank s investigation and the various trials and hearings offering hope for their release delivering tension as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape if brokedown palace has a major flaw it is its creators tendency like time constrained tourists to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half way down and return to the story s main avenue and if that were all there was to brokedown palace it wouldn t be a very good movie but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and in this they succeeded for the main theme of the movie like the proffered name of its location is freedom in all its permutations ultimately the other sub themes may be considered window dressing young and pretty alice danes is an old soul a wild streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang dark and light is her cautious best friend darlene beckinsale clear eyed and straightforward alice is more complex than her friend she comes from a poorer background has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone including her own father whereas darlene s life is on track aimed at college marriage kids a career a suburban home middle age and fulfillment alice s is uncertain unfocused and yearning one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors friends and relatives from home whose lives continue while hers is in limbo tellingly alice is present but not included just as revealing of their different personalities when alice and dar first come to thailand the openness and delight on alice s face doesn t read as simple naivet the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat reaching toward the sun she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom while dar remains seated in the shade brokedown palace begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank however unintentional it s all alice s fault she s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film s beginning darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison dar of course is the willing dupe which in her view confers innocence never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate dar is innocent it doesn t matter alice is the subject of this movie she and her journey toward personal freedom along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half baked sensibilities and materialistic goals in the end that culture like its representatives yankee hank and dar s father a man who knows how to grease the wheels proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl s tragedy thailand s culture contrary to most opinion comes off much better by comparison it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes i believe the filmmaker s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior the thai with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native born their prison in stark contrast to the probable reality was no hellhole being relatively clean and sunlit the prison authorities demanded good hygiene provided medical care when needed and hard manual labor consisted of picking grass the thai guards were authoritarian what else but certainly not routinely sadistic as for the thai justice system the reasoning of the thai judges during both an appeal hearing and in the film s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality freedom has many faces and brokedown palace explores many of them in the extreme we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter but freedom seldom comes without a price which is why the movie s other tag lines are what is your dream and how far would you go i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom incarcerated or not by film s end is alice she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact kate beckinsale s character might more properly be likened to the released temple bird referred to twice during the film trained to fly back to its cage as the thai magistrate observed in the film s climactic scene the issue was always one of character and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that freedom is achieved within oneself if one thinks back over the movie which character was transformed by their experiences increasingly the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of kung fu woman female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures here at last is the story of a modern heroine in reading the many user s comments i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon whether or not a person liked the movie almost everyone praised the actors think about that when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it but raving about all the performances in it do yourself a favor rent brokedown palace and watch it with a open mind there s more there than meets the eye 
quiz show an almost perfectly accurate true story is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid s twenty one on this trivial game show contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice on which they wagered an amount of points on the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win but after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants herbie stempel and charles van doren stempel john turturro a former g i and your jewish man raising a family stempel has been the reigning champion on twenty one for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars in his mind he is the best thing on television and the people love him although in the mind of the show s producers herbie stempel is getting old dan enright david paymer in particular feels that the people are tired of seeing a jewish guy from queens with bad teeth and that the kids need someone better to look up to therefore they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win someone who can defeat stempel even if they have to resort to cheating enter charles van doren ralph fiennes a well educated professor from a widely recognized family van doren had decided to try out for the game show tic tac dough because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing but when albert freedman hank azaria enright s assistant spots van doren the two decide that they have found their soon to be ruler of the twenty one kingdom van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer on purpose in order to lose the game after stempel loses the throne to van doren he starts to feel cheated which he should meanwhile on his own dick goodwin rob morrow a harvard law graduate has decided to start an investigation on twenty one to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved quiz show is an extremely well done movie and robert redford s direction is especially superb the performances turned in by john turturro ralph fiennes and rob morrow are very good although it seems that turturro stands out more than any quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film definitely a film you should not miss 
a lot of times a three star film will be my favorite they re usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too they re usually not too deep allowing for semi brainless relaxation and at the same time not too dumb men in black is a four star three star film hope you could follow that one men in black doesn t wait to get to the fun just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay tommy lee jones introduced to an alien and introduced to the the awesome memory diminishing tool that all mib agents use after all you can t have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you men in black is of course the organization which moniters all extra terrestrial activity on earth nypd officer james edwards will smith is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no good punk he s chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end and with that dives off of a roof naturally nobody believes his story nobody that is except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of edwards then meets agent kay the man who never seems to crack a smile and is introduced to the mib edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him birth certificate drivers license and even the literal removal of his fingerprints james edwards no longer exists meet agent jay agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about regular duties eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play a bug has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don t or can t stop it the plot isn t exactly clear but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth and that is crucial that the mib find it before the bug does barry sonnenfeld who also did the addams family films directs this nicely it s fun it s funny it s action packed a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be this is one of those movies that is just fun and can t really be summed up any nicer or clearer will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch definitely one of the best films of the the summer of men in black comes highly recommeded from me 
steve soderbergh s sex lies and videotape which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in arguably began the resurgence of independent films made on a shoestring budget of million with then relatively unknown actors it is a provocative thoroughly original drama the film mostly focuses on the four central characters all in their late s early s ann andie macdowell an unfulfilled housewife is married to john peter gallagher an insensitive lawyer who unbeknownst to her is having an affair with her younger sister cynthia laura san giacomo complicating matters even worse is graham james spader who won best actor at cannes john s old college buddy who comes to stay at their house ann is absolutely won over by him even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex that is the set up for the last hour of the picture and since the film is entitled sex lies and videotape it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker ranging from the independent to the mainstream s out of sight to the downright kafkaesque s schizopolis he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances and believes in the work that he does and sex lies and videotape is probably his most confident and maybe even best to date the performances are superb from all four leads but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character she is always a very winning actress but this is probably her most three dimensional role that she has had with a close second being altman s mosaic short cuts the other parts are perfectly cast as well from spader s ominous graham to gallagher s self involved john to giacomo s outspoken cynthia the final act of the film especially comes right out of left field and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching and it would be criminal to give away the film s secrets suffice to say that through one powerful sequence ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty as well as deception the film has one fault however the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another and often unlikable if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher it probably would have helped since his relationship with macdowell isn t quite as explored as i would have liked sex lies and videotape although minorly flawed is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it and the final product certainly proves this 
deep rising is one of those movies the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god screw that it says boldly let s see some computer generated monsters rip into decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors heh them wacky monsters gotta love em of course since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story hollywood must give that little extra oumph to get people in theaters that is where deep rising fails which is a good thing confused let me explain despite all them flashy effects and big explosions deep rising is still at heart a good ol b movie luckily it s a very good b movie the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie s bread and butter therefore things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre of course we know there s a big slimy creature behind that door that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive we just don t know when or how horrible it will be i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually well pretty darn funny at times a funny b movie well that s new these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh except for a few unintended laughs once a while and before you know it treat williams wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen hey i know them guys and gal from a couple of other movies cool familiar faces so far so good our man treat is the hero he ll live wes is a staple of b movies he is the token victim we know he ll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out famke is the babe nuff said there is also a guy with glasses the guy with glasses always dies a black person b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies never fails and a very funny nerdy guy ah comic relief how can we possibly explain having to kill him let him live after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew please kill me suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times went ewwww about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing i m a man we nottice these things all in all i d recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you the acting is decent the effects top rate how to best describe it put together the jet ski scene from hard rain the bug attacks from starship troopers a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming don t go there he s behind you and you end up with deep rising for creepy crawly goodness tight t shirts major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water 
anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases especially hercules emotion all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren t going to hold anyone s interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together not since disney s beauty the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works the story of the romanov family the rulers of russia and their downfall begins the film anastasia one of the daughters narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin voiced by christopher lloyd with her grandmother voiced by angela landsbury but anastasia gets lost and grows up with no memory of her royal origins the grandmother lives in paris hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution a young woman named anya voiced by meg ryan runs across dimitri john cusack and vlad kelsey grammar who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money they pick anya to pose as their princes and of course it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner and meanwhile rasputin is not dead and plots his revenge against the last romanov the plot is actually quite well structured there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later but it moves along fast enough that they ll never have time to be bored what this really means is that the adults won t be bored by it either there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses there is of course lots of comedy for the kids including rasputin s pet bat bartok hank azaria who is easily the funniest thing in the film however the comical scenes never distract from the drama but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly the animation is gorgeous the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators not since beauty the beast have animated characters had so much life to them even without the voices they act the musical number in paris is a show stopper with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style as with all recent animated features there are songs however these songs do more than just provide fodder for top singers to get on the radio although there are three of them during the end credits the songs are all very catchy and advance the plot instead of just being showpieces except for the paris number but that s so much fun it s okay i can t reccomend anastasia highly enough it s a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics kids and adults alike will enjoy it and it s also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney 
one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy s wedding and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald who hasn t made a worthwhile film since but the fact is betsy s wedding is also an alan alda film and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life written and directed by alda betsy s wedding is a vibrant slice of life mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor alda s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare as bride and groom molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film but they are by far the least interesting walsh is a nonentity with all the screen presence of a door knob ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain she looks hideous with her short cropped orange hair red lip stick and grotesque outfits she s supposed to be a dress designer but she looks more like a clown and to make matters worse ringwald s performance matches her appearance thankfully alda keeps ringwald s screen time to a minimum he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride s working class italian family and the groom s rich gentile family ringwald s folks are homey and down to earth with alda as her free spirited father madeline kahn as her practical mother and ally sheedy as her lonely sister walsh s clan on the other hand is prim proper and ostentatious when the two families meet and mingle the movie becomes a story of culture clash or as one character puts it money versus values ally sheedy in a wonderfully understated performance is one of the film s most pleasant surprises sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body it s anthony lapaglia however who seizes the spotlight lapaglia plays stevie dee a suave overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry lapaglia s sincere but dim witted character is a riot and what s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role model and partly a rip off i don t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re born but i do know that lapaglia s over the top performance should not be missed the scrumptious comic acting however extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia joe pesci in particular sinks his teeth into his role as alda s unscrupulous brother in law a slum lord with mob ties who is cheating on his wife catherine o hara alda faced with challenge of both directing and acting somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride s financially strapped father a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet the film adopts alda s psychological point of view as he tries to one plan the wedding and two pay for it as a filmmaker alda s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful and while he doesn t have the comic genius of a woody allen alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy 
capsule trippy hyperspeed action machine from hong kong s accomplished tsui hark van damme and rodman have nice chemistry the stunts are eyepopping and stuff gets blowed up real good what more do you want i admit i was all set to loathe double team it reeked of cheapjack timing oriented marketing stick dennis rodman in a movie quick while he s hot and do something about jean claude van damme s flagging career while we re at it surprise double team transcends its dumb roots and turns out to be a mess of fun bring some friends get some pretzels and have a blast van damme is jack quinn an ex agent who is brought back in for one last mission you d think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words but van damme s character has a pregnant wife who s also a sculptor and some unpleasant pressure gets used to get him to come through on this mission he s been assigned to take down an old enemy a terrorist named stavros mickey rourke looking oddly subdued who may be back up to his old tricks in the first showdown between quinn and stavros the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve nonstop action an amusement park a hospital a private retired spy s retreat most of rome various houses planes cars and other modes of transport and the coliseum all become arenas for some of the most bone rattling shoot outs and punch outs filmed they are better seen than described and are reason enough to see the film one jaw dropping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his feet van damme is a good dextrous athlete and fighter but he is often upstaged there are other nice touches stavros and quinn both want the same thing to retire in peace with their families that ambition ties them together in various ways and also humanizes them a bit one of the things about hk action movies is that there s always some form of human element and that s carried over into this movie as well it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable also good is dennis rodman playing a weapons dealer named yaz a character who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers and who is funny just standing there rodman is natural on screen he s fun to watch especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs and deserves to get a movie of his own based on what s seen here a lightweight fast moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently 
are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store wafflemovies com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves everyweek wafflemovies com reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video here is a sample review welcome to sarajevo in light of america s recent intervention in kosovo welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years set in sarajevo and based on actual events this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding as they make their way down the street a sniper shoots the mother of the bride yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war in this scene we meet joe flynn woody harrelson an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church joe is cocky but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn t even know his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson stephen dillane michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world s lack of interest henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother s death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread he decides to take action when a united nations delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult during his visits he befriends a pre teen girl emira emira nuseric who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner he promises to get emira out of harm s way if he gets the chance after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children henderson loses hope however his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina marisa tomei and her children s aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans unfortunately only babies are wanted for adoption so henderson pledges to take emira to england the group of children nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps the movie was beautifully and sensitively made director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred they show the destroyed lives families that have been split up and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson his producer and flynn have befriended the group of twenty somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life s simplest pleasures and amenities one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth like the rest of those deeply effected by the war this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the olympics winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies com selection mad city we watch them struggle to cover the horror while trying to remain professionally detached however they are human and question the reason behind it all why no one cares and how they can get out stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy henderson realizes that he cannot save the world but he can help a few it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary sandra bullock disaster two if by sea woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest most versatile actors of his generation harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character s caring nature and vulnerability shine through harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men cheers white men can t jump as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one this ability will serve him well and give him a long successful career america s involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict the entire movie most importantly the opening scenes provide a history lesson war is a foreign concept to most of us in america battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world something we don t do enough of in s america 
the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire fu copycats it s not a pretty death and it s leaving the likes of schwartznager stallone and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea sometimes the mix results in a mind blowing spectacle unlike any other quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work as in s the matrix can be a real gem but too often hollywood gets it wrong even when they pay off chinese directors flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists mostly it s laughable in hollywood s rush to emulate the success of the matrix trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form but iron monkey the latest asian import shows us how to get it right iron monkey actually a reissue of a film is the story of a th chinese vigilante rongguang yu fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei hong most recently seen in one of the most overlooked and possibly best films of drunken master released in the u s as the legend of drunken master unlike drunken master which stars jackie chan as an adult fei hong iron monkey finds a much younger fei hong sze man tsang and his father wong kei ying yen chi dan thrust into the middle of iron monkey s fight against oppression iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master at times fighting styles especially that of monkey himself do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle toed floating of films like crouching tiger hidden dragon director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger however there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good hearted but misguided enemy chief fox in those moments and in others iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune aka siunin wong fei hung tsi titmalau 
this is the movie not the perfume a slow moving stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock s vertigo it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader set in new orleans it shows the wealthy michael courtland cliff robertson sitting on top of the world celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion as his lovely wife elizabeth genevi ve bujold and young daughter amy blackman both look up to him beaming with joy his real estate development partner bob la salle john lithgow proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business while his high society friends give him their best wishes upon retiring for the night his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver tomorrow or they will be killed inspector brie stanley reyes comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange as that will lead them to the kidnappers but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase the kidnapper s car explodes and goes over the bridge where none of the bodies were found grieving the loss of his wife and child the guilt ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence italy where he met his wife when he goes to the church where they met he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife her name is sandra portinari genevi ve bujold and she s working there restoring art that is decaying he falls instantly in love with her and doesn t heed bob s warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him the surprises to come weren t really all that surprising as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ve bujold and the competent acting of john lithgow it plays too much like a rehash of the master s work to break any new ground yet it is still thrilling in its own way 
the bond series is an island in the film world where else would we look forward to cliches and all of the other things that occur in most of these films where else would pure escapism a vulnerable hero the talking villains blatant product placement predictable action sequences and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change i don t understand it myself but that s what the bond series is based on for i think films we ve mostly got the same thing over and over again with some variation and a bit of change most notably in the two dalton films but even i a king of cynicism can t bitch about it and tomorrow never dies the again i think eighteenth bond film and second brosnan bond film is no exception thank god the plot as in most of them is pure balderdash but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it instead of just plain billionaire psychotics we get a rupert murdoch esque media mogul psychotic elliot carver jonathan pryce looking bitching with a white haired cru cut and always talking like he s out of breath who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war no this is not wag the dog he wants a real war between china and england and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it in comes bond james is sent all around the world trying to do research on carver fighting with his men and running into on more than one occasion a chinese secret agent like him wai lin michelle yeoh asian action star extraordinaire and co star of supercop nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one the two eventually and predictably of course begin working together and yes there is some sexual tension between the two luckily their relationship is never strained and she never gives into his cassanova ness until the finale thank god again in every bond film james bags on average three women sometimes more sometimes less the latter being more potent towards the aids cautionary dalton and he doesn t spoil this one though we never see them of course i mean they need to stay around a pg rating there s always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again the big bond girl yeoh and this time we have an almost cameo by teri hatcher as carver s wife paris who it seems was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning yes teri s very attractive but she seems kind of dull of course it s not really her fault her part is under written and she s only in a small part of it oh well and there are always the big henchmen the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains this time we get a tall arian looking not to mention robert shaw in from russia with love looking guy named stamper goetz otto who is pretty awesome although a bit stiff well mostly his posture really and for a bit of comedy we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point the government people have small parts as usual with q desmond llewelyn looking near death sadly getting only one scene in a more grouchy mood than usual and m judi dench getting more than m usually gets i mean it is judi dench and for no reason whatsoever except cause he was so good in goldeneye joe don baker shows up again as wade admitting he has no reason for being there and is this time more annoying again oh well the action sequences are not a let down although sometimes go on too long they pop up every now and then mainly because they have to for the sake of the series and some significant ones are the opening one one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control and a motorcylce chase on a bmw cycle nonetheless through china streets or was it vietnam the plot s not really essential they re more high tech and feature much more laughs which yeah i dig so what if they re distracting they re supposed to be the acting from most around is great yeoh is actually one of the better bond girls mainly because she s so unique the better bond girls are more independent and have a certain wily ness to them pussy galore with her homoerotic undertones and all is one of the best and diana rigg who married bond at the end of on her majesty s secret service only to be killed added some emotional depth yeoh is notable since she s so active and has great chemistry with brosnan pryce is an awesome villain being slimy and lovable at the same time and brosnan is once again the mack daddy the bond series is built on cliches mainly because they re so fun and add to the escapism if you can remember the dalton years and they re serious direction you remember how unsuccessful they were both financially and aesthetically the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot too many themes and too much characterization i don t really understand it myself yet i m one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states having seen all of them more than once yes i ve seen this twice already you can tell i adore them while it s not one of the best like goldfinger or from russia with love tomorrow never dies is nonetheless a truly awesome installment even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones 
 contact shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses see contact with your family it is a movie for all ages a review by stuart cracraft contact starring jodie foster matthew mcconaughey john hurt director robert zemeckis star after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers of zoom out start which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof morrison s work contact picks up steam gradually building by the end an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out of balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological geek side by the end the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what s out there this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high tech movies however except for jodie foster elie arroway and john hurt s r hadden who are both actors of exceptional caliber the supporting cast are not especially impressive hurt certainly has had better roles stephen ward in scandal this one as the multi billionare hadden does not do his acting skills justice this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation foster s radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms early scenes take a long long time to build up to this the movie s pacing is very good and subtle the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful the politics of foster s character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however one of the most entertaining but very short scenes is when foster is confronted by rob lowe during a cabinet level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters everything else was very one sided e g foster lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far away world in the starsystem of vega it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley s scenes in his book steel beach where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself and in foster s case an illusion drawn from her memory in another sense this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry s star trek pilot the cage later the menagerie when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens the concept is not new by any sense in the world of science fiction but the beach scene which is the centerpiece of the film as is the whole film is driven by foster freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast as the movie gains speed foster s acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her it is certainly oscar caliber acting unquestionably the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos cleverly manipulated george stephanopolus style to seem very forrest gump in fact zemeckis et al got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie vis a vis clinton but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton s walk ons the much discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not also the near final scene in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan science popularizer and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe perhaps now sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden 
set in the wild west this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid sidney james and his cronies in stodge city his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke kenneth williams so much that he asks sheriff albert earp jon pertwee to drive rumpo out of town instead the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead therefore judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city due to a misunderstanding an english sanitary engineer called marshall p knutt jim dale is assigned without knowing it as the law marshall for stodge city he arrives at the same time as annie oakley angela douglas who is seeking revenge for her father the sheriff s murder when marshall arrives at stodge city he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong in the end there is a head to head between rumpo and marshall with the rumpo s past experience it would seem that marshall is out of his depth but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley he at least stands some chance sid james with an american accent is perfect as the rumpo kid a part which suits him down to the ground jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw in his debut as big heap and little heap respectively big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing as is his performance he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid however the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary and pertwee s performance is rather poor kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the judge even so this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams favourite a very different carry on film in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on the death count is the highest of any carry on film sets costumes and action sequences are all very commendable the songs that are included in the movie the title song and annie s song are very impressive a strange but therefore very interesting carry on film not the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series

as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d day the weary seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck as the flap falls the battle begins they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire amid the chaos of this massacre stands a shot that at least for me hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler s list a soldier clearly missing an arm wanders around the body strewn beach like a lost puppy we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself he bends over picks up his arm and starts to carry it probably not bothering to ask himself what now saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film the direction is out of this world surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar the cinematography by janusz kaminsky is also astounding but be forewarned this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get the question is does the story and its realism justify the excessive use the answer from my point of view is no braveheart was a truly gritty and one would imagine realistic battle film ryan is ten times worse expect disembowelments sucked in skulls heads blown to bits arms and legs flying across the battlefield many in the theater could not bear to watch and it is a shame too because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters and academy members saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d day through into the film s primary mission captain miller hanks assembles an man crew and sets off to find a missing solider private ryan whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs ryan doesn t recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons that no person should suffer such injustice miller s crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan though they don t yet know him they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn t have any more or less right to live than any of them this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and though there is a lot of set up between battles the story continues full speed to the end the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it s own spielberg though not a student of the quick cut school of filmmaking takes a stab at it here and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it bay should pay close attention take copious notes if you want to jump cut every two seconds do it the way spielberg does it in ryan in the end the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the importance of the film schindler s list taught many people the truth about the holocaust it opened eyes sparked debate and study though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before they don t amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler s list overall this is just the truest depiction of the old adage war is hell but braveheart dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again masterful work marred only by excessive gore 
capsule suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick which isn t necessarily a bad thing not exactly oscar caliber but one helluva bullet riddled good time extended review you know i remember when hitmen were evil murderous scum alas the times are a changin in a recent string of movies hitmen are suddenly wise cracking fun loving killers with hearts this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong s first american feature the big hit oddly enough about the same time last year a similar film grosse point blank was released advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it the big hit is quite the opposite it was hyped as the new film from producer john woo so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action however there s a sore lack of it which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver mel played by mark wahlberg in a dopey milquetoast role is a killing machine he flips spins even breakdances whilst popping caps sadly he doesn t get a chance to do much of it except for the beginning set piece and the last twenty minutes or so the film is in comedy mode the action at least what there is of it is prime cut stuff wong after numerous hong kong features makes quite a nice u s debut however his pacing is a bit off with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough they start off electrifying and fresh but just kinda stop normally this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable luckily we have ben ramsey s screenplay a bitingly funny piece of work the only problem is there might be too much humor one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel s hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled some being there only for a laugh which sometimes works sometimes doesn t overall the big hit may have it s flaws but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed gut wrenchingly funny joyride definately one of the better ways to spend two hours 
a cinematic version of one of john irving s novels is always cause for celebration even if as in the case of simon birch the treatment is merely suggested by rather than strictly based on the book suggested means that irving author of the acclaimed the world according to garp sold the rights to his novel a prayer for owen meany to the disney machine for million but wouldn t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names that s an odd decision irving claims it s to protect both himself and the novel but it s one that doesn t unduly harm the finished product irving s books are rich and complex works full of intriguing colorful characters a prayer for owen meany is no exception it tells the story of an unusual boy called simon birch in the film version who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high pitched falsetto voice like strangled mice simon believes himself to be god s instrument placed on this earth to somehow effect god s plan simon is played by ian michael smith who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which among other things prevents bones ligaments and joints from developing normally smith s debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for simon birch however the producers unwisely favored form over function smith s acting abilities are limited at best another drawback is that in the book simon s condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters in careful loving detail watching simon birch however creates a different feeling altogether the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character surely something irving would not have intended simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating a combination of smith s rookie status as an actor and the precocious one liners he s forced to deliver courtesy mark steven johnson the film s director and screenwriter fortunately simon birch isn t the real star of the film that bears his name simon is more of a catalyst allowing his co stars to shape the story and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances saving the film from an obsequious manipulative destiny first and foremost is joseph mazzello jurassic park who is nothing less than remarkable as simon s best friend joe mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a year old ripe with laughter pain and tears he is certainly an emerging talent ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca joe s single mother and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend ben david strathairn and jan hooks play the town s reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others there s even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from well that would be telling perhaps suggested by the novel is the appropriate way to go after all since simon birch only focuses on one chapter one year of simon s extraordinary life the film also changes the book s ending to one that is more melodramatic yet necessary given simon s lot the flavor of irving s original novel remains however the passions friendships and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown maine and the engaging oddballs both big and small who reside there 
ladies and gentlemen s independence day is here it s title starship troopers and surprisingly it is more entertaining than id i realize that i gave last year s sci fi hit a star rating but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour after subsequent viewings i feel that independence day really wasn t as great as it seemed though i still give it a positive review starship troopers on the other hand has a mocking sense of humor knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem as a result starship troopers is a more exciting energetic and lively science fiction film in fact i probably could never get tired of watching this film starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars another kick ass space opera which reinvented the sci fi drama altogether while starship troopers is no star wars it comes quite close and the easiest assessment would be to call this film the star wars of the s am i being to generous to this film perhaps but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance effectively into the warring races in essence this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films and i may have to starship troopers is not quite an original film persay but director paul verhoeven gives the film a kick the aliens asses style id had this same style except it was forced most likely the cause of will smith having a major role this new star wars has a very simple basic plot mankind vs an alien species the alien species in question here is the bugs a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid type insects however the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes but during quiet moments we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization more than likely these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends and they should be i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought provoking film this is an event film but surprisingly above average it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci fi war film and actually root for the human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange join the army ads mixing a web based interface these summations of events are refreshingly original stating would you like to know more these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor and we know we should not take it seriously however we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle in a gory yet funny way after witnessing the slaughter the film jumps back one year to setup what we just saw we are introduced to johnny rico casper van dien and carmen ibanez denise richards rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms however carmen isn t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer has her eye on rico unfortunately rico isn t interested in dizzy this setup is rather cliched as is the result of the setup but it still is fun to watch carmen signs up to become a starship trooper and as a result rico signs up and as a result dizzy signs up everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy carmen gets the pilot position she wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris a psychic gets a position in the training program and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers the mobile infantry the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships in reality i found myself watching a space version of melrose place but with better special effects an hour into the film the war begins a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with the first hour may have been a funny sometimes unintentionally setup but we grew to care for the flat characters because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters their gorgeous looks won me over call me superficial if you must following the training sessions which had many dramas in themselves too many to mention here the troopers are sent to war the bugs live on the planet klendathu a planet which consists of dirt and rock and pretty much nothing else many dramas occur during the war until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense the troopers are ordered to locate the brain and capture it i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible because starship troopers is not about plot it s about special effects and gory violence director verhoeven most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct returns to his sci fi days which gave us good films like total recall verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa but despite all the violence the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood starship troopers is extremely violent with more gore than this year s event horizon the r rating is well deserved and hopefully parents will not allow their year old children to see it my guess is that verhoeven s target audience is the to male group the film has a testosterone level off the charts with chiseled men and beautiful women despite these superficial elements starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful while watching the film we never second guess the character s decisions because they seem perfectly clear thankfully no hero is punching aliens in the face which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with but they soon grow on you casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon to most guys he will come across as artificial fortunately van dien is the worst of the cast despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character her dizzy is extremely likeable denise richards also does a good job and her scenes are very well done jake busey gary busey s son gives a wonderfully funny performance and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film neil patrick harris remember he was doogie howser is a little wooden and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast however he does give a good performance michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm his performance rises above the rest perhaps it is because his character is the most developed but i think it is just ironside s presence on screen unfortunately no particular cast member gives a star making performance which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars director verhoeven is the main star of the film his direction is fast and unrelentless he never slows down his pace which makes for a wild ride writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein the writing is usually very funny and sometimes very corny the dialogue is smart but not too smart we aren t required to know everything but some plot holes are left unanswered thankfully we are not intended to notice and we really don t except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while amazingly with all the wars and romance going on the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues in fact these governmental changes seem fairly plausible and this adds another layer to the story the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage i haven t laughed this loud even in some comedies oh and the special effects are first rate starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci fi violence and gore and for some language and nudity believe me when i say this don t take young kids to see this film it is extremely violent in fact it is probably the most violent film out this year however if you are old enough over to see it starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain it s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros while also cheering for the bad guys and still it is my dream to see a sci fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind and take over the world now that would be entertaining 
it s a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn t need violence to be good or worth watching all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo nuclear war and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon a computer whiz kid david is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game he wants to be the first to play it instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad with the help of jennifer a girl in his biology class he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr war operation plan response a top notch computer at the time but now hardly faster than my own computer i remember being and watching this at the cinema it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn t changed of course a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in i wouldn t be surprised if this gave people nightmares i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers although her interest in david remains a mystery but the rest of the actors are by no fault of their own restricted by the script to play one dimensional grownups david s parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the s movies like secret admirer porky s or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr strangelove if for no other reason you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on far from any k modem my guess is that it s some kind of bps modem the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights just like those you see on star trek or any old sf movie but it s hardly impressing compared with what you can get today what are the lessons we can learn from wargames make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers thank you whoever it was for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers 
since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they re portraying it s fitting to say that beloved come as a real shock as a film it s confusing bizarre and as tough a film to watch as any film i ve seen all year and that s not necessarily because of the three hour running time beloved is challenging to watch filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard and instead of a straight forward hollywood ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed beloved comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened or rather toni morrison who wrote the novel upon which this is based beloved tells the story of an ex slave named sethe played by oprah winfrey who lives on a large farm in the north with her children when the film opens her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist which shakes things up wounds the dog and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family sethe is proud though and will not move her sons run away leaving only her and her daughter denver kimberly elise alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation a couple years pass and the ghost remains and one day a man named paul d danny glover another ex slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together arrives asking for lodging he has been wandering around since he left the plantation and when he enters the house it turns red and becomes incredibly hot when he remarks about what he thinks is evil sethe replies it ain t evil it s just sad some more time passes and paul d has become a fervent member of the household and the ghost disappears but when they return one day from going out they discover a young woman sitting in the house her name is beloved and as played by thandie newton she has almost zero motor skills she stumbles around half grabbing onto things and knocking them over and when she speaks she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk they let her into her house and she begins to turn things upside down beloved acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic low lit room with the occasional flash to the past where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern day psychoanalysts sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands with her nipples being licked prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it they took my milk worst of all was the month after her freedom when she was allowed to live like a free person working with other blacks on a farm and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back she runs to the barn near by carrying her four children and when her old owners burst in they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don t leave them alone when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film she says she doesn t regret it she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did and she has convinced herself she did the right thing of course beloved is really her daugher materialized though we aren t flat out told that until later on in the film beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long thus beloved becomes a sorta redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci fi classic solaris where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife who commited suicide years before has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us it would control us completely beloved moves along freely without a lot of explanation and for the most part this is extremely respectable the most interesting films are the ones that don t explain everything for us leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense sethe is never fully explained as a character but we understand all her actions since she s being played by oprah winfrey it s been well over a decade since her last major performance in the color purple but judging from these two films i ll bet she s one of the best actresses working today if she was strictly an actress her talk show which i suppose is a great entity has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress and that s a shame because she brings so much to this movie emotion sadness strength watching the strong sethe who s so afraid of the past that she s built a rather strong protective coating around herself break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great she makes it real that s not to say this is a perfect film in fact i d wager to say that the fact that it s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is while oprah s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic and i m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february the structure of the film which doesn t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film it doesn t necessarily move as though they re memories of one particular character and by the end it has lost control over sethe and as she takes to bed we are unable to truly identify with her anymore but despite its tediousness perhaps that s the point the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable and it needs to get back with reality and for the most part this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be jonathan demme s direction is bizarre in nature with the story and he creates the right mood making it a tough film to sit through making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters there s more to admire here like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization just like they would be in real life and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering but laced with a touch of optimism the acting not only from winfrey is amazing and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination everyone has been raving about thandie newton s performance and how it should be rewarded however it must be noted that out of everyone she had the easiest part act like a baby throw things stumble around chew food with your mouth open i do think there s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation but it s kimberly elise as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane and has to carry the burden of her mother s loss of reality towards the end it s not that newton isn t great she s as annoying and wacky as the role demands it s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it and not that of writer morrison or director demme beloved has still not done well costing i think around ninety million dollars it has since grossed about twenty two unfortunately this film is a little too intense for viewers even for me and i can stand almost anything i recently viewed the hour long epic caligula the worst film i have ever seen in my life and did it in a mere sittings although i respect beloved i can t say that i really enjoyed it 
jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities but whom you end up liking anyway in as good as it gets the character in question is melvin udall a successful novelist with obsessive compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you know where he s mean i mean really mean the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium every day melvin eats at the same cafe sits at the same table and gets served by the same waitress you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance when his waitress carol helen hunt tells him he can just go sit in another section and all the other waitresses just cringe one day melvin makes a comment that goes to far and carol genuinely hurt comes down on him like a ton of bricks at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course but is also the only person who can get to him too another person who often crosses melvin s sights is simon greg kinnear an artist who lives on melvin s floor aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city simon has the added benefit of being gay making him a prime target simon s friend frank cuba gooding jr also gay does not fare much better when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital and frank who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor intimidates melvin into watching after simon s dog while he convalesces this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in melvin gets to like the dog and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin s softening up to the world around him it doesn t happen overnight but throughout the film he bites his tongue here cares a little there and most miraculously falls in love one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others he s traveling terra incognita here and it shows good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film especially by nicholson and hunt they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen greg kinnear who is becoming known for his supporting film roles is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels cuba gooding jr performs with a hyped up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear and comes through with a near constant comic performance the screenplay by mark andrus and james l brooks is clever touching and funny the best part about it however is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting melvin is a man we can t quite figure out but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention carol is a working woman living with her mother trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers but who is still not accepted by much of society combined with the talent of the actors these characters make the film the one noticeable area where the film is lacking however is the absence of cuba gooding jr through the second half his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary but the film ends before his return leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general in addition to a part in the film s conclusion there s one actor who will probably not be recognized by any awards but who contributes greatly to many of the movie s best scenes and who deserves mention this is that little dog he plays such a pivotal role to melvin s character development actually serves to forward the plot and has some absolutely scene stealing moments that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal award or no however when even the dog puts in a good performance you know you ve got an outstanding movie 
it s been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast sure there have been delightful outings like last years hercules but nothing entirely groundbreaking with the release of the studio s newest feature length film a remake of edgar rice burrough s creation tarzan disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques it s no classic but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be the plot is loyal to the original storyline as tarzan s parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire and find shelter in the jungles of africa but they are killed offscreen by the snarling cheetah sabor leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib found by kala voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own we follow the young boy through the years as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk a very brash but funny rosie o donnell and clumsy elephant tantor wayne knight of course in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero in tarzan these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here most of the characters are amusing without being forced as tarzan grows to manhood the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture here the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton brian blessed who s accompanying a hapless professor nigel hawthorne on an expedition through the jungle of course there s the professor s daughter jane nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking d element to the movement of the athletic title character and the fast paced editing is absolutely a marvel as tarzan carries jane through the treetops narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave your eyes can barely keep up it s a fantastic accomplishment the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average there are important questions raised about tarzan s place in the world and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward which is a surprising plus that i wasn t expecting to find here suffice to say this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained the grown up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn who made a name for himself as the big mean jerk from ghost goldwyn is effective playing someone who s not aware of his world s dangers glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother and lance henriksen from tv s millennium is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child as the movie s villain there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm but he is nothing compared to james woods hilarious hades from hercules a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all together noticeable screen presence still this is one great thrill ride that disney has constructed i never expected rice burrough s work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation nor with so much emotional depth parents along with all the kiddies are going to find much to like in tarzan 
the calendar year has not even reached its midway point but that hasn t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar bait season bille august s high profile adaptation of victor hugo s classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic handsome production values strong performances by a top notch cast a literate screenplay with one critically missing element emotional sweep for those not familiar with hugo s original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a th century french set version of the fugitive after serving years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread the brutish jean valjean liam neeson is paroled immediately upon release he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night he is caught by authorities only to be forgiven by the bishop who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow that he does and in doing so breaks his parole which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert geoffrey rush who was one of the guards in valjean s prison camp on his trail thematically however les miserables is a story about redemption which valjean finds through his dealings with two women the hard luck factory worker turned prostitute fantine uma thurman and her illegitimate daughter cosette years after breaking parole valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette mimi newman from her cruel caretakers the thenardiers and raise the child as his own the father and daughter eventually land in paris where the teenage cosette claire danes falls for dashing student revolutionary marius hans matheson the decades spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english language work following the underrated superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year s stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla s sense of snow he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace production designer anna asp costume designer gabriella pescucci and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable rush s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated oscar winning theatrics in shine and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role the younger members of the cast fare less well danes is convincing as cosette but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction and matheson while competent is a less interesting robert sean leonard as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is by the time les miserables was over my emotions had only been superficially involved while i was touched by valjean s relationships with fantine and cosette i was not moved not even reaching the touching level is the cosette marius pairing my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical as i am sure many others is and i was dismayed to see eponine a friend of marius s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation the daughter of the thenardiers here she is only briefly seen as a child her presence would have added some much needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine fantine was enough even so as creeps into summer blockbuster season les miserables is a thoughtful well made entertaining film one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no brainers invade the multiplex 
in something never though possible happened the film star wars was released with extraordinary never seen before techniques of special effects the film set a new standard for special effects in film not only did it set a standard for the special effects it set a standard for film itself the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi the jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side darth vader is the leader of the dark side ben obi wan kenobi played by sir alec guinness was one of those jedi who is still alive today darth vader was once a jedi until he turned to the dark side years after the killing of the jedi darth vader is still around causing trouble r d and c p are both what we call driods or robots that are of assistance to humans while an attack on the ship that princess leia played by carrie fisher is aboard she inserts a message to r d who is also on the ship to obi wan kenobi pleading for help the princess is captured by vader but r d and c p get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine the jawas or small creatures who sell droids pick r d and c p up to sell they are bought by luke skywalker s mark hamill family while luke is cleaning the droids the message from princess leia is found luke finds this obi wan kenobi and learns that obi wan was a friend of luke s father who is now dead luke also learns his family was a jedi after luke s family is killed by tropps from the dark side ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all ben wants to create a new jedi first the two must find princess leia and serve her han solo played by harrison ford and his sidekick chewbacca played by peter mayhew are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary after meeting up with leia the film really picks up luke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi ben kenobi confronts darth vader and many other interesting events occur star wars is an amazing epic the plot is so original and amazing i cannot believe it the special effects especially for its time are wonderful and realistic the space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch the ships flown by all are very unique and creative the costumes are also out of this world the scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before there are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever the entire premise of star wars is amazing the creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind even the human characters are different every character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films the acting on everyone s part is great especially that of sir alec guinness s even though the concept is not realistic at all it is pulled off very nicely the acting setting effects costumes and sound make it work if any of these were messed up star wars would have come off as one huge joke the ending works very well and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward in early a special edition of star wars was released the film was re mastered so it looked better than it did in a few creatures were added here and there and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt seen in return of the jedi was added to the film think that s enough on may star wars episode i the phantom menace will be released followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope with this star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time 
as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it the more pleased i was when i left first getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz if you liked scream you ll love wild things campbell gives a stunning performance this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days oh yeah the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me now onto more serious stuff and with this film i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way wild things has single handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa i m not saying that in a bad way but when you see this film you may be shocked by what you see however perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film s charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with an r rating being mormon i m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film trouble is i have already seen it and i like it wild things is a film noir of the s filled with s sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modern day taboos of s culture the style in which it is filmed is rich in color the actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film sure it s all too good to be true but ain t it fun to watch when movies like this come along sort of a better version of basic instinct there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it there will be people who don t want to admit liking what they see but i tell you most anyone who sees this will like it wild things begins at blue bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into it s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based on looks alone of course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared to the average person they are gorgeous immediately the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time we can turn off our brains right wrong while you may be expecting one thing to happen it certainly doesn t turn out that way the film begins in a classroom with nearly all the main characters present there s sam lombardo matt dillon a counselor for the students he s heading the class discussion there s also kelly van ryan denise richards a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam teaching the class however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubin vega who want to talk about sex cheers crimes boos what is a sex crime ray asks not gettin any one student responds this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch however upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands up and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body and so wild things sets into motion quickly kelly begins hitting on sam but sam doesn t want anything to do with her advances kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep surprisingly that s really all i can tell you about the plot any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists and what s more these plot twists are actually unpredictable going along the way of scream wild things maintains that film s surprises and then adds even more to them there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen and even though you think you may get tired of them the surprises are so genuine that it s rather pleasing going back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundaries of belief thankfully the convoluted plot doesn t give us much time to think about each one pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy well it is this is pretty much just one trashy film however it is the kind of trashy that isn t hard to watch it s good trash in a sense one the screenplay knows that it s not to be taken seriously and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story this varies everywhere from kelly s mother theresa russell who is more of a caricature of rich people all the way to an ambulance chasing lawyer bill murray who wears a neck brace to cover an insurance scam he is running bill murray also provides the best character in the film and most of the genuine laughs and two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed wild things is supposed to have sex in it what film with that title wouldn t and this movie breaks the boundaries instead of having heterosexual sex scenes it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell don t worry it s not as graphic as you might think the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon s full frontal nude scene it s very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it and for as long as i can remember i don t think i have seen an r rated film show an erect one before it s not completely but judging from the audiences reaction it was more than they expected too also during one scene late in the film there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon s characters but nothing came of it makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating or if the actors refused to do it what first made me want to see wild things was its cast neve campbell of course has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released here however she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead the closest role to this was her performance in the craft though even in that she was a nice girl campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent you can tell she will be around for a long time denise richards will also be around for a long time although she may be limited to the roles without much range here she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship troopers hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability and then there is daphne rubin vega a newcomer to the movies she gives a very good performance although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half towards the end she does get a bigger part on the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character but he makes the most of it you must have admiration though for what he did on screen and judging from many of the women s reactions in the theater to that shot they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right and then there is bill murray his performance is the comic relief and he nearly steals the film as a whole the entire cast works wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage a troi director john mcnaughton who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of a serial killer has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works his direction is smooth and stylish the visuals are striking filled with rich colors and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air however he seems more at home when the actors aren t talking his fly by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is a highlight the cinematography is gorgeous in its details its not often that you see a film like this and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures then there is the music this was probably the most obvious thing to me as it set the perfect mood for the film it s hard to describe in words so just see the film and listen to it it s wonderfully composed and presented and be sure to stick around during the closing credits mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use while most comedies use it for outtakes he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot but it s an entertaining way to finish the film plus there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality nudity language and violence again the nudity is rather unnecessary but let s face it people want to see it so why not give it to them neve campbell admirably has a no nudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off way to go neve the sex scenes are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hands one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating the language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo to your average everyday profanity and i can t stress it enough don t allow kids under to see this film the target age for the movie is the range and that s who should see it it s definitely not for those under did i mention that this film is rated r however for those that do get a chance to watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friends to see it the next time 
it s terribly unfortunate that stir of echoes tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of s unsung treasures the trigger effect should be released little more than a month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir of echoes is more of a straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to a psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business stir of echoes is more conventional and predictable in its final twist and where the sixth sense was disturbing stir of echoes is just plain scary i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir of echoes opens with a cute six year old boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking a bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there finally he asks does it hurt to be dead apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn t the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon a chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hard working wife one night while at a party with their closest friends tom convinces maggie s new age sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he wouldn t normally see including a deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months seeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she didn t expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees stir of echoes isn t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and is not only effective on a technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working class family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe s dream with the fishes are top notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through does not try to stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet in a masterfully done entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching a movie screen from inside a theater which is also showing a movie screen in a theater telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly construed as this one truthfully this set piece and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen having loads of fun with her small role as maggie s sister lisa illeana douglas s to die for her last great character is a delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom s visions of the girl she remarks i wouldn t be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she s dead gives one pause also of note are jenny morrison s intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in s whatever as morrison s grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential and it doesn t what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically written characters stir of echoes isn t as good as the sixth sense but why should it need to be both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is a spinetinglingly good horror film 
you ve probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over keeping the faith it s a fluffy comedy thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer regarding two moral topics love and religion and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head on as youngsters brian finn jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio while their friendship progressed anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support so neither would feel excluded but tragedy soon struck as anna was forced to move away now adults brian edward norton and jacob ben stiller hold similar but contrastive jobs the likable and kind hearted father brian is a catholic priest while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi on the basketball court they refer to themselves as the god squad in the relationship field brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory everything changes when anna jenna elfman returns to new york to visit her childhood chums now a workaholic she devotes endless hours per week to her business but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail there s bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult but keeping the faith is open entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b edward norton has emerged as one of the finest most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the thriller primal fear after shockingly bitter roles in american history x and most recently david fincher s vicious fight club a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice not in the least norton slips into the director s chair for the first time with keeping the faith and here his incisive resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg weighing every aspect it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut in addition norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian generating a thoroughly likable screen presence stiller the zipper guy from there s something about mary is firm and funny boasting a fully ripened comic maturity elfman s perky repetition can grow tiresome such is occasionally the case on tv s dharma and greg but she seems perfectly rambunctious here the remaining cast members offer fine support from anne bancroft as jacob s animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice keeping the faith is the perfect date flick though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general there is turbulence during the process of lift off as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead once the film does settle in it is often funny and always cheerful stiller norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities we enjoy their interaction understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true this is excluding the ending which is acceptable and all but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements nonetheless a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won t wipe the smile off your face nor anyone else s in the audience keeping the faith is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion aww what the hell the quality is not quite heaven sent but this little charmer could revive our faith in a potentially tired filmmaking genre 
note ordinarily moviereviews org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as spoilers however being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews org feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations plot giveaways will appear in the following review if this bothers you please note the star rating of the film and stop reading now what does it take to play carnegie hall practice it takes two hours for music of the heart to play carnegie hall both figuratively and literally like the children it portrays the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show stopping performance at the legendary concert hall roberta guaspari academy award winner meryl streep has two kids a husband who left her and violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors that is the pattern like plot of this production ultimately the film chooses a zero sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all time high when the men in her life finally vanish the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful roberta s character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat also lacking depth is the film s bad guy a narrow minded music teacher josh pais who rejects roberta out of principle the movie never explains exactly which principle that is and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around the next minutes of the film are mediocre they are highlighted by one child s return to roberta s class coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can t be around anymore because my mom said and a glowing concert not knowing the running time you may expect the credits to role at this point but they don t instead the film uses the next minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent director wes craven known for his works of horror uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic but last night and roberta s two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father s absence the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie roberta s mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens predictably one of roberta s students is gunned down and killed off screen one thing the film does lack is subtlety the fact that a little boy was playing we shall overcome on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience of course in horror films the foreshadowing and between the line moments are meant to be overdone so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game even with all its flaws music of the heart is a beautiful film that is not an excuse for the movie s poor beginning but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage in december of a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history the performance included a dead on elvis impression robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies so how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa s favorite food this movie has an amazing finale 
 psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget third rate rip off but no this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria perhaps italian horror director dario argento s most consistently successful film what impresses most in re watching this surrealistic supernatural thriller is that argento s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near fully coherent narrative screenplays have always been his achilles heel confusing subplots gaping holes totally illogical incidents and reactions no question argento has always been a better director than a writer fortunately he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called suspiria de profundis the film s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance arriving at the school late at night in driving rain she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state what happens next and i don t make the comparison lightly is a murder sequence that for intensity shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock s infamous shower scene in psycho it s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock but with its baroque sets graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin this stunning sequence remains very much argento s own though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria s opening minutes the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour old matriarch from hell roles she does so well several more violent murders ensue including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is well i wouldn t want to spoil things now would i and the film s climax staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms has a gothic ghoulishness that s most impressive the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming and not just for the violence deep red and phenomena for example have been appallingly hacked about fortunately the cuts to suspiria about minutes in this version have not adversely affected the film the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done too excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region and the soundtrack it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else as it stands the use of goblin s music in suspiria is outstanding apparently argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer s overall experience even better see suspiria in a cinema where you ll get the added bonus of widescreen and the colours deep reds eerie blues a superb use of shadow and contrast the cinematography of luciano tovoli whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female is uniformly superb a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento s more surreal excursions the other most notable example being inferno on which bassan also worked suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors and it is fully deserving of its cult status the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated that s always been one of argento s shortcomings but overall this is a fascinating compelling example of italian horror 
shakespeare you hardly understood it in high school why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn t count on it if this is your attitude then i ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh s hamlet is probably not for you and you might as well stop reading right now if however you are a lover of the bard or at the very least are open minded about a challenging script read on for there is something rotten in the state of denmark namely the king has died and his widow the queen has wed the king s brother claudius but prince hamlet suspects foul play his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother s hands hamlet enlisting the help of his friend horatio conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery and the game is afoot the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers the hamlet castle s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings mirror panel doors and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second story loft costuming is equally grand drawing upon both history and imagination not quite the denmark of the s the characters attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars respectively in addition to directing kenneth branagh also plays the title character as the revenge driven royal heir branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows from the anticipation of seeing his father s ghost to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester to his eventual wrath branagh delivers in spades every scene truly revolves around hamlet as much a tribute to branagh s acting and directing as to shakespeare s manuscript hamlet seems to be a who s who of shakespearean trained actors so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself julie christie as hamlet s mother gertrude and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly as do many of the supporting players kate winslet as hamlet s lover ophelia does an outstanding job demonstrating the character s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness richard briers as ophelia s father polonius and michael moloney as her brother laertes are equally convincing nicholas farrell as hamlet s trusted friend horatio and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible in some cases this made for interesting scenes billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick whom hamlet knew quite well crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian and the result is a very funny scene however charleton heston whom many might think would butcher shakespeare is the biggest surprise of all as the player king the leader of a troupe of traveling actors he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story with sir john gielgud and judi dench but this is most unfortunate for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time his off camera speaking while gripping sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well voiced actor i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out and let the venerable actor have the attention unfortunately there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions jack lemmon an excellent actor just can t do shakespeare as marcellus the guard who sees the elder hamlet s ghost lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him gerard depardieu another talented actor is wasted when given little more than the utterances of yes my lord and no my lord in the role of reynaldo richard attenborough has a literally walk on role showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador i think he had two lines then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback type images this only works about half the time and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them you don t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar the high school english course in it you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king s english or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes 
in the stock market crashed and oliver stone s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses wall street lucked out in its timing the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had and though its kill or be killed approach to business was exaggerated that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan era businessman stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs evil tale relayed in the fast paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange critics and audiences lauded wall street elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic i m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone s output with its thin caricatures obvious sentiments and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen stone goes for broke in every scene the same could be said for nearly all of his works this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane it s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity rather than explore what these situations are really like i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative as they are presented in boiler room rather than laughably over the top these guys are salesmen after all not televised judges more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street the only possible solution i can muster is its release date and not just the timeliness of the greed is good subject matter the film was plumped down in the eighties a decade in which the one joke comedy rose to an art form and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept low result movies in my mind the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies but bad music bad hair and bad clothes maybe stone s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace boiler room is an equally well timed film with some similarities to stone s piece of crap they both feature a consequential father son relationship though boiler room s is much more subtle and touching and they are both concerned with the power of greed yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery smooth heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street boiler room is a message movie as well though at least until the end doesn t shove it in our faces boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash as i said this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn t been seen in quite a while not only do we want to be millionaires we want to watch other people become millionaires in our super judgmental power oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything when you have money you have it all and seth giovanni ribisi wants it all the easy way he s a well intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm the kind that sells junk stock whereupon he meets others just like him ben affleck is cast as jim the company headhunter who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko his job is to influence trainee s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood it s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b s that they re told to dish out to prospective buyers affleck s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin s similar character in glengary glen ross and that proves detrimental to the actor s performance affleck shouts curses and be littles his rookie employees just like baldwin minus the edge when alec played the scene he became the part spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are intellectual gangsters they aren t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes we drink up this world along with seth and watch him become seduced by it just like we might be as in all cautionary tales boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness i know this story we all do but it can work if it s told with intelligence and energy and that is how writer director ben younger tells it as a director of please excuse my french mise en scene younger has much to learn his style is sitcom bland but his writing isn t younger s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch his dialogue is like a junior david mamet despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script the brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying them into buying stock these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn t aware that he is one with the exception of affleck s brief appearances the performances are truly exceptional ribisi who has the edgy looks of a character actor is extremely potent here working his pale angular face and eerie plaintive stare for all their worth he conveys child like vulnerability his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren t going his way in some scenes and in others he s ferociously cut throat the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie ribisi is confident when it s just him and the phone but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father authoritatively played by ron rifkin boiler room thankfully avoids wall street like histrionics in the sales pitch sequences the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys those ploys are taught to seth by chris vin diesel a kind broker who alternates between seth s friend and his mentor diesl shines in his minor role this week i saw the sci fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the s and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the s nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can t have nia long as the firm s secretary a lone black women amongst many white men is ribisi s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets but develops into something more interesting the two make an oddly likeable couple long is smart and brash and ribisi is charmingly aloof at one point he says to her i m just lookin for some chocolate love it s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child like way it becomes sweetly endearing unfortunately towards the end the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy there is much crying hugging and sorrowful stares this is okay when taken in small doses but younger s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo hoo moments one following the other a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth s manipulations have on one of his poor victims it s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message that message being greed is bad yes it s patently obvious but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven t seen much of in the movies the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners boiler room offers neither extreme it gives us what is in between and for that i am thankful 
i hate to burst your bubble but after all the star power mega bucks screenwriters directors and cool trailers men in black is not the best movie of the summer it s pretty good in it s own right yes but i would probably split the best movie honors among face off spawn con air and maybe event horizon it s main problem is that it s quickly forgettable and i can t remember one truly good scene from it from con air it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt in spawn it was the living room hell conclusion at the end in event horizon it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell s forces and all of face off was pretty dang good but as for men in black the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches i remember it not for it s humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted and yes i did see mimic which is something i ll touch on in a later review back to men in black is it just me or does that sound funny i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the th grade and read magazines like wizard etc for those of you who aren t comic geeks wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars what the new yorker is to high society what boy s life is to boy scots okay that one was pretty pathetic few people know this but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was while not honest politician rare very hard to find this was after the release of the high grossing batman forever and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o donnell were being considered for the roles in the comic book there were no black men in black kind of weird huh all i can say is thank god they didn t cast chris o donnell i know i can t be the only person on the planet who thinks he s an annoying preppie little snot sorry my apologies to o donnell fans i actually had a th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him anticipating rather craftily that if the movie was a big hit it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely he decided not to sell them to me because they were innappropriate hmm so now you re probably wondering why i ve wasted about paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years good question i ll move on to the movie now as you probably already know will smith and tommy lee jones agents k and j respectively belong to a top secret agency known as divison or it s nickname mib men in black men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear and they re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they re here on earth not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the people in the world who haven t seen this movie but a basically big roach type bug lands in a redneck farmer s yard inhabits his body and attempts to destroy the entire universe not bad eh i have no idea why i just typed that i m not even really paying attention anymore the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black i found their main headquarters to be boring as were the cool weapons they had the noisy cricket just plain sucked no matter what anyone said and the movie definitely surprised me in tone although it probably shoudln t have it s director barry sonnenfield is known for black humor directing both addams family movies this movie was basically a black comedy not an action sci fi like i expected from the trailers don t get me wrong on what i think of this movie it s not bad i gave it it was mostly entertaining throughout it s run and had a very good ending although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it my diagnosis for this picture a good weekend rental but not worth a movie ticket of course the movie is now long gone from theaters but that s beside the point i think 
seen september at p m at rotterdam square mall cinema theater with chris wessell for free using my sony loews critic s pass theater rating good seats average sound picture unstable rounders is exactly the kind of movie parents don t want their kids to see it s not that it s a drunken orgy of sex and violence but because it s a film that flat out says you can make a career out of gambling and to take make things worse it proves this through its original fascinating story there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life this film starts off in the tradiational noir style introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing matt damon stars as mike mcdermott a something law student in present day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played damon narrates throughout the film but the entire opening scene is voiced over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting mike s about to go up against teddy kgb malkovich a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer but then again he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense the look in his eyes his slow movements his intricate mannerisms all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly groomed features but his narration is what brings it all together he never sounds like he s reading from a script nor that he s trying to embellish anything it just comes natural to him the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood from the smell of the air to the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards and all without sounding remotely trite immediately we get the sense that poker isn t for gamblers but for near geniuses with nerves of steel the game is a quiet war with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it comes to the game of poker all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit we learn only a little about mike both past and present presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues with over his gambling they go through a few break up make up cycles until mike s childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison it s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does technically the plot isn t unlike many children s sitcoms in which the good kid s bad friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives but both share a passion for out thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always takes the cards he s dealt and works with them sometimes they pay off i e his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other times they don t i e the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping on a single hand once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places from socialites mansions to taking the tourists at atlantic city to outwitting the gangsters that control it all everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything s a battle against the cards destiny deals one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge martin landou in a perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time matt s good at gambling but he s also got potential to be a great lawyer he could go professional as either but with one he could lose everything or win big but with the other there s stability but not much risk involved can someone who s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker playing then the ending is our test everything is told from mike s perspective but we re finally able to recognize some things on our own this makes the final against all odds showdown seem like just that it works just like the game it revolves around showing us some of the cards but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequences thereof what separates rounders from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end 
since their film debut in with the tightly wrought texas thriller blood simple joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic original and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood their films are highly stylized deeply embedded in a particular time and place and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances in the big lebowski their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award winning fargo the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski aka the dude the dude is played by jeff bridges one of hollywood s most underrated actors in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties he has shaggy shoulder length hair a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim and he wears mostly stained tee shirts long shorts and gellies without socks he smokes a lot of pot drinks a lot of white russians and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak john goodman and donny steve buscemi one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation but never quite makes it in one day the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski david huddleston this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife bunny tara reid owes a lot of people a lot of money the main plot and all its accompanying side plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money by the time all is said and done walter has become deeply involved as has the big lebowski s daughter maude julianne moore a feminist performance artist a pornographer named jackie treehorn ben gazzara and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in fargo the big lebowski plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers earlier efforts it shares their previous films strong sense of time and place as well as their send ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies lebowski has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made raising arizona such a hoot it has surrealistic dream sequences one of which involves a busby berkley like dance number that characterized the ending of barton fink and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded the hudsucker proxy the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins who has worked with the coens on three other films barton fink the hudsucker proxy and fargo deakins always gives the coens films a distinctive visual style and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude s main competitor jesus quintana john turturro or the strikingly manic dream sequences one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball s point of view if fargo was the coen brothers most restrained effort in years the big lebowski marks their return to over the edge filmmaking it is overflowing with style and attitude which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end the coens fill the screen with lighting set design music and hilarious performances from all the leads especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman who shows real comic timing in his untimely nam inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism with joel directing ethan producing and both writing the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world and they put them center stage to show that it s not just guys like the dude who are nuts but the entire planet 
oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with in a perfect world a civil action would be a breath of fresh air it s cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn t it s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book film isn t and the capper it has no distinct ending and the law in hollywood films is that above all else you must have an ending even if it s based on a true story a true story which hasn t yet ended you must supply an ending a false one but an ending nevertheless hell a civil action is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together and that includes the firm the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic yet it s also oddly and slightly unsatisfying weird this is in fact a steve zallian film not just the work of a hack and zallian is the director of the much admired search for bobby fischer didn t see it and writer of none other than schindler s list in short i like this guy and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories after all apart from the obvious it s a holocaust film and it s a spielberg film isn t schindler s list just a damn brilliant film not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study a civil action is the same way it s narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study and it s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong the main complaint of this film is that while yes it s an engrossing lawyerly tale it has no real ending and that s not necessarily the problem with the film it s that it s just kind of unsatisfying if this were a great film it would feel complete and still end basically the same way but this film just seems to end and i don t want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on imagine if you will being one of those the film is about looking forward to this film and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter just so the many won t bitch about what is essentially genuine but the fact that it just ends is not in all actuality what is wrong with it it s rather that zallian has chosen in the last half hour to adandon the traditional lawyer story and chose the other part of his story the one about the lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta who s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer brilliant because he s manipulative and he always wins it wishes to make it all about jan in the end but the truth is his change although nicely done is not full we see him suffering from a personal crisis and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart but in the end we don t fully believe it and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision the film choses an odd angle to go at a noble one but one that gives the film s conclusion that of incompleteness in the opening of the film we see him doing his old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases in short he s full of bullshit and we know it in the film he takes a case that is hardly desired a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river point one it s not of the usual criteria jan points out wickedly that dead or wounded children aren t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success point two it has been through several lawyers after turning them down jan changes his mind a muddled scene he stops his car on a bridge looks out is he feeling a sense of overachievement and he and his team of lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek and accountant william h macy head out to the town to do battle with the town s company they spend millions of dollars examining the land test the water what have you this is where stephen fry a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in wilde pops up thanklessly and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children and then unsuccessfully the workers at the plant they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company the eccentric jerome facher played by robert duvall more on him later on as we progress we get so involved in the way the story is being told which is engulfing everything around it including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland who lost her child who begins to have a personal crisis things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half as they are up against impossible odds the judge john lithgow is not only a strickler but a pal of facher the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify no concrete evidence is being found depsite the money spent to find it and they are quickly running out of money as macy mortgages everything he can including their homes and their office he slowly loses his sanity his meatiest role since oh fargo and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist in fact the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par owen gleiberman especially criticized the film for not being overly dramatic i suppose like a grisham novel this wouldn t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good he s seen as being still full of bullshit because he doesn t take stock in the cares of his partners and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out the final half tries to redeem this as must have been the point of making this in zallian s mind but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him and thusly receiving two speeding tickets we still feel that the big change in his life is that he s not rich and esteemed anymore the film s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case it s still going on you know but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life it only feels like half of that maybe even less and it s not travolta who does a great job here though never to be a truly memorable performance of his but rather zallian whose final chapter needs a rewrite up to then though it s an engrossing drama one of the best of the year in fact and one of the best lawyer films period the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted but rather it s about the lawyers the knights who battle eachother we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town but the reason it can t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find and duvall s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is facher is seen as an elderly man a goofy eccentric carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it eating lunches out of paper bags and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio and scold anyone who interupts him but look deeper and you see a master at work his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him and it s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way that s why i liked this film it s hard to put a pointer on you can never see exactly where this film will land and even when the credits roll you still aren t sure what to make of it call it the zallian effect same thing happened with schindler s list not that i m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman each film is so greatly crafted that you can t help but get involved in its broad storytelling interesting characters and most peculiarly the wit that comes along with it if only it felt totally complete like say schindler s list though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two it might have been one of the best films of the year and along with that a full breath of fresh air 
a costume drama set in the s england elizabeth is a lush romantic political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens the royal family so to speak are upset that a protestant should be crowened and not another catholic plus the new queen elizabeth i cate blanchette was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary s father the persecution over catholics and protestants isn t the only majority in elizabeth elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures and her lover joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love in order to rule successfully the country which she did for more years both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era and both feature a queen elizabeth i judi dench plays her in love or course yet i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love not just because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i but because i found blanchette a more powerful hypnotic sense for the role elizabeth also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough is my pick for the best picture of award it s a dynamic important breathtaking film of loyalty power greed and trust shakespeare would die for the book rights

metro i ve seen san francisco in movies many times there was s interview with the vampire and most recently the rock now yet again san francisco is the setting for this movie eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd he is their top hostage negotiator and the very best at what he does when his best friend on the force is killed by joe michael wincott in a terrific performance a psychotic demented jewel thief roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again meanwhile roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex girlfriend veronica while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who s an expert sniper and marksman michael rappaport despite the obligatory cop movie scenes does every cop new partner movie have to start the same way where the sgt assigns roper a partner roper confronts the sarge etc this film is still one heck of an explosive ride a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed and boasts some amazing car stunts eddie murphy shines in this tailor made role and for once his character shows depth and concern when confronting joe in prison you can feel the anger drip from every word michael rappaport is basically throwaway he serves no purpose except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day typical action escapist fare michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott s perfectly raspy voice i don t know what i do know though is that although metro is basically a typical action retread it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches the film is a triumph and an entertaining one at that it doesn t meander or trail off from its main character an enjoyable two hours metro is enjoyable witty action packed and fun and makes for a great action movie that s perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality 
usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug but not the big lebowski the new offering from the creators of s critical hit fargo is to say the least wildly entertaining originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother s movies and the big lebowski is insanely original it begins oddly enough when jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is mistaken for a millionaire jeff the big lebowski david huddleston who s wife bunny tara reid owes money all over town two goons out to collect on bunny s debt break into dude s house they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team steve buscemi john goodman respectively he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug he does this and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly also several great supporting roles john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus the coen s script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one if not they give this one a try its a little different

the ultimate match up between good and evil the untouchables is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry based on the television show of the same title the untouchables may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences some excellent acting a memorable score and a clever script the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order however as ness soon learns in order to stabilize peace you have to bend a few laws the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes the film begins with capone played perfectly by deniro declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl from this point we know capone is evil not only because he kills without hesitation but also because he is a lying bastard right from the first five minutes of the film de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs this developed hatred is before the film s hero ness is even introduced i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone the film only gets better from this point with the formation of the untouchables there is a group of men wearing long dark overcoats and hats they walk in unison and they only look forward as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films one that comes to mind is the matrix when neo morpheus trinity and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world wearing more futuristic outfits of the same s style the similarities between these two are countless the untouchables has some of the hippest bravest heroes in any action film the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone s army each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others elliot ness played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner is a character that surely grows during the course of the film he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be however as the film develops so does ness his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in sean connery who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role plays malone an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables malone acts as a mentor to ness he teaches him the chicago way to do things when they attack with a knife you attack with a gun connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone a young man who is just becoming a police officer as ness grows he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen also very similar to the matrix they are exciting and intense from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps the scenes are well thought out and well executed the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting great directing and great action some scenes capone and the baseball bat the train station have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid 
ok i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure yuck but it s not really too bad it has a lot working against it for me at least in addition to the above it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made for tv movie but longer and with bigger stars and you have to pay to see it it does win you over though even if it is painfully predictable just think about it two single parents with their cute kids are thrown together due to a missed field trip through a day of near disasters they cont inually meet get in one another s way cause trouble for one another and generally insult one another at every opportunity in fact they hate each other so much that we know that they are or soon will be in love the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples so this film is predictable just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman s model for this film will they get fired from their yuppie jobs will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex husband a drummer for bruce springsteen really is aren t they all will they finally kiss well what do you expect but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled especially when it is done with as much humour along with a lack of sticky sentimentality as it is in this film pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show one word of caution though this film is being billed in some places as a family movie don t let that stop you however i think most kids especially boys would be pretty bored by this move after all nobody gets killed and there are no explosions all in all a good non offensive date movie the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv broadcast a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
with a team of graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft s square pictures final fantasy inspired by the top selling game franchise is visually awe inspiring and groundbreaking no doubt you have never seen anything like this film and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting obviously the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail individual threads in the fabric individual strands of hair swaying wrinkles and pimples on skin incredible water effects overall the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue and the times when they don t sync perfectly really stand out since the animation is usually so dazzling but you won t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes as soon as you catch one the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering wow like the series of games final fantasy s plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind hironobu sakaguchi it s the year and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien phantoms whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors the often invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul for some unexplainable reason while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein james woods to blast the aliens with a zeus cannon dr aki ross ming na and dr sid donald sutherland plan to build a wave using eight collected spirits to counteract the phantoms and kill them off while the images serve the sci fi aspect of the film well the storytelling doesn t it s unfortunate because the plot seems so intricately thought out perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english except two americans wrote the screenplay nevertheless the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes why do these aliens feed on souls if they can pass through bodies and ships how can humans hurt them with guns what is so special about the spirits that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens worse yet the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science heavy star trek episode an installment of die hard or a sappy love story depending on who s doing the talking for the most part it s bearable considering the genre but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don t do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming who always has great cracks during tense moments but when the lights come up and the credits roll you re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked there s no question that the roughly million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film you d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more

an indian runner was more than a courier he became the message he was carrying what danger is a bear to a message i used to think sean penn was an immature arrogant photographer punching madonna marrying loudmouth but all that has changed now the guy has grown up and that s not all it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director if this film is any indication one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper but no this film is about a real struggle and the victories and defeats are not simple penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters without unnecessary rush or flash the focus of the story is two brothers david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer viggo mortensen is the wild brother whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can t name much less resolve the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared the film is unobtrusive simple direct plain and sincere it isn t exactly perfect but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems this is a good film without big budget sets or big name stars pushed into your face in fact i m reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing there were perhaps others at the showing i saw i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified though there are a few free form sections which also work very well the obligatory s music seemed a little cliche but what are you going to do this movie does take place in the s after all in my opinion it is worth full price admission 
 i d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation from elmer gantry on we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church well think again for the apostle which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister and by implication all the rest of organized religion instead it gives us a highly devout man who certainly has his foibles but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god and arguably just as surprising the good spirited film is no comedy even if it does have humorous moments instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures when in the privacy of his attic robert duvall as texas preacher euliss sonny dewey argues sternly with his lord the scene shares a kinship with emily watson s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves s most powerful scene the body of the story starts with sonny s coming upon an horrific auto accident which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters with his well worn bible in hand sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident s dying victims the scowling police officer orders him to go away and after he has tried to work his miracles sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord s work robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film s director writer executive producer and chief financier rarely has a movie been such a labor of love with a white suit peach colored shirt and tie and dark sunglasses sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher duvall has every movement down pat even when he is walking down the street the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy he dances and claps all the way sonny s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep voiced black orators but his rhetoric is always competitive i may be on the devil s hit list but i m on god s mailing list he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent and they lap it up people jump up scream praise the lord and mean it the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable but sonny is no saint it turns out that he has a wandering eye which angers his wife jessie played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny s church leaving him unemployed sonny letting his temper get the best of him does something foolish which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever the bulk of the film occurs in a small predominately black church in louisiana which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church one way road to heaven holiness temple with an enthusiastic flock in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e f the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church he asks his members to tithe but he gives all of his money and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks a man who can t stand to be still he tells one of his friends i quit school because i didn t like recess in his new town he meets toosie miranda richardson who like him has a family that she hasn t seen in a while his romance with the separated woman like the rest of the film doesn t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show s many surprising scenes again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take although it probably couldn t have ended any other way the movie does wrap things up nicely and don t miss the sweet epilogue during the film s closing credits a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film the apostle runs a little too long at it is rated pg for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up 
james cmaeron s breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok for those of you who do not know the plot in machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed however some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor to stop connor the machines send a terminator arnold schwarzenegger back to to murder connor s mother sara linda hamilton and thus prevent connor from ever being born in response the humans send a protector kyle reese played by michael biehn images of machines and of humans reliance on machines dominate the film even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of will become the ruthless hunter killers of humans continue to use the machines in the climax of star wars luke relies on the force alone his own spiritual power to destroy the death star in the terminator however sara must use another machine a giant hydraulic press to vanquish her enemy cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable and he s not happy about it unabated technological growth brings about the terminator s other obsession the apocalypse we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la children watch the flames in a burning television when the terminator arrives in an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him even though the future is not set there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence all sara can do is await it cameron doesn t wimp out like he does in terminator the end of the world is the human race s own fault too after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place back in when the cold war was still in full effect the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war another obsession of cameron s these days one can read a criticism of machine like behavior in humans true humanizing touches are put into paul winfield s and lance henriksen s detective characters but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in la from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist unstoppable merciless obdurate we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger s later works eg commando but fear him cameron and hurd s script basically depicts a one hour and forty five minute chase taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese s intentions cameron directs the film at a rapid kinetic pace either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving usually both occurs the violence is not particularly graphic temple of doom s heart pull scene outgrosses the terminator s but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective for a low budget film the terminator s special effects and art direction especially in la are remarkably well done special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen one thing that doesn t hold up after all the years however is linda hamilton s hairdo 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned east meets west in mulan the latest installment in disney s parade of annual animated feature films an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass market commercial sensibilities this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years but falls short of actualizing its potential though not for lack of trying in many respects mulan is among disney s most mature efforts skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized the imagery of a pillaged village neatly encapsulated in the form of a child s discarded doll is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars and mulan s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy bloodless method imaginable yet how often does a hollywood animated film long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner in an instant idealistic mulan s innocence is lost and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending the film based upon an ancient chinese fable centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger edged teeth although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western european fables and literature for decades disney s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere story intact to some neutral territory and revels in its east asian roots aside from a predominantly asian american cast providing the film s vocal work there s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes invoking pseudo asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary and i can t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors really included karate chopping blocks of stone in two it s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately it s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan s land at its core the film is a tale of heroic adventure and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour perseverance nobility and courage as such animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand in hand with visual purity scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action such as mulan s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments particularly during our heroine s character defining opening half hour it s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation the friendly animal sidekick the colourful array of supporting characters into the mix where it goes slightly awry off to battle mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little lucky cricket who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience friendly comic relief they re affable presences and not precisely ineffective reasonable amounts of humour are elicited and eddie murphy who voices mushu is amusingly earnest but amidst all the high melodrama the effect is mildly jarring and from a storytelling perspective questionable in its necessity at training camp mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits easily characterized simply as the short clown the skinny clown and the big clown who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness and in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns she grows a certain fondness for a handsome square jawed young captain shang everybody needs love even ancient chinese warrior princesses but not necessarily in this film the romantic angle which lets the air out of the sails of the story s neo feminist underpinnings lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation another staple of recent disney animated films a cache of hummable little ditties has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness composed by matthew wilder none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing and one i ll make a man out of you unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable only reflections an early ballad of lament proves to be a song of any consequence serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga one of musical theatre s most wondrously pure voices nonetheless mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork the computer generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive while the blatantly child friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film they re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable briskly paced with a smart energetic heroine and filled with high adventure the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter

review ghost dog the way of the samurai cast forest whitaker henry silva cliff gorman john tormey gene riffini victor argo tricia vessey isaach de bankole camille winbush director jim jarmusch writer jim jarmusch rating good shot stars languid yet pointed and focused ghost dog the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek ultra cool cinematic image of the hitman juxtaposing the samurai s honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american italian mafia it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor s precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber dinosaur like to function in the modern era director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit using a palate of bleached colors jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film he doesn t cater to audience expectations of hyper colorized stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies the action is presented in flat brutal codas bullets have permanence death has consequences the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty it is an anti movie of sorts there are few photogenic empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with this isn t a film that lovingly holds your hand there are dark contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder just so asserting itself for all to see the fulcrum for the movie s thematic balancing act is ghost dog a mafia hitman a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms unlike the sleek muscular killing machines one is accustomed to we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly replete with chapped dirty hands and rumpled clothing he wears a hooded sweatshirt which he often pulls over his head giving him a monk like appearance there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal he uses old worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical efficient and pleasureless fashion ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book which he reads daily hagakure the way of the samurai life consists of simple pleasures for him ice cream warm rooftop naps and good books ghost dog lives as it were by the basic tenet expressed by his book one should start each day considering oneself as dead living atop an abandoned building surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends he craves nothing more as he puts it late in the film i ve seen all i want to see he exists in a spiritual world of the mind gaining moral sustenance from his readings ghost dog wasn t always as he is presented in several roshomon like flashbacks it s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan that samaritan being a foot soldier in an aging crime family ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man louie tormey as repayment after years of loyal service ghost dog is sent by louie to kill handsome frank a made man within louie s organization who has run away with the crime boss s daughter louise vessey ghost dog wordlessly executes his task witnessed by louise whom he spares as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon clutching a copy of the book roshomon in a bit of synchronicity louise loans the book to ghost dog upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family the mob bosses in turn put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog s world each time a character is shown watching a cartoon it s from the same era betty boop felix the cat etc a reflection of days gone by near the end louise is watching a cartoon that s a departure from the previously shown ones it s a bit of audacity on jarmusch s part that is nicely effective despite it s surrealistic nature as ghost dog floats through his world his life is touched by two people one is a sage little girl winbush who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities just as louise ultimately does by film s end the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer the other person in ghost dog s world is an ice cream de bankole vendor who only speaks french yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land jarmusch through rapper composer rza underscores his film with rap and reggae music which at first blush seems dichotomous but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars which in and of itself presents another paradox about ghost s dog s sense of honor the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation of all the cartoonish mobsters he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world gorman plays sonny a lieutenant who respects the old ways yet has a quirky affinity for rap music a love comically shown in several impromptu displays ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia he is a husk of a man assisted by two hearing aids who barks out advice without truly hearing what he or others are saying whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor s use his face ghost dog is reticent to speak often going for long periods without doing so the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent although the film has a deliberate pace some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon into a figure that garners sympathy if not a bit of pity 
he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother she inspires his love and his fear and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus he has a rudimentary grasp of language mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother s phrases he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door he is years old in body but a child in mind and spirit he is the premise for bad boy bubby a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby nicholas hope who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment etc etc then one day his father ralph cotterill appears his father is a shabby down at heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion unsurprisingly he is not thrilled with the way his boy has turned out he is however rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother claire benito and more to the point her ample breasts soon they are copulating on the dingy couch while bubby crouches confused in the next room acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest bubby s relationship to the world may be warped but it is at least stable the father s arrival disturbs his precarious balance causing an oedipal conflict which ends freud would be pleased in violence and as a result freedom bubby intuits from his father s arrival that the air outside is breathable he leaves the apartment his past his world behind so far so good the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby which bring us to this point are quite brilliant the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby s hermetic two room universe it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise bubby is used by his mother for sex he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins it is grim and savage and appalling but also strangely tender de heer having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby s does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes but simply empathizes he observes what it might be like the intensity of these opening scenes with their minimalist mise en scene immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world and owes much to david lynch s eraserhead not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack for thirty minutes the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own then de heer lets bubby out brings him into contact with our world and the film never quite recovers our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide where he wanders the streets and meets people where he suffers and learns and survives he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band how an anti social half wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages wisely he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group he is imprisoned and raped he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension he is loved by a motherly large breasted nurse carmel johnson it goes on by turns inventive silly tasteless endearing and sometimes all of these things at once de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world the tone shifts uneasily from fable to realism to satire and back again the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest the film is best understood as a kind of parable and indeed the religious implications of bubby s experiences are foregrounded icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother s walls bubby dons a priest s collar stolen from his father a church organ playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief the woman who redeems him is named angel the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby s mind do not fragment him into psychosis rather the world accomodates him and heals him although de heer s touch is at times overbearing bubby s salvation is touching what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ve humanist tale of improbable hope a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art and turning the band into a popular draw innocence triumphs bubby becomes a holy fool an idiot savant and graces us with wisdom it s a strange turn of events but by now we shouldn t be surprised because bad boy bubby ain t like other movies

when i initially set out to review this film my tag line was going to be you too can believe whales can fly then it was going to be you too can believe pastel triangles can fly then it was going to be you too can believe wood sprites can fly finally i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say there s a lot of flying going on in this film as our first host steve martin tells us the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in grossing somewhere close to in its original month of release subsequent re releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved and rightfully deserved to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before six stories high in an exclusive four month engagement from january st to april th fantasia can be seen at many imax theaters across the us after the engagement is over the film will be shown at regular theaters is the format effective for the film with a few exceptions yes the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven s fifth symphony it s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil black bat like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts eventually shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat like things and peace returns to the butterfly things though this segment isn t very story driven some of the images are very visually strong especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things who are all outlined in blood red colors begin to overtake the skies the next segment is set to ottorino respighi s the pines of rome in this segment some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack he is finally saved by another liberating shaft of light and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the oceans of clouds again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whales are involved reportedly the whales as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences are shown as actual size the cgi whales look incredibly life like except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least of the eight segments is set to george gershwin s rhapsody in blue this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york there s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer an out of work sad sack that dreams of having a job a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife i won t go into how everything works out but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending unfortunately the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich s piano concerto no and is an animated version of hans christian andersen s the steadfast tin soldier a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind up clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he can t see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jack in the box jester the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina little does the jester know the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl although the ending has been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short some children may find the jester to be a little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set to camille saint saens the carnival of the animals this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original fantasia and it s the one that people remember most the sorcerer s apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasn t made to be presented on large format film considering it was shot full frame and exhibits large amounts of grain there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many plus screen theaters segment seven is set to sir edward elgar s pomp and circumstance march no and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character donald duck stars as an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn t make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear jerkers foisted on audiences these days powerful stuff segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last set to igor stravinsky s the firebird an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in a stunning spectacle the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path including everything that the sprite has worked to create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film the host segments are largely no pun intended throwaways although steve martin s clip is pretty funny be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment comes from of all people bette midler who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board pieces like flight of the bumblebee a take on the four horsemen set to wagner s ride of the valkyries and a strange segment prepared in the s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments for fans of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia is a perfect way to spend the afternoon the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material as i mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whales triangle things sprites can fly g 
in zoolander the world s most successful influential and intellectually challenged male model derek zoolander wonders is there more to life than being really really really good looking obviously the film s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature length movie out of his hilarious vh vogue fashion awards short film subject can there be more to this film than being really really really silly no of course not and it never aspires to be anything more much like derek zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie it s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy and it never produces any gut busting laughs except maybe a scene when derek s model roommates all die in a tragic gasoline fight accident a riotously funny take off of tommy hilfiger ads but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles wild characters and performances and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused better yet this exaggerated version of the original three minute skit is only blown out to an efficient minutes just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu will ferrell drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed enter derek whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel owen wilson takes the spotlight on the trail of mugatu s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries stiller s real life wife christine taylor and she s hoping to use mugatu s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme much like the austin powers films zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today wilson is hysterical as the young vain hansel ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant freakish mugatu in the same way dr evil upstages everyone in austin powers jerry stiller ben s dad who s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld makes a priceless turn as derek s slimy agent maury ballstein even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged large assed masseuse as for ben stiller it seems his derek has one gag he s stupid which plays out in some uproarious one liners unfortunately taylor seems out of place and out of her league here maybe it s just because i can t stop seeing her as marcia brady who she played in both brady movies making her unbelievable as a dowdy brainy plain jane who hasn t had sex in two years she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo who would ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role while zoolander is hardly highbrow its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days zoolander s no masterpiece but a very worthy distraction 
i know that funnest isn t a word fun is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective but that s the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie i ve ever seen so to hell with webster s chicken run is one of the funnest movies i ve seen in a while i can t remember the last time i ve seen anything funner the chickens at tweedy s farm are up to something living in a concentration camp like atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box one night a brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farm s egg selling plan for a pie selling plan she orders a huge pie making machine cackling chickens go in pies come out what sort of pies chicken pies of course co director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and a close shave the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and a close shave owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming with co director peter lord park has created a similar creature in chicken run the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for a quick reference to the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement thing is the film doesn t feel like it s been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners of war movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all it s worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is but they re chickens so it s funny to us another thing that helps chicken run and most of park s films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing there are references to the great escape obviously and stalag the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom there s even a nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in a little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson s nationality and film history the braveheart reference is a hoot if you catch it when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution consider this since july of last year i ve seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they re parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run doesn t lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene if you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it s understood and as a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment of this movie doesn t require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it s hard not to fall in love with every one of them ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung ho veneer the characters inevitable romance doesn t feel contrived but sweet poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn t any help jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs a hen that runs away with most of the best one liners all while perpetually crocheting a sweater and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence they even come up with an inspired riff on something that s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as a delightful surprise the film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation is first rate remember that this was all done the old fashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail as in such top notch family fare as a bug s life or toy story chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but a active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details anyway the movie s just a boatload of fun funnest damn movie i ve seen all year 
there is a scene early in soul food george tillman s comedy drama about a large african american family and the ordeals they go through during a crisis that caught me completely off guard during a wedding the groom is flirting with some tramp and in an attempt to to prevent a scene his mother in law played by irma p hall comes to the rescue the way in which she does this makes me think irma p hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now however this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them vanessa williams vivica fox and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life williams is teri a successful lawyer who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career fox is maxine the strongest of the sisters which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad who narrates the film long is bird a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving at the center of everything is irma p hall as big mama jo every sunday the family gathers together for dinner at mama jo s house there is lots of conversation lots of laughs and the occasional controversy mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should she is stern and disciplined but also caring and forgiving everything is going fine until a tragedy befalls mama jo all of a sudden a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family it gets so bad sunday dinner is even cancelled without mama jo s guidance there is noone to keep the family together which frustrates ahmad miles and maxine s marriage begins to fall apart as he focuses on his music and flirts with the troublesome faith lem s temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him and teri tries to prevent maxine s efforts to sell mama jo s house the third act of the film deals with ahmad s attempts to patch things up he decides to take over where mama jo left off and tries to get the family back together for one more sunday dinner the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding with special notices to irma p hall and brandon hammond hall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie brandon hammond is an actor with a bright future he is wise enough not to play cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing except maybe an odd flashback sequence the dialogue is beleiveable and funny and then there s the food tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food and it indeed looks very tasty i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year 
naturally at the core of leon gast s when we were kings is the fight itself for what a fight it was thanks to the business savvy of don king an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman fans were treated to an round battle of endurance and strategy as much as brute strength that immediately entered boxing lore with the benefit of the first hand recollections of that old ex pug norman mailer this classic conflict is brought back to life but when we were kings tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary gast could hardly choose otherwise considering the vocal uncompromising politics of muhammad ali a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam ali opens gast s film with a forceful swipe at the united states when ali hollers damn america the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury no viet cong ever called me nigger ali reasons despite showcasing ali s proud unequivocal politics one of the most impressive features of when we were kings is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion listening to the film s numerous commentators it is clear that the geographic location for this rumble in the jungle is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage a coming home to africa foreman reminds us that africa is the cradle of civilisation fair enough but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu a brutal dictator while ali respects mobutu s ability to forge an independent african state mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well stocked torture chambers mailer s insights are lost on most of the film s commentators george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo rather than the newly christened zaire with admirable restraint gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire s squalid ruling elite mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power don king resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the messiah label attributed to him by a loyal disciple passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity understandably foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal he may be as one sympathiser notes blacker than ali but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali the thuggish mobutu and the tacky huckster don king africa zaire inspirational leader or vicious dictator all is left undifferentiated unconsidered in this optimistic celebration of black unity little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali s opponent wasn t white admittedly these issues are only hinted at rather than substantially explored the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves in their own time there is just too much to cover too much that is truly worthy of celebration for a protracted political analysis to be justified the excitement of james brown and b b king in concert for instance and of course there s always ali to consider as he shamelessly and hilariously hams it up in front of the camera shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another we gonna get it on coz we don t get along doubtlessly considering the multi faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover the makers of when we were kings faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues and what personalities best deserved their attention fortunately by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event 
tone alone cannot sustain a film but it can go a long way if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story it scores immediate style points when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly literary what s eating gilbert grape is such a film it s a rich memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence gilbert grape johnny depp is a young man living in rural endora iowa facing incredible responsibilities as the man of the house since his father s suicide gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie leonardo dicaprio and help care for his extremely overweight mother darlene cates gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky juliette lewis a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down as he spends time with becky gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing slowly his resentment builds until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people director lasse hallstrom my life as a dog and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges screenplay based on his own novel endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real minor characters like crispin glover as the town s mortician are vividly realized and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen s desperately unhappy housewife one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off key high school band not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false the same can be said of the character of gilbert it s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line when becky responds to gilbert s description of his father with i knew someone like that once gilbert is a man harboring an ever growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty in one scene he allows local children to look at his mother through their window displaying her like a side show attraction his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie s repeated chants of we re not going anywhere but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer and it becomes clear that he is following in his father s footsteps in this regard johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface but he never gives in to one dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny joon and edward scissorhands depp s performance is overshadowed however by leonardo dicaprio s astonishing oscar nominated supporting work as arnie he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard pressed to spot a flaw darlene cates a first time actor brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert s tortured mother and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert s sisters only juliette lewis doesn t quite click playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion but it never lost me thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast this release proves well worth the wait 
my summer was recently saved by two very different movies on opening night i saw american pie and laughed like a moron then a few nights later i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman s greenfingers even though it didn t feature a trip to band camp girl on girl action or seann william scott however i felt just as good leaving american pie as i did after leaving greenfingers which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs clive owen of croupier after spending roughly half of his life behind bars he is transferred to a more lenient facility edgefield the picaresque rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges at first briggs doesn t want to be there he s used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone however his ailing roommate fergus david kelly of waking ned devine wears briggs down through his benign nature the two become friends with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers after the prison s governor warren clarke reprimands them he s awed at what briggs has accomplished and he s struck by an idea briggs fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison s grounds greenfingers which is inspired by actual events becomes a bit like a sports movie after that despite their differences the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game in this case a prestigious garden show one renegade in this case briggs will prove to have talent of course love will also rear its head no not prison love to hershman s credit he doesn t pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs like last year s lame marijuana comedy saving grace i had to keep pinching myself when i didn t see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies or the men giving high fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers the movie deals with people and scores on that concept it s wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman s last stand in the shawshank redemption owen s bedside scenes with kelly who lends the film a human touch are a marvel to behold emotionally gripping without being sappy written by hershman greenfingers contains plenty of laughs most come courtesy of helen mirren who shines as the world class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose natasha little when she starts dating briggs the mother can t believe what he ll do if her daughter burns the sunday roast nothing is forced in greenfingers the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines primrose and briggs relationship takes awkward steps even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield it s done for reasons of loyalty not because the movie requires him to do so after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america s sweethearts and the princess dairies it s an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well 
well i know that stallone is years old now but in daylight he doesn t look it daylight is a great disaster movie if you ve seen cliffhanger you ll know stallone s character already a guy with a bad past but is in the right place at the wrong time a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying very flammable toxic waste a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball and what a fire ball it was stallone a former emergency medical service man is chauffeuring a rich couple around when they reach the outside of the tunnel before the explosion then minutes into the movie boom from here on the plot takes a back seat and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat there are a few melodramatic parts here but they tend to work out well there is no general antagonist in this film but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that daylight is a great film i saw a non matinee showing of it and i thought it was worth every penny the characterizations are mostly flat one dimesional but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters rob cohen dragonheart does a great job with this film 
the most common and in many cases the only complaint against francis ford coppola s masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder ages martin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more down to earth vision of mafia in mean streets movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime unfortunately for scorsese his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime this film was goodfellas epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of s goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi who would co write the screenplay for the film the book as well as the film chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill played by ray liotta irish italian criminal from new york at the age of he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero played by paul sorvino local mob boss and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands after couple of years together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito played by joe pesci he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway played by robert de niro three of them spend years as best friends and associates gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history wealth influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen played by lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities domestic abuse arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business but the perfect world of wiseguys gradually begins to fall apart tommy s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence jimmy s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and finally henry s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history based on some notorious real life events the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens scorsese also manages to break viewer s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material scenes that depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed and murder in all their uncompromising reality but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience with the use of ironic soundtrack manipulative shots character s dialogue or narrator s commentary goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era even if we don t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker first we might notice unusual structure of the plot relatively minor subplot is used as movie s ironic prologue then instead of single narrator scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards this multiple points of views both in terms of narration and various subjective shots only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy listening s pop songs while depression paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late s and s but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed however thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people such scenes although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings became very popular among other directors in s fragmentary character of the screenplay which doesn t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese he uses this structure of film to experiment and most successful of such experiments is hilarious a day in life segment near the end of the film another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents the most respectable among them is robert de niro but his character who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues joe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy and his lines including ad libs probably represent the most memorable element of the film ray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesn t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film liotta s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thugs liotta on the other hand improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction lorraine bracco is on the other hand very effective and believable as karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave as a combination of clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time because of this achievement and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of s 
steven spielberg s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film spielberg ever the student on film has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest and most powerful entries he also managed to cast this era s greatest answer to jimmy stewart tom hanks who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle for about out of its minutes saving private ryan is flawless literally the plot is simple enough after the epic d day invasion whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular capt john miller hanks and his team are forced to search for a pvt james ryan damon whose brothers have all died in battle once they find him they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home accompanying miller are his crew played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi davies and burns are the team sent to find one man and bring him home the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary literally there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film s first minutes spielberg films almost the entire movie without music leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion and they do to perfection the sequences in france all of them beginning with the battle and ending with the battle are fabulous especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides trying to save private ryan there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences this is what coppola was looking for in apocalypse now but couldn t create the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world with his comic timing dramatic flair his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears hanks is this country s finest actor and he proves it here however spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time spielberg creates minutes of purely worthless film the sequence involving army chief of stafff george marshall and mrs ryan is decent but doesn t hold up to the rest of the film relying on wartime cliches to power it but that is forgivable what isn t is the bookends of the film the cemetary sequences the first one is quite good a decent introduction into the lives of these men the last sequence is atrocious the forced emotion accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film these flaws are what downgrade ryan from the greatest film of our era to the greatest war film of our era spielberg should have trusted his own material and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie to end his masterpiece right there the use of the flag though patriotic is in contrast to the movie s theme the power of the bulk of the film however is astonishing spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art that persists even after first viewing of the film is extraordinary this is the film of the year 
ingredients down on his luck evangelist church synopsis sonny dewey robert duvall is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife farrah fawcett in bed with another guy in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy s head and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder and estranged from his wife and two kids to atone for his sins sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature the apostle e f as the apostle e f sonny s main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple but sonny knows his time is short one day the police will find him opinion this movie is a thought provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms i believe that robert duvall who is the producer director writer and main star of the apostle deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film duvall s portrayal of a true believer is authentic superb and inspired it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion as well as a portrait of a fallible complicated man driven by his beliefs incidentally in real life duvall was just as driven in getting the project underway since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost years before duvall was able to get it done paying for its production with his own money about five million dollars in terms of hard hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film similarly those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought provoking experience on the other hand the apostle s main strength duvall s preaching is also what limits the apostle s target audience in terms of plot and pure entertainment value the apostle is definitely not for everyone teenagers action fans comedy fans and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church in other words the apostle is a four star performance but with a very limited audience 
capsule this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii life in a japanese prison camp to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone s taste to more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law during world war ii of course the one goal was winning the war this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal when the japanese had captured prisoners they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output while the germans not known for their kindness in those days had a mortality rate among captured prisoners of war the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story perhaps for fear of offending the japanese there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps certainly there was david lean s the bridge on the river kwai there were some low budget british exploitation films and that was about it then there were tv series a town like alice and tenko lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for years the dean of the chapel at princeton university the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad it turns out to be a grim joke one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves beating and torture are commonplace events men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable however unlike as in kwai the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital called by the prisoners the death house so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail laying machine this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies the japanese believe that the individual is nothing that conformity to group s norms is all that gives a life meaning conformity is purpose before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story if the british with one american by the way and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story it is neither it is a stirring and believable account of camp life the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow this serves a double purpose for cunningham it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat it also creates a distancing effect the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience i rate it a on the to scale and a on the to scale 
once again the battle is dreamworks versus disney earlier this year the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end of the world asteroid flicks deep impact and armageddon here we are now just a few months later and they re at it again with dueling bug movies antz and a bug s life what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution i mean come on what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer animated films about bugs as was the case with the meteor movies disney has come out on top though antz is a likable movie a bug s life is far superior in fact this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz i became immersed in the world of a bug s life while antz just made me scrutinize everything but it s not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison a bug s life is a remarkable film in its own right and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer animated film about bugs in fact it s one of the best films this year it s smart subtle and funny but it s also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining i haven t had such a good time at the movies in months it tells the story of an ant named flick voice by dave foley he s a nice guy but he s also a troublemaker the ants spend all season putting together the offering a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers just before the grasshoppers come flick accidentally knocks over the offering and ruins everything for the entire colony the grasshopper s leader hopper kevin spacey is enraged and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer or they re all dead flick feeling responsible for this sets off to look for help he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them he heads to the city the city being a house a few miles away where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs a ladybug denis leary who is spectacular a black widow bonnie hunt a caterpillar joe ranft a butterfly madeline kahn a rhinoceros beetle michael mcshane and a stick david hyde pierce also giving a hilarious performance flick doesn t know they re actors and they don t know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position the most obvious element of a bug s life is the quality of animation created by pixar the same people who brought us toy story a bug s life has some of the most amazing visuals i ve ever seen the bugs seem to inhabit a three dimensional space and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action this is a lush colorful world full of life and imagination the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives matches bottlecaps tin cans etc and make them active objects in the bugs world is innovative the film is also mercilessly exciting particularly in a superbly staged scene involving our heroes escape from a bird a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening but the makers of a bug s life know where the importance lies story and characters flick with solid voice work from foley is a great guy to lead the story but the real treat comes with the circus bugs they re such a likable group of characters the standouts are the stick hyde pierce is so good francis the ladybug and the big fat caterpillar all of these bugs have more than a token personality which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs and it also keeps the tear jerking scenes from seeming obligatory in my review of antz i said that the film is a clever cop out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant like existence in concept a bug s life is basically the same movie except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn t like about it with such strong work in both animation and script a bug s life is nothing but a joy to sit through it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie but a bug s life is so good that i m sure it will find its audience after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies it s downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty 
 the faculty the heavily hyped and advertised sci fi horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez s desperado and s from dusk till dawn and screenwriter kevin williamson s scream and s scream is being called a cross between invasion of the body snatchers and the breakfast club and i don t think i could describe it any better than that the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common and then the science fiction aspect is added involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town the six characters as in the breakfast club can be easily labeled as a stereotype but as they are developed they become far more complex casey elijah wood the much picked upon nerd stokely clea duvall a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her zeke josh hartnett a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz stan shawn hatosy the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics delilah jordanna brewster the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist and marybeth laura harris the sweet n southern new girl in town although the characters are only slightly connected i e casey is delilah s photojournalist assistant marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely since they both don t have friends etc when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences the only people they can count on for help is each other even though they aren t really even sure if they can trust one another the faculty is another smart and pop culturally hip film from williamson although it does not equal up to his best film the original scream and rodriguez whose from dusk till dawn is still one of the more original genre films of the s williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions respectively that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no brainer the plotline of the faculty involving aliens taking over other people s bodies has been done quite a lot before from invasion of the body snatchers to the puppet masters to invaders from mars so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh and by setting the goings on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens they were mostly successful surely the conventions of the story are still the same and the climax was inevitable but there were a few surprises along the way including the question of who were the aliens and who weren t the epilogue was also a refreshing change of pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better the performances in the faculty were a treat throughout since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do one exception were the teens who aside from elijah wood are not very well known but they all aquit themselves nicely particularly wood the seasoned pro clea duvall and jordanna brewster as members of the faculty robert patrick t judgement day was creepy as the gym coach piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien and salma hayek as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold was very funny in a small role the standout in my opinion of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who after turning into an alien becomes the sex bombshell if there was any problem i had with the faculty it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the queen alien many of the faculty members disappear it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers although the finale is still pretty impressive and includes some showstopping creature effects especially for a relatively low million dollar budget although not one of the best horror or science fiction films i have seen the faculty is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released while the story is as old as the hills it is also in a way timeless because everyone i think has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right as if they really weren t human and by putting this idea in the setting of a small town high school it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers note the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading as it features r b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters in actuality he only has a small role as one of stan s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team if i were one of the heads from dimension i would change this advertising at once since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving 
 living out loud is the type of motion picture we don t often see it is a film about mature intelligent adults instead of the usual american film in which children basically dress up in grown up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven year olds judith holly hunter a fortysomething living in new york city has been having a difficult time with life lately she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband martin donovan who had been cheating on her she cannot sleep haunted by terrible memories often imagines off the wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers liz bailey queen latifah perform at a local club judith s life does start to brighten a little when one night when she gets home to her apartment late strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator pat danny devito a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other seeking comfort with the other person but while pat starts to form a deep love for her judith only wants to remain friends living out loud which was written by richard lagravenese the bridges of madison county who is also making his directing debut here is a wonderful film from beginning to end one that is honest genuinely funny and poignant the three central characters that of judith pat and liz are all written to be free thinking complex human beings and are all likable but flawed people who are constantly interesting as is the film itself one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen sometimes it results in comedy and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself reading a novel an older woman comes over to her mentions that that is a great book she is reading and then goes over to join her own friends as the woman sits down she looks over to see judith by herself and motions for her to come join them instantly we realize this was simply in judith s mind as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here hunter of course was brilliant in s the piano for which she won an academy award but in this film she is even better i think she finds the right note for each scene and holds it and devito has never had such a humanistic role before which i was surprised about usually he is used as the butt of a joke or as a caricature but in this film has a living and breathing sympathetic person to play topping it all off is latifah also a singer who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself and has a juicy natural supporting role as in some ways judith s role model another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived happy ending but in staying with its realistic tone manages to be upbeat but truthful the last shot is an especially powerful image nothing is said but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all the relationship that results between judith and pat is true to life and sincere as we watch these two people talk and get to know each other all that we wish for them both is to be happy even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved and as living out loud which is one of the best films of the year proves sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for 
will hunting matt damon is a natural genius for a movie character that s usually a death sentence it s a trait associated with what my brother calls too good for this world movies like phenomenon or powder forgive me for spoiling the ending but will doesn t die this is no formula movie in fact it s quite fresh and original it s a character study more than anything and that s not surprising considering it was written by two actors damon and co star ben affleck will works whatever kind of job he can get first he s a janitor then he works construction off screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him on screen he hangs out with his friends picking fights in robust romanticized hemingway fashion lambeau stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves a math professor learns that the janitor will is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics having confirmed he s not a fluke or a savant he does what he can to get will into the education system he is firmly rejected finally will lands in jail for one of his fights lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him will barely decides to go for the therapy over prison lambeau treats will like a son he s proud of and amazed by will s accomplishments in mathematics he encourages will and tries to give him structure knowing that with a little discipline he could be bigger than einstein will isn t really interested in academia he knows he would be the best in his field and therefore spend all of his time in an office explaining math to people like lambeau he would rather work construction which breaks lambeau s heart meanwhile will attends his mandated therapy sessions it s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau s a list will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade and how to keep them from affecting him shrink after shrink refuses to return after will s mockery lambeau s last hope is his old college roommate now a psychology teacher at a small time community college knowing that will is going to try to shred him too sean robin williams agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein true to form will finds sean s emotional weakness and attacks but unlike the other shrinks sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions like a foster mother with a fussy child sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride like the foster mother sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach robin williams is excellent in this role he s not an actor with a great range but in the right roles he has great depth in this movie as in awakenings there comes a point when the quiet shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling i have compared will to a foster child and that s not entirely fair emotionally he has a lot to learn but he is not a child he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants sean his girlfriend his pals and lambeau all help him grow but he didn t start out asking for or particularly needing help his exceptional gift singled him out and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama it s too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama it is emotionally engaging but it s not quite larger than life this isn t a problem per se but at times i didn t know quite how to take it but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow it doesn t just happen it takes a good script good acting and good direction good will hunting has all three if you are at all inclined to see it by all means go 
i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan i ve seen some of his films silkwood backdraft unlawful entry and while he gave adequate performances i have never been impressed with his work breakdown then is something of a surprise russell gives a fine performance as do most of the cast one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true but he does it no harm russell plays jeff one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy kathleen quinlan cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and left helpless and stranded jeff waves down a passing truck driver j t walsh who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help that it seems is the last time jeff or anyone else sees her breakdown has been compared to several movies george sluizer s the vanishing the original hopefully not his appalling hollywood remake steven spielberg s duel and any number of hitchcock films as with these breakdown does not for the most part stray down the conventional path of the american action thriller jeff does not become a gun toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife but instead becomes a scared confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on when we do find out what has happened to amy it does come as a slight disappointment if only because it s too early in the film i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment but this affects the film little russell as mentioned earlier is very good in his role and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo j t walsh as the possibly evil truck driver is terrific he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn t seem to know what to do with but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person one anyone would be able to trust which makes the plot that much more believable breakdown is what hollywood doesn t make enough of a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do indeed have viewers on the edge of their seats one of the most genuinely exciting films i ve seen in a long time 
earth is a harsh unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets indian and pakistani muslim hindu sikh parsee the story takes place in lahore which was indian before partition and pakistani afterward regardless of what its citizens might call themselves the action is seen through the eyes of lenny maaia sethna a young parsee girl but it is really about her nanny shanta shanta has a small circle of male admirers two of the men are suitors hasan rahul khanna a hindu and dil navaz aamir khan a muslim the others sikh hindu muslim are older some are married but all appreciate shanta who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das she also starred in deepa mehta s previous film fire the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water in an early scene the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears one of the men remarks jokingly that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along he is wrong the men make barbed little comments to each other spoken like jokes but with an undercurrent of fanaticism the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses it is easy to perceive in these squabbles the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter the group around shanta represents in a sense a united india and shanta herself the ideal motherland one which all love which inspires hindu muslim and sikh to live peacably together but the circle around shanta is sundered as is the state a sikh is persecuted hides then flees another man is murdered the group of friends will not meet again the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction a plate shattered on the floor a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child and most brutally when the tension escalates into violence a man is held down tied between two cars and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully the crux of earth s plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz his sisters are killed in brutal fashion by hindus because they are muslim dil navaz seeks solace from shanta and asks in desperation that she marry him but she loves hasan and tenderly refuses dil navaz s offer the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate despite the things he later does it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things the conclusion the consequence of dil navaz s transformation is rather abrupt the story earth tells does not end it just stops it is an appropriate finish giving us closure would have imparted at least on an aesthetic level a sense of resolution of satisfaction but there was no resolution for india and pakistan they have been at war on a small or large scale for decades since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus there is no healing to be had no closure on any level despite the needless tacked on ending with voice over narration from lenny as an adult framing the story earth is in some ways an unexceptional movie it does not reinvent the wheel following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas but deepa mehta s directon is assured and the issues she addresses run deep earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou s to live and tian zhuangzhuang s the blue kite did for china they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history such films strike me as inherently valuable even when flawed they may be biased or inaccurate but they bear the weight of human hardship and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other more inventive films often lack it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries the events shown may have happened decades ago but they still touch a nerve the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year in the near future india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen after seeing earth i have a much much better understanding 
an entertaining hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early s sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte who are on the lookout for love alice is mousy shy intellectual charlotte is bitchy out going and fun we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures and men all to the background of the local disco whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story alice and charlotte are both well written characters and the actresses who play them aren t bad aswell sevigny delivers an honest performance and makes the audience feel for her character beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining the dialogue is sharp and well written with many funny set pieces for example there s a great discussion about lady the tramp by the main characters the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun the direction is good bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes but their are slight flaws with the movie firstly although it is supposedly set in the s the characters are very very s the way they dress and act have a very s feel to them although the male hairstyles look slightly s frankly the s atmosphere just wasn t conveyed which is a shame also as mentioned above the film is too long and some parts do lag the charm of the characters do help these moments but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter the plot also side tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust which seemed out of place in this movie finally their are almost too many characters in the film and despite the running time the film never really spends enough time on them some of the characters are very slight which is a shame the conclusion while funny is also surprisingly weak and certainly not strong enough but despite these qualms the last days of disco is a funny warm movie which is certainly worth seeing and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the s worth a look overall rating review by david wilcock you know for kids norville barnes 
set in the late s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie less than zero american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie genre that ellis helped to create christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc e and his colleagues it seems that bateman is a serial killer and unfortunately for his contemporaries his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out but i soon forgot about the novel and didn t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore i picked it up and read it but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers the movie has a similar effect but at least it s less cryptic than ellis novel for once a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does as a result the film is immensely more entertaining lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films having picked up kevin smith s catholic rattling dogma and here with american psycho there is no difference screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women and initial reports said the film was unwatchable thankfully it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park bigger longer uncut side note co writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill fated acquaintance of bateman s who after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute proclaims that she s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner the writer director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy is a lesbian it s a subtle in joke and it s one i found to be pretty humorous despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up and comers including reese witherspoon most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos the real draw here is christian bale and his over the top performance as patrick bateman whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger one sequence in particular involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song hip to be square right before burying an axe in a co worker s head features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film side note despite the fact that huey lewis hip to be square and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film don t expect to see them on the soundtrack release huey lewis expressly requested that his song featured in a rather large set piece in the film much akin to the use of stuck in the middle with you in reservoir dogs not be included on any soundtrack release i m assuming that collins requested the same on a similar note whitney houston s cover of the greatest love of all is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source apparently houston wasn t as open about the use of her song as the others were a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film s release that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film don t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i m still undecided there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops old ladies and cleaning staff with equal gusto the scene seemed very dream like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying as an example bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence though comic throws the film off balance which i suppose was the intention other than the few flaws i have mentioned american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman s reality i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such it may not change anyone s life but it will certainly have an effect i know i will certainly hear hip to be square in a different context the next time i hear it r 
titanic is without a doubt the best movie i ve seen all year and believe me i m not an easy critic to impress the english patient was too long men in black was over hyped and several of the big summer releases were dead in the water thank god this film got delayed until december it s my christmas present titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years gone by and it is truly a stunning film while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized never taking your eyes off the screen nor checking your watch to see how much longer it s gonna last despite its hour plus running time as a friend of mine who s a true titanic buff said if someone doesn t like this film it s because they didn t want to truer words are hard to come by of course it doesn t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors james cameron who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time if you wish to argue that point with me look at his list of credits the terminator aliens the abyss terminator true lies etc still care to disagree not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film he also wrote produced and edited it and to show his true faith for the project he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs it s obvious he truly loves titanic the film opens with footage both real and fake of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the heart of the ocean which according to bill paxton s character would be worth more than the hope diamond today their search turns up dissapointly no diamond but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a year old woman named rose who claims to be the girl in the picture she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past rose s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl engaged to a rich man named cal hockley billy zane that she didn t want to marry her mother is pushy and obnoxious and cal hockley is arrogant they are boarding the titanic which is sailing to america and this is where she is to marry cal meanwhile a young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his italian friend danny nucci win two rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game they are overjoyed and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving for them this is their ticket to america to a better life for rose she is sailing to her doom the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt kate winslet and jack dawson fall in love it s the classic wrong side of the tracks story and does sometimes resort to a few cliches but as i said above the love portion isn t sappy and doesn t weigh the film down as some critics have said it s sweet and it didn t make me restless at all despite the fact that i usually hate love stories of course it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in including the enigmatic molly brown played by the talented kathy bates the captain of titanic bernard hill and so on all of these characters add an extra depth to the film and make it that easier to watch of course things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom the sinking is depicted realisticly and the effects are truly amazing it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either as people are portrayed as panicking pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats and drowning and dying horrible deaths the best part of the movie in my opinion comes at the very end when we flash back to the future the crew who at first had been skeptical of rose s story now are totally aborbed by her rose goes out onto the ship s ledge and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard we then see a dream of rose s in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream however i think it symbolized more i think it meant that rose had died and is going to a sort of heaven which would be the happiest part of her life her and her one true love jack if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this e mail me at venom hotmail com 
 footloose has only one goal in mind to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel good antics and i hate to admit it i fell for it the movie is about a teenager bacon who moves to a small town from the big city and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend lithgow he ends up falling for the preacher s daughter singer and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do as mentioned at the beginning of this review footloose is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama there are virtually no surprises and the writing is second rate so why did i enjoy it so much for one thing the cast is great kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role we re rooting for him right from the start and unlike most films of this genre bacon doesn t play him as the rebel without a clue sort yes he does rebel but he s also polite when he needs to be and he never broods the rest of the cast is equally impressive john lithgow seen here playing a normal guy for a change is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter by the end of the film we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character another nice touch is the music we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with sexual innuendos but that s not true at all the title track performed by kenny loggins is upbeat and fun during the final sequence i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing of course i soon realized that would be a little pathetic anyway footloose is a charming little surprise don t let the premise prevent you from watching it it sucked me in and it ll do the same to you 
america has finally gotten what it s needed for years a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma regretfully it s only a movie president james marshall harrison ford is fed up with terrorist activities teaming up with the russian government he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek a reactionary general ready to re unite the soviet union under his fascist reign during a celebration dinner marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists it s your turn to be afraid he declares returning home on air force one he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally ultra nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov gary oldman hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule which clinton says doesn t exist in real life but refuses preferring to stay and fight director wolfgang peterson das boot in the line of fire outbreak takes the over used die hard theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold your breath intensity if you can take your eyes off the screen steal a look at the audience everyone is totally engrossed the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder he does it so well when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead you know that he s over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time when korshonov executes passengers there is a frightening reality to it the guns in this film are deadly weapons not cartoons harrison ford has done one role for several years his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job realistically he s a man afraid but not afraid to act ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero indiana jones in the oval office he and oldman s archetypes match up perfectly the other roles also go to accomplished actors glenn close as the determined but unsure vice president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she s not quite ready for dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority i m in charge here is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance of course the politics are all wrong a cowboy president even down to his name with big guns shoots his way through problems much like the american collective memory of jfk s camelot the image is wondrous if you don t look too deep the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film but they work here no matter what political spin you put on the story the movie is an outstanding one i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country s future not a common belief nowadays now if we only can get ford to run for president just because one actor didn t work out as chief executive doesn t mean that a different one couldn t michael redman has lost count of how many years he s been writing this column years years while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes 
expectation rating a bit worse than expected mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull roger ebert gave it a four star review and while he is a critic that uses the full scale and i often agree such as dark city being the best film of he must have seen a better film i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter the landscape is snowy and cold and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner which also reminds me of fargo which i loathed one can almost sense the cold but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead instead raimi has made a more constrained film which probably is for the better this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots the movie also reminded me of affliction as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father and they see a chance for such a dream to come true this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field where an airplane has crash landed in the plane three men find the american dream in a gym bag affliction too was set in a snowy landscape it really seems very simple just hold on to the money until spring and if no one claims it they ll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true but the snow melts and so might several of the character s hopes as in return to paradise some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish the movie s biggest strength is that it fact makes sense i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story for example clear and present danger the biggest problem seems to over familiarization with the story the writer perhaps feels that he doesn t have to present scenes that are clear to him but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan even though the screenplay is by the book s author the movie is always clear on where it s going and always makes sense i m sue a lot was cut but really i can t remember what even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included the man only comes in on mondays but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many turns out well see the movie one should be warned against seeing the trailer it reveals several scenes from the ending moments which yes like in the book it is a downer several plot developments and much of the beginning but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer so if you re lucky you ll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie 
the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane billy played by michael keaton is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble christopher lloyd portrays henry an obsessive compulsive who requires that everything be neat orderly on schedule and by the books he thinks he s a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports jack played by peter boyle thinks he s jesus and finally there s stephen furst as albert a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four some when their psychiatrist dr weitzman takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium during a pit stop they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan the movie s charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively they never miss an opportunity to argue bicker or insult one another henry and jack for example fight over who s going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other michael keaton is well cast as billy he gives his cynical character considerable complexity as the divinely jack peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one dimensional character funny and fresh although stephen furst s catatonic character is cliched the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing while keaton boyle and furst are good it s christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance his body language for example the way he walks and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character lloyd s brilliant performance yields a pathetic moving and memorable character the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot 
it has been years since a terrence malick film hit theaters his new film the thin red line is a strange beautiful enigmatic mess of a movie the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast it is filled with above the title stars the cast for the most part gives great performances john travolta whose role is nothing more than a cameo seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve george clooney whose role became a cameo in editing gives a strange performance one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character s narration the rest of the cast especially nick nolte and elias koteas are unambiguously fantastic these actors and they are with two exceptions men were lured by the name of malick terrence malick is a cinematic legend he has often been called the j d salinger of cinema his two previous films badlands and days of heaven are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures after he made them he disappeared for years this film marks his return what he s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment the narration which fills the film and perplexes many not only lets us hear the narrators the characters themselves pontificate but also lets us hear such of the moment thoughts as i m scared the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult because the story is fractured many stories are here from the clash between the lieutenant elias koteas and the savage colonel a voracious nick nolte to the private ben chaplin who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box shook the box and poured the results onto a table this basically creates a mess but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed i m not declaring that the film has no structure while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about minutes of combat the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video ultimately malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature while some have said that the anti war message and pro nature tubthumping was juvenile it was done with so much complexity and thought that it cannot ever honestly be called childish after seeing the thin red line i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again 
with the abundance of trite recycled movies in the late s there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers never mind movie critics for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original perhaps audaciously perhaps purely thematically for the former you need look no further than director tom tykwer s incredible german thriller run lola run a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards lola a contemporary goth girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks and if he doesn t deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes he will be killed this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with marks or her boyfriend dies so she runs not just jogs sprints in hopes that somehow someway she ll be able to obtain the money and save a life from there as critic steve rhodes described it run lola run plays a bit like sliding doors on steroids with a non stop techno soundtrack wierd camerawork all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something indeed the movie is often outrageously exciting as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious very much like titanic run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film the way the movie is made for pure visual style tykwer s movie is breathtaking literally sometimes thematically it does leave something to be desired it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash while you are watching this will not matter running a breezy minutes this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted it is the equivalent of a roller coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers eugene novikov 
for many people procrastination isn t a problem to overcome it s a high art we ll do just about anything to put off a task when the deadline for this column nears it s the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and eventually hopefully sometimes there s a breakthrough and we actually get down to work amazingly it s almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away and then the next time we do it all again english professor grady tripp michael douglas is a master seven years ago his first book was a hit he s been working on his second a short page piece since then fearful that he can t live up to the first he can t bring himself to finish it no writer s block he s nearing pages with no end in sight now he s having a particularly difficult day the college s annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing their books during the first day his wife has left him his married girlfriend informs him she s pregnant and his agent is in town with a six foot transvestite in tow by the evening our besieged writer is driving though the snow covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk this could be a pivotal point in his mid life crisis and then there s the next morning there s a lot to like about this movie there are no huge explosions shattering glass or computer generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career in the world of what have you done for me lately he knows his second book has to be better than his first instead of finding out he drifts comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood he doesn t have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer tobey maguire james may be suicidal and psychotic certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn t interesting enough as the weekend progresses they are both forced to fully engage life that s the question they must face comfort or real experiences the film takes some interesting chances non traditional relationships are presented as matter of fact extra marital gay interracial professor student here they aren t judged merely choices the actors are all first rate douglas triumphs playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled unshaven and clad in a pink women s house robe maguire s disengaged alienation works perfectly here robert downey jr as grady s agent livens up his scenes director curtis hanson l a confidential makes a few missteps the women are underused frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara grady s married lover but we never understand much of who she is the chemistry between the two of them is non existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor but her character goes nowhere we never even see grady s exiting wife this is very much a guy s film the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others grady s alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film not him and sara as the boomers age expect to see more mid life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic eventually it ll probably become cliche but right now we ve got a winner i ll finish this in a second right now i have to grab some paint i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch up michael redman has written this column for so long that he s made mid life crisis a career choice 
buffalo is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci gallo plays a very troubled man who was sent to jail for gambling once out of jail he must visit his parents who he told he was married the truth is he isn t married to try to impress them he kidnaps a girl christina ricci from a tap dancing class to act as his wife the film is very cheaply made and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie but you don t need money to make a good film buffalo doesn t always stay with the realistic concept and sometimes goes through outrageous events gallo s parents played by angelica huston and ben gazarra are two very strange individuals the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits gallo and ricci arrive at his parent s house and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house ricci s performance during the scene at gallo s parent s home are very well done there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative they seemed very mediocre but they worked out just fine gallo s character is developed very well the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through his character goes through many many problems just like many people in real life this character seemed very realistic to me ricci s character is funny and different she doesn t care much that she has been kidnaped in fact she falls in love the man who kidnaped her ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves buffalo isn t all laughs though many scenes are very dramatic and depressing gallo s character was so realistic he was extremely disturbing some scenes are supposed to come off as funny but they actually seemed sad and real to life the film sometimes drags along not giving much material i really would have liked to see gallo s parents a lot more and i would have liked to see the characters developed more overall buffalo isn t as good as some people put it up to be the bottom line a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom 
every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio with every indication that it will be a stinker and to everybody s surprise perhaps even the studio the film becomes a critical darling mtv films election a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon is a current example did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened the plot is deceptively simple george washington carver high school is having student elections tracy flick reese witherspoon is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question way way high mr m matthew broderick sick of the megalomaniac student encourages paul a popular but slow jock to run and paul s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well for personal reasons the dark side of such sleeper success is that because expectations were so low going in the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be you can t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have election a good film does not live up to its hype what makes election so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from rushmore released a few months earlier the similarities are staggering tracy flick election is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play max fischer rushmore is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs and is involved with the school play the most significant tension of election is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student the most significant tension of rushmore is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student tracy flick is from a single parent home which has contributed to her drive max fischer is from a single parent home which has contributed to his drive the male bumbling adult in election matthew broderick pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he even gets a bee sting the male bumbling adult in rushmore bill murray pursues an extramarital affair gets caught and his whole life is ruined he gets several bee stings and so on what happened how is it that an individual screenplay rushmore and a novel election contain so many significant plot points and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other made from two different studios from a genre the high school geeks revenge movie that hadn t been fully formed yet even so the strengths of election rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick witherspoon and newcomer jessica campbell as paul s anti social sister tammy broderick here is playing the mr rooney role from ferris bueller and he seems to be having the most fun he s had since then witherspoon is a revelation it s early in the year it s a comedy and teenagers have little clout but for my money witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination and once campbell s character gets going like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium then you re won over one thing that s been bothering me since i ve seen it there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film i suppose that coming from mtv films i should expect no less but the film starts off light and airy like a sitcom as the screws tighten and the tensions mount alexander payne decides to add elements that frankly distract from the story it is bad enough that mr m doesn t like tracy s determination to win at all costs but did they have to throw in the student teacher relationship even so there s no logical reason why mr m has an affair when he does there s a lot to like in election but the plot similarities to rushmore and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven mark this as a disappointment 
i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater on a sunday afternoon when the movie was over and the audience was exiting i didn t hear one negative comment and i didn t have any to offer simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys simon ian michael smith and joe joseph mazzello and what destiny holds for both of them simon is a dwarf who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart surprisingly he does and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle simon thinks god has a plan for him a purpose for his life and his condition he just doesn t know what joe is an illegitimate child referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard who s mom ashley judd won t tell him who his father is simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem the people in the town don t really like him because he isn t natural even his own parents don t care about him and are disappointed they didn t have a normal son he is also harassed in church by the local pastor rev russell david strathairn and simon s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks the only person other than joe that really cares for simon is joe s mom who he also looks up to as a mother it would be just simon s luck that he would accidentally kills joe s mom something you are told at the beginning of the movie joe now motherless as well as fatherless feels the need to find out who his real father is with the help of ben oliver platt the local drama teacher and joe s mom s current boyfriend before her death he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny although not all of it is simon will also look for god s plan for him although he loses a little faith along the way starring in the first and last five minutes of the film is hollywood s newest dramatic actor jim carrey jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off and then tying it up just right this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway and he does a commendable job simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson this is his first film as director but he has written several films including the grumpy old men series he does an outstanding writing and directing job here the film s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat the cast is excellent joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance joseph is outstanding for someone of any age not alone someone who just turned ian michael smith in his film debut has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast i loved this movie it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year take your whole family to see simon birch it is a magnificent film an american masterpiece 
as any sociologist will attest your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives but if your upbringing is marred with violence hate and dysfunctionality then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome affliction explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood the man in question is wade whitehouse nick nolte here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me but as you scratch beneath the surface something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head we see that he is a mean tempered person he has a hard time taking control of his emotions which usually gets the better of him he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person but something is sparking a tendency towards violence he also has tremendous problems with relationships he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter but his bearish persona and stature alienates her he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl sissy spacek at risk she tries to remain true to him and supportive but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point finally he is spiteful and vindictive as a rejected father he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless as the town s only police officer he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain he is a prisoner and a slave to it he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him we learn that the answer is his father james coburn this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks to heighten the father s churlishness the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person very effective today wade s dad is quite elderly but still manages to instill fear into a grown man the influence that the father possesses is inescapable and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade the result is every son s nightmare becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity he s a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father coburn displays heft as the bitter dad but it s most certainly not saturday night friendly fare there s nothing light or fluffy about this film that may turn many moviegoers away but it s certainly worth noting that this is a well acted drama showcasing nolte s and coburn s raw acting talents 
while alex browning devon sawa waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris bad omens seem to surround him as soon as he buckles into the plane he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take off when the vision begins to come true alex bolts for the door dragging several students and a teacher in his wake the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die alex and another survivor clear rivers ali larter investigate the suspicious suicide of a friend and a mortician tony candyman todd clues them in to the truth alex interrupted death s design by saving people who should have died in the explosion and death will want to claim its rightful victims in order to save himself and the others alex will have to figure out death s new plan and thwart it of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the scream audience final destination is the best so far talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula we ve seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one by one by a faceless slasher but reddick cuts out the hockey masked middle man and makes the villain death itself first time feature director james wong made the most of that premise every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding reminding us that death is everywhere can come at anytime everyday objects and events vibrate with menace the most amusing harbinger of doom john denver s rocky mountain high which is played several times in the movie before someone dies the link is that denver died in a plane crash and the song includes a line about fire in the sky the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror devon sawa who previously starred in another horror flick idle hands gives a frantic and convincing lead performance kerr smith is carter hogan an antagonist of alex s whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence seann william scott who s also in theaters right now in road trip plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter tony todd s one scene cameo is delicious but all too brief bottom line watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between but this destination is worth visiting 
every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget and forgive its glaring imperfections such is the case with good will hunting a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life despite some serious character problems this is still a very good film you probably know about the plot so i ll make it quick will hunting damon is a janitor at m i t he s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it he likes to go out with his friend chuckie affleck and their other working class buddies and drink beer he s good looking charismatic and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk after getting into a tiff with the law a distinguished professor skarsg rd discovers will s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time at a price he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems that have stumped the academic elite with the professor after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once promising therapist named sean maguire williams who has his own problems in the meantime will meets a british medical school student driver and they begin to fall in love the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film even though we ve seen movies about misunderstood erratic prodigies before shine ring a bell the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn t just focus solely on one character alas though this is not a perfect film as much as you feel like it could ve been while watching it the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent of course is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep human relationships usually yes but is it possible for him to also be so handsome funny quick with the tongue and city street tough not very likely come on usually these guys are total nerds who can t even buy their own shirts much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med school girls will is just a little too perfect and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition the heavy handed anti war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish overlong pompous and completely unnecessary all this sounds pretty bad but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways damon s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable his performance is truly extraordinary which leads me to the really good part of the review the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word acting i can t recall seeing a film recently that was so well acted from top to bottom from minnie driver s frustrated lover to ben affleck s laid back best friend and all the small roles in between the performances are magnificent robin williams skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line the real gem though is stellan skarsg rd s turn as professor lambeau an award winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger smarter will hunting the scenes between williams and skarsg rd as two old college pals who ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid display some of the best acting i ve ever seen when i say delivering the goods this is what i m talking about watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about gus van sant s to die for drugstore cowboy cold urban direction is right on as well as danny elfman s sauntering musical score i highly recommend good will hunting despite its faults it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year 
armageddon in itself symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking stories have been replaced with special effects character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up armageddon is as stupid as loud and as shallow as any movie you ll see come out this summer or maybe even any other summer but i loved every freaking minute of it believe me i m just as shocked as you are hell i don t even know why i went to see it in the first place the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year or at least in the running i m sorry but somebody dial isn t quite the tagging that s going to sell a movie it isn t too wise either to market the film using the movie s stupidest lines beam me up scotty yeah that sure is great writing i mean let s face it armageddon s previews rival the truman show s as being some of the worst of the year neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice of course you all know the story when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas nasa calls in the us s top oil drillers to go into space and implant a nuclear device eight hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid in the coarse of all this mayhem we are introduced to some interesting and not so interesting characters belonging to the former group is rockhound steve buscemi a horny little womanizing genius who s always full of wisecracks even when flying into space at a huge amount of g s also there s the always cool as hell billy bob thornton as dan truman the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo only without the intensity and great lines to deliver then on the flip side of the coin is the tired contrived character of harry stamper bruce willis who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can t quite place the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie basically that s about it as i said this is hardly a film about plot it s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden case in point nasa doesn t know that there is even an asteroid on it s way until eighteen days before impact huh another example at one point in the movie two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy how pretentious is that want another one okay before the oil drillers blast off into space one of them starts singing leaving on a jet plane and soon all the rest join in did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture but naturally all this sappiness melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin time at the movies and don t get me wrong despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon i still very much enjoyed it so even if you don t win one of mcdonald s free tickets it s still definitely worth checking out 
 you ll go ape over tarzan because it s more fun than a barrel of monkeys okay there s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie disney s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship father mother and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson it s amazing the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack before you know it an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala glenn close a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard against the wishes of her mate and family leader kerchak lance henricksen she takes on the infant boy as her own tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild much of tarzan s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his father which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well meant his attempts all he s looking for is acceptance perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers but one which will ring true with a lot of adults when you really think about it this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end look back on past disney animated features and you ll see the trend growing up tarzan voiced by alex d linz as a child and by tony goldwyn as an adult has a couple of friends one is an ape named terk rosie o donnell and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor wayne knight both provide the requisite comic relief timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold i m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films just fill in the blanks can you see it now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it we ve already had a fish and a crab and we ve had a candle and a teapot a genie and a dog a few stone statues have we had an ape and an elephant yet well there we go of course there s gotta be romance somewhere along the line so jane minnie driver gets introduced about halfway through together with her father dr porter nigel hawthorne and the big game hunter clayton brian blessed jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory you tarzan me jane scene thankfully those aren t the exact words however i found it distracting that tarzan is going ohh ohh ee ee one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction how does he tell his name to another ape ohh ohh ee tarzan ee ee ohh well regardless of my picky nature the romance actually works as only disney romance can purely contrived but for some reason rather believable but hey tarzan s a young adult do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane isn t that illegal in most countries oh well i don t think disney will be using my quote anymore tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical there s lots of music to be sure but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time we instead get more of a phil collins concert as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material this isn t really a bad thing as the songs are very high energy and catchy i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day it s just different do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie with each new feature disney animation gets even better not necessarily by leaps and bounds but since they put out a new film each year a steady rate of improvement is apparent and this definitely shows in tarzan there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near d effect and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers and had me thinking this isn t just tarzan it s extreme tarzan however tarzan does not seem to have what i call its chandelier scene which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort utilizing a computer assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking lasting but a few seconds at most it s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail as usual the voice talent is up to snuff convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters the one poor choice in casting however was rosie o donnell going into the film i didn t know she was even a part of it but when terk started talking i recognized her voice immediately her performance was fine but through the rest of the film i kept thinking that s no boy ape that rosie o donnell distracting to say the least i ll admit i ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story tarzan of the apes so i couldn t tell you how true this film stays to the book but unless you re a purist you should have few objections to this film with solid performances action adventure a bit of romance and great music and animation tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us note when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature this time i ll just say that i went to mcdonald s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry and tarzan was on the cup nuff said 
i was born in which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons tracks and disco however since i was years old i ve seen more than my share of adult films i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i m not against pornogrpahy i ve seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available director paul thomas anderson s boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema the mid to late s this was the period when x rated movies were real movies shot on film shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films films that attempted to tell a real story one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how like in an any other billion dollar industry the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete in this case the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette burt reynold s manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur known as jack horner horner s has a steady family of performers some of whom live in his plush l a home but in the world of porn performers are a commodity the fresher the better when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque he decides to add him to his stable it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his as directed by anderson the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l a s hardcore film scene but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut by the film s final image what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams boogie nights is not about sex it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers in fact the film isn t really about pornography at all pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub culture to find acceptance of who they are the film goes to brilliant often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world yet like in the lauded tarantino films these people still have their own moral code their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion first stop the den mother julianne moore in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son second stop the cuckold crewman william h macy who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real life porn star nina hartley but the driving force behind the plot is year old eddie adams eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it with no real ambition of his own he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame his alcoholic mother clearly dissatisfied with her own lot abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house horner introduces him to amber waves moore who immediately adopts him a nuclear family is born the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her babies provides some of the films most poignant scenes clearly she is not even fit to manage her own life let alone nurture these lost children but the need to love and be loved is so strong they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family then again perhaps its not so different from real families at all eddie adams who later takes on the screen name dirk diggler is skillfully acted by former pop star mark wahlberg i say former pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job this is bold and brave territory for such a young man he pulls it off marvelously wahlberg is a big bright star with a big bright future boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt without the first amendment preachiness its intimate studies of character make it the superior film wahlberg s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson s but in my opinion boogie nights is not the best film of the year i got the feeling that itus hour running time could have been cut by or minutes without losing any of its resonance still if the subject matter of this film intimidates you thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway ya know kinda like disco 
dreamworks pictures presents a jinks cohen company production kevin spacey annette bening american beauty thora birch allison janney peter gallagher mena suvari wes bentley and chris cooper co producers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l hall a s c produced by bruce cohen dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes both my wife and daughter think i m this gigantic loser and they re right i have lost something i didn t always feel this sedated with that piece of dialogue we are fully introduced to lester burnham kevin spacey a year old man trapped within his own life lester works for an advertising agency his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid life crisis he is suffering estranged from both his wife and his daughter lester starts to crack under the stress his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies and sullen apathy carolyn burnham annette bening is the prototypical career woman homemaker she carefully tends her rose garden decorates her home with the best furnishings but inside she is desperate unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family the third member of this anti family is jane burnham thora birch lester and carolyn s daughter a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction this funny and frightening slice of life is refreshingly simple not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters most notably is barbara fitts allison janney the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts she has almost no dialogue and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one colonel fitts chris cooper is an angry and frightened man his rage directed almost singularly at his son ricky wes bentley who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham s in fact they are the next door neighbors anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in american beauty alan ball who was the co executive producer of the hit tv series cybil and creator of the new sitcom oh grow up has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years not one character in this film rings falsely and the depth of personality in each is achingly honest and insightful the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as the graduate or lolita kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become lester tries to return to his youth he quits his job actually blackmailing his employer for one year s salary starts smoking pot fantasizes about his daughter s girlfriend angela mena suvari in a marvelous performance here starts working out and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet mr spacey s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous that we can be certain that come oscar time we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy unable to cope with her growing disillusionment she forces herself to maintain her demeanor driving her further and further into desperation adultery and possibly murder ms bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning she is the prototypical trophy child when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team i m so proud of you honey you didn t screw up once the bitterness and resentment are palpable thora birch is a young actress to watch praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance colonel finn is a man in complete denial his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma the boy next door who may be more foe than friend a deceitful and calculating young man whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him mr bentley s performance is the one troublesome note in the film that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar that one almost faults the performance for it director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle scenes of carolyn walking through the rain carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful capturing the season in all of it s harsh beauty fall has never looked so inviting yet depressing every nuance of american beauty begs it s audience to think and examine it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come and well it should as it is simply one of this years best

when people are talking about good old times they actually want to make some bad times look better nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the s for new generations superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids for people who actually had to live in that period it was the gloomy decade marked by lost ideals of rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era martin scorsese s taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies is most celebrated of them all the movie s protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can t sleep at nights the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world the only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantine s presidential campaign their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre losing his only link to better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris jodie foster year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi as many great movies that got cult status through the years taxi driver became the object of many interpretations for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial cities the story could have been set in th century same as in our times for others the movie uses raskolnikov like figure in order to portray burning problems of s america its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today many of us share his feelings of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drugs prostitution and senseless street violence his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstances like with secret service agents pimps or job interviewers make him a person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain however most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person wants but doesn t have a stomach lack of brains to do it while de niro s travis might come in and out of particular times and places other persons that appear in the film mostly played by the character actors give it distinctively s feel wizzard played by peter boyle presents the only link with america s better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he knows stuff his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade other characters on the other hand show the bad side of new age matthew sport keitel who befriended real life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime is dressed like a hippie iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture porno movies that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy even the politicians like senator palantine are lost in post vietnam and post watergate mess his broad and senseless messages that cover the lack of any serious program can t fool even such idiots like travis the past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism can t be washed away even by ironic happy end travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader s screenplay into the silver screen new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was same as his protagonist famous for the wrong reason instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits for many years it was tabloid fodder because of hinckley and his real life re enactment of events in the movie now more than two decades later when some other life imitating art incidents get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory 
it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste indeed while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee jumping they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool this movie creeps up on you at a slow minutes i mean creeps and despite the final shot s ambiguity i left completely satisfied henry fool used to have an e arrives at garbageman simon grim s house claims the vacant basement apartment and almost instantly inspires simon urbaniak to take up writing henry martin donovan look alike ryan is an ex convict a once great author who has been exiled and marginalized by the publishing community because of his criminal activity simon s poetry turns him into a local sensation as it causes mute women to sing high school girls to swoon and councilmen to rile against its pornographic content meanwhile henry seduces both simon s dependent mother porter and immature sister sundance queen posey with philosophical babble which is by turns brilliant and inane and breathy animal lust these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable the teacher student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself henry fool is sprinkled with hartley ian flourishes simon drinks milk from udderley s the big teen hang out is called world of donuts simon wears his garbageman s uniform throughout the editing style is decidedly elliptical which is key to the conclusion s said ambiguity the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first self consciously quirky the introductory scenes are a chore these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion a belief in themselves and because they have long term goals henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner but they aren t pop slackers the story is rather classical the tutor is a better talker than a doer raised on books the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of shades of film school the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small and the final third does test one s patience yet henry fool is tight hardly excessive in its length how refreshing to see a movie this long in devoted entirely to character and unless i nodded off not a single building exploded this hartley s seventh feature is contemplative about the artist fortunately we never get a sampling of simon s work and it s a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers pens 
the thought provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of leila a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty year career to gain u s distribution thanks to first run features although unfamiliar with mehrjui s previous directing efforts perhaps the reason for this is that while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers set in modern day iran leila begins on the birthday of the title character leila hatami after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband reza ali mosaffa as leila and reza set off to visit his parents and then hers where a birthday celebration has been planned things seem rosy for the couple on the outside but for leila life isn t quite as sweet earlier on that very same day leila had gone to see her physician and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child when all of the conditions are ruled out and leila passes up the possibility of adoption reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her and doesn t care at all about having children nonetheless leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby which is the societal norm and her self esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother in law jamileh sheikhi whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news reza is her only son bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with leila hesitantly agrees and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn t give her full blessing there are no easy answers to be found within leila a film that thoughtfully examines the central character s unfortunate plight as well as the inner workings of leila herself told through matter of fact narration almost completely taken over by her own shame she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother in law s requests even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman maybe because leila is from iran the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence leila however is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy no matter what the circumstances one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza who married only three months after their first meeting but obviously love each other very deeply it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible although seemingly unimportant at first glance an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing nearly uncontrollably actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her these small moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn outraging sequences in the latter half in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage foolishly unbeknownst to reza leila prays each time that the date will not go well so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer refusing to stay over at her parent s house the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below despite her initial agreement to such a thing leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him sure the whole second marriage was his mother s idea but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children then he could have still easily backed out couldn t he in the pivotal role of leila who appears in every scene leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength unavoidable vulnerability and utter despair unlike most american films in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa as reza a man who i believe does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else for all of its strong aspects leila isn t a perfect film on a technical level i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed and concerning the plot developments the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before mehrjui s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother in law played memorably by jamileh sheikhi despite these minor missteps leila is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may release at new york s cinema village and then on may in la the thought provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales and when the climax arrives leila s self worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation to which there is no return it s difficult to not consider how leila s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme was going through 
a miracle of filmmaking some like it hot is a brilliant film and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists it is the pinnacle of writer director billy wilder s career a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make jerry lemmon and joe curtis are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig trying to earn enough money to feed themselves one night as they re playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy the place is raided as it turns out the owner spats columbo george raft was ratted out by toothpick charlie george e stone several weeks later on valentine s day jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage eager to escape the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid the only catch its a girls band so josephine curtis and daphne lemmon make their way onto the train and go to florida on the way there they meet sugar kane monroe a bombshell singer who is looking for love jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer but there s two problems they re in drag and millionaire osgood fielding joe e brown falls madly in love with daphne what follows in pure hysteria still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the italian opera lovers festival tony curtis is hysterical as joe josephine especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar marilyn monroe in a wonderfully comic performance is sugar providing incredible timing and sex appeal along with true sincerity the scenes however are all stolen by either brown or lemmon lemmon is hysterical as daphne cast as the less rational one lemmon s performance is ridiculously crazy it is disorder in the style all billy wilder s brown is particularly hilarious as osgood as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony he manages to use lemmon s ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire every set piece is flawless as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture wilder s script is stunning as he carefully combines gangsters cross dressing romance sex music gender roles and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria so pitch perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece the final line of this absolutely incredible film wilder s is dead wrong when he says nobody s perfect billy wilder is especially when he makes something this disastrously funny nobody s perfect but billy wilder 
the central focus of michael winterbottom s welcome to sarajevo is sarajevo itself the city under siege and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents platoon racial tumultuosness the risible the walking dead or a tinge of schmaltziness schindler s list the two leads stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with are extremely believable not one moment with them involved rings false the question is not what went right the question is what went wrong for one the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs and that s about it the assortment of high profile supporting actors ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter into liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters albeit they strive the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison still winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy frantic editing and imaginative use of music and it s a plus because he doesn t toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness he wants us to know that in war no one is victorious the sweet hereafter starring ian holm sarah polley bruce greenwood tom mccamus gabrielle rose arsinee khanjian alberta watson maury chaykin caerthan banks produced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg script by atom egoyan based on the novel by russell banks directed by atom egoyan running time mins rated r atom egoyan s powerfully meditative the sweet hereafter is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i ve seen this year it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety with cold and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected ian holm as the somber lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers he s a lion for the wrong reasons the pain for having lost his daughter she s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money is reflected on the town and in some mesmerizing flashbacks we witness how she lost her purity it s one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i ve ever seen but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly the peaceful benevolent girl who in contrast to the other characters remains the most mentally stable during past present or future her ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite yet near revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for breaking the waves both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see truly feel their wordless omnipotent love the sweet hereafter though is atom egoyan s movie and as of now he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema after surging to worldwide recognition with s exotica the sweet hereafter makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves an artist he interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common 
capsule side splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs most comedies these days have one flaw they re not funny they think they re funny but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem ruthless people for instance which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny this is one of the few movies i ve seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through instead of a couple of set pieces that inspired a laugh think of the dismal fatal instinct the whole movie works like clockwork jim carrey playes a high powered lawyer to whom lying is as natural as breathing there is one thing he takes seriously though his son and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away but his wife is divorced and seeing another man and now it looks like they may move away together the son goes with them of course the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey s over the top persona with reality then the plot springs into action after being snubbed not deliberately by his father at his birthday the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles that for just one day dad can t lie he gets the wish what happens next is sidesplitting everything turns into a confrontation when cornered by a bum for some change he shouts no i m not giving you any money because i know you ll spend it on booze all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society he can t even get into an elevator without earning a black eye and what s worse he s now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture carrey who i used to find unfunny has gotten better at his schtick even if it s a limited one he uses it to great effect in this movie there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process there s a grin breaking out across my face right now just remembering the scene he can t even write the lie his fingers twitch his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning and when he tries to talk it s like he s speaking in tongues equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp don t ask why tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom it fails with semi predictable results and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end a shame too because the movie insists on having a big ridiculous climax that involves carrey s character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs then breaking his leg etc a simple reconciliation would do the trick why is this stupid pent up climax always obligatory it s not even part of the movie s real agenda thankfully liar liar survives it and so does carrey maybe they were being merciful on reflection if i d laughed any more i might have needed an iron lung 
with more and more television shows having gay characters and even the infamous ellen sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines the birdcage was critically acclaimed as was this years chasing amy then along came in out and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released it s also noticeable that this alternative lifestyle becomes less and less taboo as the years go by and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort while it s a very serious issue to many it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety but the way we re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh at it is more and more becoming something we laugh with and when a movie like in out comes along it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy it doesn t poke fun at the lifestyle it simply uses it to all it s comedic capacity just as love sex marriage birth death and anything else has been the idea for in out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids afflicted gay man in philadelphia if you remember during his acceptance speech hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life it s a serious and touchy subject but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick it s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual it may have been more controversial but because it was written by an openly gay writer the prerogative was set kevin kline who only seems to become more and more acclaimed stars as howard brackett a high school english teacher in the small picturesque town of greenleaf indiana after a three year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery joan cusack a wedding date has been set and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story greenleaf high graduate cameron drake matt dillon is up for a best actor oscar the small town eagerly awaits both events and both seem quite astronomical but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other when cameron drake is announced the winner the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher mr brackett everyone is cheering back in greenleaf that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words and he s gay the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop the thing is nobody including howard can understand how cameron came to that conclusion and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf naturally the questions pour from howard s fiancee parents debbie reynolds wilford brimley students and the high school s principal tom halliwell bob newhart and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious howard is clean neat honest sincere a romantic and perhaps the most incriminating fact he loves barbara streisand the frenzy isn t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and entertainment tonight wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning one particular reporter is peter malloy tom selleck of inside entertainment who unlike the collage of other reporters wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett including coverage of his wedding the intrusion is all but welcome by howard who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute it seems that no matter where he turns a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees the dominoes begin to tumble as howard s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay it all sounds very devastating and it would be if it weren t presented with near perfection by one of this year s most delightful ensemble casts kline seems only to improve with age and he is downright perfect here the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine and they use it wonderfully every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever dillon has never been so likeable cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role and brimley reynolds and newhart all provide huge laughs when they re up to bat rudnick s script is heavily laced with wit and humor and you ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes while in out doesn t carry enough to give it four stars it remains one of the best done films of the year all around the script is exuberant the actors are absolutely top notch and we re allowed just the perfect blend of heart tugging so as not to bog down the laughs it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety yet we re still allowed a sappily touching ending despite it s subject matter and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex this is a movie that everyone could and should enjoy frank oz best known as a voice talent for muppets directs this film quite delightfully using all the potential rudnick s script has to offer which turns out to be quite a bit check this one out you ll have a gay old time 
before you read my review you gotta know that i love woody allen this is a very important note because allen s films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius while others see him as a dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again i love most of his films but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the s in fact why he felt the need to make movies in those years is beyond me if you look at the quality of those films you ll hear what i m saying the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives in fact i secretly hoped that he would take some time off at the turn of the millennium just to re energize or something but it doesn t appear as though he has any intention of doing that so here i am again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old plot the year is and woody allen is a top notch insurance investigator his methods are very old fashioned and apparently out of date a new employee hunt has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency the two do not like each other one night they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician and unbeknownst to them placed under his control soon thereafter jewels are stolen words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer critique a wonderful recreation of the s style movies with the fast talking witty banter between co workers a catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements such as the veronica lake type sexpot one liners galore and a fluffy if inconsequential plotline on the downside the film actually starts off pretty slowly with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy the sets on the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man but it wasn t not long before i was fully engaged by the characters entertained by the many zingers delivered back and forth between allen and hunt and actually interested in the resolution of the flick i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old parody and actual reinvention note theron s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool of course films like this with little or no real tension in the plot need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick fire dialogue and once again allen does a great job in playing his character who for once isn t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude he actually plays a macho guy here and handles it pretty well especially the scenes in which he s hypnotized but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt an actress who i was openly sick of seeing in movies late last year sorry babe you were just in too many at the same time anyway she s really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men and doesn t miss a beat of allen s fast paced dialogue i didn t care much for her running joke about him dying whenever he left a room but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did yum yum harumph but i digress so let s recap a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score some funny one liners especially in the second half a decent plotline although you shouldn t expect a real mystery or anything and some solid acting all around i can t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen s best work but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through it s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute old school kind of vibe with chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion little known facts about this film and its stars annie hall celebrity everyone says i love you husbands and wives mighty aphrodite small time crooks when harry met sally you ve got mail 
if you want some hearty laughs then rat race is the movie for you this unpretentious little comedy which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype will have you bouncing in your theater seat and while the film fits neatly into the low brow slapstick school of comedy one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean spiritedness the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner john cleese who must race from vegas to a bus station locker miles away in silver city n m inside the locker is a duffel bag containing million the first one to open the locker gets the bag and the money what the group of participants doesn t know is that cleese s donald sinclair i can do anything i want i m eccentric is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel the participants include vera whoopi goldberg and merrill lanai chapman a newly reunited mother and daughter disgraced pro football referee owen templeton cuba gooding jr italian tourist mr pollini rowan atkinson randy pear jon lovitz and his family the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody seth green and vince vieluf and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer breckin meyer various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another the most side splitting situations involve vera and merrill s encounter with the squirrel lady a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates owen s commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look alikes on their way to a lucy convention the cody brothers misadventures with a hot air balloon a flying cow and a monster truck and the pear family s stopover at a barbie museum which turns out not to be what they think it is the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman s script builds the laughs without going into detail this bit segues from the museum to hitler s touring car to eva braun s dark lipstick to lovitz burning his tongue culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans rat race s cast is first rate cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap lovitz is at first a bit whiny but his character grows on you gooding is having a fine romp and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese s deadpan assistant a man born without a personality the film is directed by jerry zucker who knows something about comedy along with his brother david and friend jim abrahams he was responsible for such hits as airplane and ruthless people a throwaway subplot which is good for some laughs features cleese and his buddies betting on a series of outlandish situations including one dealing with a hooker and pepto bismol this is a fun little feature the only letdown comes at the finale which is too touchy feely and sweet almost negating what came before it rat race is a summer sleeper but it will keep you awake as will the laughter of those watching around you 
according to hollywood movies made in last few decades life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark god forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience on the other hand it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view this film is amarcord comedy by famous italian director federico fellini which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense instead we follow one year in s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs as well as series of local often very colourful characters although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist year old boy titta played by bruno zanin and chronicles his sexual frustrations obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca played by magali noel problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family as well as troubles his father played by armando brancia have with mussolini s fascist regime amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film and it probably explains why it is very popular even among those people who actually don t like federico fellini s work very much every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film word amarcord is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase i remember in local italian dialect in the same way the word is distorted so is the past in memories of those who remember it after the premiere fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film but it doesn t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini s childhood or not any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film fellini s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images characters look like caricatures actors playing them often deliberately overact and women especially those who fuel titta s sexual fantasies often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions every now and then scenes that depict s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters visions because of that almost everything in this film looks different and in most cases better than it would have looked in the real life even the fascism gets fellinian make over fellini views mussolini s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history and opportunity for comedy when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour unlike many of his italian colleagues in s who had used s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda fellini doesn t care that much about politics lack of self righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini s humanistic approach to his characters each of them regardless of age gender social class or physical appearance is given opportunity to express his or her views dreams and fears fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people because of this warmth and democratic spirit amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of th century and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable melancholic and even tragic moments fellini couldn t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie vignettes aren t memorable because of the characters only fellini uses camera painting film in bright colours especially in the scenes that depict character s fantasies fellini also knows how to use locations whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel bright coloured beach or rural countryside even the down to earth streets of rimini where everyone knows everyone gets magical dimension during the snowfall on the other hand lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini s long time associate nino rota his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art 
i ve noticed something lately that i ve never thought of before pseudo substance hollywood faking deep meanings in their films have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there was something missing more and more filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff i m not trying to say city of angels is that bad it had a lot going for it but somewhere along the way it faltered somehow underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography the predictable ending that shattered our hopes even though we saw it coming only added to the disappointment but for over an hour city of angels is well worth the time nicolas cage is seth a guardian angel who like hundreds likely thousands or even millions of other angels spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life meg ryan in her most subdued performance yet plays maggie a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive after losing a patient on the surgery table these questions envelope maggie and seth the angel who was there to oversee the patient s transition into the afterlife is immediately captivated by the doctor he begins following and observing maggie falling more and more in love with her everyday angels who we quickly learn are not and never were humans can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire seth s adoration is too much to resist and eventually he does appear to maggie quite regularly although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community the angels are interestingly presented all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities but it s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness cage is a wonderfully versatile actor think face off raising arizona and it could happen to you what a combo who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once it s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire the two aren t very comparable to each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy roles and it s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy but even though the two leads do an impressive job it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye it s a shame that with so much going for it city of angels falters so much in its final stages leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there they just didn t know quite how to get to it they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey to others thru word of mouth so after telling us for minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths based on the german film wings of desire that being the english title of course city of angels is ninety percent success enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings even the devastatingly disappointing ending most movie goers the non cynics anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized nonetheless city of angels is beautifully captivating which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories 
director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days terry gilliam comes to mind as another one film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential the film almost automatically deserves a good review and when they add a fascinating story to it you have nearly perfect entertainment fincher s the game is no exception to this the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time fincher hasn t made a film since seven his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever so it is about time he made another film and what a ride it is the game isn t quite as powerful as seven but in some ways it is better overall the game could have used a little more clarity or a little more uncertainty it walks a line of insanity and reality but it never goes either way until the very end the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight unfortunately unlike the usual suspects we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening whether it be true or false however this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent the game is told completely from its main character s point of view nicholas van orton michael douglas is a high strung and isolated businessman he lives alone in his giant mansion divorced from his wife elizabeth and is celebrating his th birthday the same age at which his father committed suicide at in the same mansion for his th birthday conrad sean penn the rebel of the family gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs consumer recreation services it will make your life fun again his brother promises as skeptical as nicholas is he is somewhat intrigued and annoyed by the lack of information something this businessman hates seeing a billboard in an office he decides to visit the mysterious company jim feingold james rebhorn greets nicholas and guides him through the sign up process which consists of psych tests physicals emotional responses and other mind games each game is suited to each person s emotional and psychological needs explains feingold one day nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company what he doesn t realize is that the game has already begun the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas way how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive the detail involved in fincher s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them with seven fincher had almost every single shot mean something he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to compared to seven though the game is light and comical because of this film s sense of humor and self awareness nothing can be taken quite seriously so don t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game because it doesn t want you to what does make sense is the final revelation when everything becomes apparent and clear if taken as it is the game s ending makes complete sense but if you try and critique every minute detail then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility perhaps that is the reason i docked the film while trying to remain realistic and plausible the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen we don t really care if douglas character lives or not because it isn t believable the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas douglas has played lonely businessmen before but here he adds another level to his performance his character who is normally level headed and relies on facts is forced to trust nobody can he believe the waitress he bumped into what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well and gives one of his best performances even better than his falling down persona the supporting cast is essential in this film and casting was critical sean penn is always good and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas brother deborah kara unger from crash is the waitress he bumps into and her performance is extremely good in fact she almost steals the film from douglas james rebhorn portrays his character very well and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas predicament another good performance comes from armin mueller stahl from shine as the book editor but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game he not only commands this cast but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life the game is rated r for language violence some gore and some nudity and drugs what is essential for this film to work is the writing john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue and some very funny moments this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects did however the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year s best films 
warning anyone offended by blatant leering machismo had better avoid this film or lots of blood guts men against men and mano et mano stuff in other words it s a walter hill film with a john milius script i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm wrestling matches these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb and we got tough guys galore here drug running banditos by the dozens all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill tempered overall a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover up supposedly any connection between the government and the drug runners and lots of shit kicking texas dirt farmers who d as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you in particular we got nick nolte as one hard ass texas ranger powers boothe as the drug kingpin michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army and rip torn as the local sheriff torn is the sympathetic figure of the group he smiles before shooting anyone as to women well i ve never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film and at this rate i doubt i ever will women exist here to look good comfort the man and get argued over gosh just like the old days frankly this is a pretty good movie if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff the cinematography is excellent the cast of characters is broad and has texture the script is quite good and the film lets you keep up with what s happening yourself without spelling it out to you i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up finally there s lots of sam peckinpah slow motion shoot ups 
if this keeps up jane austen sense and sensibility pride and prejudice may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen mansfield park is a turn of the century th century going on th story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties ten year old fanny price hannah taylor gordon jakob the liar taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle sir thomas bertram harold pinter mojo spending her days reminded of her lower status she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful intelligent and engaging heroine quite unlike the original character which ms austen originally penned in her novel writer director patricia rozema when night is falling is responsible for the textual changes from a purely dramatic perspective the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film s audience appeal what ms rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms austen s own personality by including excerpts from the author s journals giving that dialogue to fanny the result is a central character that is immediately appealing as the grown fanny australian actress frances o connor all about adam does wonderfully textured work at times ms rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel s more introspective observations this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms o connor s credit that it works as well as it does the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund jonny lee miller plunkett macleane who appears fond of her as well his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford embeth davidtz bicentennial man enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry alessandro nivola inventing the abbotts who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film s appropriately austen like ending other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park the slave trade there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust fanny s cousin maria bertram victoria hamilton persuasion is an example of one making a poor match marrying a well to do fool who is able to make her comfortable but never happy fanny s own mother trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she married for love fanny given those two terrible examples and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean the spiritual answer of course lies in the middle of those two extremes marriage is not a cold calculating decision based upon self preservation neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace in the purest sense marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh matthew kjv love and logic can be combined god s word contains both so does a marriage based upon his truth

reflecting on bedazzled a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser one sinful thought remains in my mind if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley who portrays the fiery demon then use that pitchfork and point me the way with her pouty lips irresistible british accent and wild display of haute couture hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation it s practically impossible to turn this beelzu babe down her next target is elliot brendan fraser a tech support geek who is clumsy awkward and just too eager to please to aptly picture him you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring steve the copy guy who effortlessly irritated his co workers with his unpolished social skills eugene thus is loathed and feared by his co workers who do their best to stay out of his way yet beyond his annoying mannerisms he s a lovable oaf he wishes that he could get closer to allison frances o connor a co worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him however the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball s chance in hell dear god he prays i would give anything to have that girl in my life guess who then shows up she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul there s even an escape clause if elliot s wish doesn t go exactly the way he likes he need only beep her one guess as to what the three digit number is and he gets to start over the remainder of the film consists of elliot s various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth power fame and allison s love but when he makes sweeping statements such as i want to be very very powerful and very very rich and married to allison he ll soon learn that the devil is in the details for example and we ve seen this several times in the trailers he is granted his wish but finds out that he s a columbian drug lord and that allison while married to him has her eyes on someone else apparently the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short circuits his new life soon elliot wishes that he had never made that deal given the mischievous nature of the devil bedazzled has many amusing moments a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance he ably assumes various personas his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her hurley also heightens the humor quotient especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one it s clear that she s having a good time with it all yet while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story but that would be playing with fire what they ve got works so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is

like the great musical pieces of mozart himself amadeus is a true work of art it is one of those few movies of the s that will be known for its class its style and its intelligence why is this such a good film there are almost too many reasons to explain the story court composer salieri f murray abraham feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart tom hulce comes into his life as the young genius composer salieri feels envy and jealousy but at the same time is fascinated with mozart s brilliance and ingenious we travel through mozart s life as a composer through his struggles his triumphs and ultimately his demise the acting abraham is magnificient as salieri his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language this performance earned him a well deserved oscar tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart a quirky annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh he s strong but weak at the same time and must be aided by his wife elizabeth berridge who is good in her role but lacks dramatic depth jeffrey jones in a smaller more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world is cast perfectly because of his noble charm the movie every element of this movie works the costumes and makeup are very memorable as well as its stunning art direction and unforgettable scores adapted from mozart s original music while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come ad am i almost lost my nose and i like it i like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown 
vampire films as well as other horror films are usually dumb and predictable b movies meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning but has also a plot worth making movies about based on anne rice s novel interview with a vampire is a long dark trip to hell the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present day san francisco the camera slowly find particular window a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness so you want me to tell you the story of my life the mysterious man is louis brad pitt a two century old vampire telling his story to a fascinated interviewer christian slater his tale opens in louisiana just south of new orleans where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat tom cruise given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead louis chooses the latter a decision he will forever regret everlasting life and eternal youth promised to him by lestat turn instead into never ending suffering damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat but to sate his hunger he must feed and the blood of animals is not enough eventually he pierces the neck of a grief stricken young girl named claudia kirsten dunst whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis for a while they are one big happy family but all things end and claudia s growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation when luis and claudia break loose from lestat they travel to paris where the euro vamps santiago stephen rea and armand antonio banderas who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned director neil jordan the crying game together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere as the film begins there is an incredible palette of colors beautiful sunrises lush golden fields green forests inky blue clouds and blending sun when luis is born to darkness everything suddenly changes to dark velvet lit only by the silver moonlight the beautiful production design by dante ferretti wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re create the multiple historical periods in the film from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the th century to our present days the casting is likewise good involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood ireland and spain the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective cruise is energetic sinister charismatic wild and bloodthirsty cruise s lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance with alarming swiftness the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror as his murderous purpose becomes clear kill them mercifully but do it you are what you are for do not doubt you are a killer that is how lestat is teaching luis but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages brad pitt is equally convincing as the vampire with a human soul antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective but since they play more or less secondary characters their performances are almost invisible the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character the world is changing around the little child but she does not she remains unchangeable a child for all eternity only her wise dark eyes reveal her age ironically the film s only miss is the script anne rice s novel is a very interesting read and her script is rich colorful and emotional but it is also tiering and too melancholic at times resembling a soap opera claudia is that what i should do let you go my father my luis who made me who will look after me my dark angel when you are gone luis everything will be alright claudia do you really believe that and then they hug emotionally moments like those displayed above and luis self pity is a bit tiresome however rice s script is otherwise strong and well structured bringing up humor and comic episodes that were more or less hidden in the book when lestat finds claudia s dead dressmaker whom she has killed he cries out who will make you that dress now be a little practical never in the house moments like that are both entertaining and appealing neil jordan s direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity homosexuality love and loneliness his gothic saga is not meant to scare but to display these issues differently wrapped up in mystery his new original picture brings vampire films to a new height

there s an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy return of the jedi the final installment of the series is easily the most innovative action packed and entertaining of the three films the dark eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone instead for return of the jedi we have good triumphing decisively over evil a resolution to a love triangle and walking teddy bears even darth vader doesn t seem very intimidating this time around with the arrival of the emperor an apparition like creature played by ian mcdiarmid vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill princess leia carrie fisher lando calrissian billy dee williams chewbacca peter mayhew c p anthony daniels and r d kenny baker are on a rescue mission to luke s home planet of tatooine their goal to save han solo harrison ford from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt it is at jabba s home a creepy looking stone fortress guarded by hog nosed beasts that most of the added special effects come into play from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba s sand barge the effects are top notch as soon as han is freed from his cryo freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt it s back to outer space where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire s newest threat a second more powerful death star that if activated could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor so while the fleet prepares for the final battle luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks there they are befriended by the ewoks the teddy bear like native race and luke fearing that his presence is endangering the group turns himself over to vader return of the jedi has some interesting elements the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well acted from a technical point of view the space battles are amazing easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films not only are there many many more ships but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved on one level return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects in the special edition even more ships are added making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films by now or then mark hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher have all matured in their on screen personas the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific as in empire billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy cunning and evil creature although he s not as imposing as vader was in star wars although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment with the spectacular new special effects the adorable ewoks the sinister jabba the hutt the evil emperor the same old millenium falcon darth vader s incredible betrayal the destruction of the new death star and the always lovable yoda return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang congratulations to george lucas whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come 
notting hill s trailer is awful a laughless schmaltzy montage the movie was desperately marketed to the anti phantom menace crowd the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter and it apparently worked perhaps the presence of julia roberts whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me had a lot to do with notting hill s opening weekend success but the film s staying power is based on word of mouth allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill grant stars as william thacker a travel bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott roberts a common thief some spilled orange juice and some stilted conversation leads to their first highly impetuous or is that improbable kiss days later william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist and so begins a passionate albeit surreptitious affair aside notting hill s portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate only anna s celebrity or william s lack thereof threatens to drive a wedge between them richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered and for at least its first half hour the picture s beauty and the beast like scenario is romantic escapism of the highest order as with groundhog day or pleasantville while watching the high concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him herself in the lead it s william s ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna curtis who previously penned four weddings and a funeral is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple s situation is not enough to fuel two hours worth of entertainment so some of notting hill s finest moments revolve around william s eccentric friends and family by now dear reader you ve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans performance as william s imbecilic welsh flatmate yes he s a crowd pleaser a walking sight gag but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair bound and appropriately named bella mckee the anguished waitress of naked or max tom mcinnerny her lousy chef of a husband in the movie s best sequence william anna and company sit around bloated from max s latest concoction and hold a contest the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life the scene ends only as a british writer would end it if anything fantastic bits like these dull the main plot s dramatic impact roberts and grant especially are appealing but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times four weddings suffered similar flaws and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common they re lonely worth noting in roberts and grant s favour the ubiquitous i m just a girl standing across from a boy asking him to love her episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable on the visual side of things i especially appreciated michell s playful changing of the seasons number if only and this is a surprisinly minor gripe he had lopped off the egregious epilogue for a story that thrives on what we bring to it the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up leaving our imaginations in the lurch 
in october of audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer the film went on to gross over million dollars in the u s and even developed a cult following much like the previous year s million dollar grossing scream when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend it looked like a wonderful follow up did it live up to the first film the answer is no jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before she has been so upset since the incident nightmares haunt her all over the place but she has to move on she know attends college and is best friends with a funny outgoing girl named karla brandy who is trying to hook julie up with will benson played by newcomer matthew settle karla s boyfriend is tyrell the funny outgoing type who is played by soul food s mekhi phifer freddie prinze jr also returns as ray julie s boyfriend from a year ago one morning julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil of course they answer it correctly and they are off to the bahamas julie wants ray to come but he declines the offer so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie after they arrive at their hotel it is just them and the staff on the island it starts off as the weekend of their dreams something just had to come to mess up the one care free weekend of julie s life though ben willis muse watson is back and he isn t letting anyone survive this time will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances brandy in particular was impressive considering this is her first feature film you could see that the characters were horrified and they would do anything possible to survive matthew settle and freddie prinze jr are a completely different story let s start with settle matthew is completely fake in this film you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth you could tell he was acting and its reasons like him that this one isn t as good as the first one he does do a good job towards the end but that doesn t clear up the scars he already left on the film freddie prinze jr is almost as bad as matthew settle was he is almost completely unbelievable and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place we don t see him as much as settle otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell but yet again the dialogue is out of place the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one it would have been a bit better the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel the sound is pretty good but still not as creepy as the first film s jennifer love hewitt s song how do i deal is also played for about thirty seconds i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film the first film was very suspenseful and it contained some very memorable scenes the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up and almost reached the same level as the first film before this part in the film there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares that is okay though because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes i think the reason this film wasn t as scary as the original was because in the first one the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident he made them suffer for what they did in the second film ben willis just kills anyone he feels like he doesn t stick with ray and julie who were the ones he is actually after he had to go after karla will and tyrell if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie ray helen and barry it could have been much better and it would have made a lot more sense the bottom line not a disappointment but a third in the series would be out of hand 
i think that any competent member of the human race who s ever seen a movie any movie could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer even though i try very hard to not predict films as i m watching them especially not romantic comedies the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds and sometimes minutes before i actually saw it happen on screen but i don t care not even a little my reasons for this are simple adam sandler is great drew barrymore is great the movie is so funny there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard i haven t laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers sandler plays robby hart a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music in the opening scenes he seems like a happy go lucky wedding singer at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual steve buscemi who decides that his brother s wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life up to that point was utter pointlessness a week later at his own wedding he is left standing at the altar by his ex fianc e linda angela featherstone with his life in complete disarray he meets julia barrymore a waitress she is engaged to glenn matthew glave and is to marry him in about three months julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans soon and predictably it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk and that robby and julia really love each other oh sure it s trite and if anyone making this film expected us to like feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer then they truly underestimated their audience what makes the story bearable aside from the terrific costumes and s music are the performances barrymore is simply adorable here i ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et not only is she pleasant to look at but her acting job here really is a good one and it doesn t hurt that the character is likable and adequately well written and the jerk played in full force by graves is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i ve ever seen naturally the true star here is sandler i think the guy is flat out hilarious he can say something that just isn t funny and his delivery makes me laugh his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can indeed hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler the wedding singer gives him a character that for the first time he actually has to fit into as far as i m concerned he succeeded and this film is testimony that he does in fact have some range in his talents and the movie is just so funny perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc e abandoned him this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air and while the film like all romantic comedies takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren t very important the film is predicable but who cares the characters are extremely likable the movie is ridiculously funny and the experience is simply enjoyable in addition to this i can t imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film in that order i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review i just want everyone to know that i laughed a lot 
the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas has made the film out to be a comedy and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one it s and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash outs among them journalist raoul duke johnny depp and his attorney dr gonzo benito del toro these two spend most of the film in a drug induced stupor having strange hallucinations trashing their hotel rooms and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas but gets lost in a blur of drugs beer and flying dust and ends up wandering around with no clue who won he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate to cover a drug enforcement conference fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs it doesn t even in the beginning while the pair s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first the humor here is still fairly dark director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye and even when we re laughing we re laughing at them rather than with them they spend most of their time paranoid angry or just plain befuddled which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen but it s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first hand all this aside i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one hour mark thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off kilter satire of drug culture thankfully the script delivers it before too long as duke in a rare moment of lucidity stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie riding the wave of something that seemed special and important now it s six years later and the wave has finally broken as he puts it materialistic culture is still alive and well and for most of this film right in his face in las vegas the american dream of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever the social protesters have lost and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment in many ways fear and loathing is gilliam s most reality based film all of his others with the exception of the fisher king have made use of some sort of fantasy or science fiction plot elements yet it is his off the wall masterpiece brazil to which this film bears the most visual resemblance the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks and similarly duke s world is composed of the artificial empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations unlike the protagonist of brazil however duke is not a particularly admirable figure and neither is gonzo during the latter half of the film their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress while duke though he doesn t seem to approve doesn t do anything to stop it either by the time this scene takes place they don t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner duke seems to realize at some level that he s become something he doesn t like but he s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places i think he and his co writers deserve more credit than that there s plenty of substance here particularly in the second half its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the s and the objects of their rebellion just aren t usually very pleasant unlike say brazil or the fisher king both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment fear and loathing in las vegas shows us someone who s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs in its own psychedelic whacked out way it s sad and regretful but i think it s also a bit of a kick in the pants a challenge to find an alternative between chemically induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas style materialism indeed duke himself admits at one point that he s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them i m not sure if he s any closer to accepting it by the end or not but i suspect the audience will get the idea 
curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy but its humour won t appeal to everyone to be specific let me give you an example do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny don t see curdled on the other hand if you found that sequence to be pretty funny you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at our film s heroine gabriela played by angela jones is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles luckily for her miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage her scrapbook is getting pretty big the killer s nickname in the press is the blue blood killer because he preys on older rich socialite women and he s played by william baldwin this is not a spoiler one particularly striking m o on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests she immediately quits her job and signs on with pfcs which stands for post forensic cleaning service no points for guessing what they do her workmates are confused by gabriela s fascination with murder to them it s just a day job there s a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk and what they would say gabriela s partner elena played by mel gorham is particularly perturbed by gabriela s wide eyed fascination and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer s latest scene they re the messiest you see unbeknownst to them the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer so he s also heading over there the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental quentin tarantino executive produced this film which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature length film there are other parallels the star of curdled is angela jones the top billing goes to william baldwin but really jones is the central character who s probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos the death obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film curdled jr jones is great in curdled she s wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character s innocence or likeability she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow it s a great performance reb braddock s direction is extremely sharp and clever toeing the line between black humour and bad taste the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing any more than that would be a spoiler the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing of course it s impossible to really take this stuff seriously but then again you re not really supposed to braddock knows the audience is in on the joke and makes it a fun little romp as a result the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film and it feels like it the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time and some parts just seem to drag while its running time is already a short minutes it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax it ll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well 
the caveman s valentine starring samuel l jackson ann magnuson aunjanue ellis tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green based on his novel directed by kasi lemmons for more film dvd and books about movie reviews plus annual coverage of the toronto international film festival visit film freak central http filmfreakcentral net now with search engine a strange mixture of shine basquiat angel heart and grant morrison dave mckean s graphic novel arkham asylum the caveman s valentine is a feverish tale of a homeless madman cum detective who on the morning of february th discovers a valentine just outside his new york cave one of ella fitzgerald s strange fruit stuck in the crotch of a tree a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building is responsible for the murder romulus samuel l jackson is put on the trail of an avant garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould david leppenraub colm feore his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation romulus was a brilliant julliard trained pianist prior to his psychosis romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police woman daughter aunjanue ellis that even though he s a nut that doesn t mean that he can t solve a high profile society murder every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas and every character the same the caveman s valentine is a concept so high concept that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment with romulus s caveman a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane s urban noir hero spawn with a long vanished wife tamara tunie acting as a spiritual guide the occasional social caste commentary the secret base in a cave a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters and a wickedly colourful arch enemy the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren t inscribed with gotham pd that being said the caveman s valentine can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when in fact the caveman s valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless again like mcfarlane s spawn while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts it is no small detail that our hero romulus is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life in legend without knowledge of his royal birth but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park in the romulus mythology signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures while in the film the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds but of the carrion itself whether or not romulus of the caveman s valentine will found a nation or in the case of novelist george dawes green upon whose novel his own screenplay is based a franchise the fact remains that the caveman s valentine is easily the most misunderstood film of thus far it along with m night shyamalan s unbreakable is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has since miller s seminal the dark knight returns redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics readers of sam keith s brilliant the maxx comic series or of mtv s short lived animated adaptation of the same are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne the failure of both the maxx tv show and of the caveman s valentine not forgetting the initial backlash against unbreakable suggests that the public may not be ready for america s surprising contributions to dark fantasy luxuriantly lit brashly saturated and comic panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent death in venice ca while inhabiting robin standefer s practical magic mesmerizing sets the caveman s valentine is an unremittingly gorgeous film kasi lemmons following up her brilliant debut eve s bayou which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys artists and suffering the caveman s valentine is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape clearly not for every taste when approached with the correct paradigm it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post modern audience with urine stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes the caveman s valentine is a fine and a courageous film crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot s rat s alley wasteland

for a movie about disco era excess comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late s and early s manhattan dance club think of it as a sort of boogie nights lite where that similarly structured and set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift leaves the kinkier details to your imagination it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter but it thankfully never resorts to preaching either in fact were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment would be about as feathery as the time period s popular female hairstyle studio was a haven for the rich famous and generally good looking before it closed its doors forever in inside anything went and we are told everything did the film s fictional main character is shane o shea ryan phillippe the jerky jock from i know what you did last summer a fresh faced year old who dreams of venturing beyond the club s velvet rope and coming face to face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines his wish comes true when studio owner steve rubell mike myers spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in and permits him passage but not before he doffs his hideous shirt of course once inside shane becomes seduced by the club s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs he has such a good time that he doesn t want to leave so he seeks employment as a busboy he quickly becomes friends with greg breckin meyer and anita salma hayek a married couple who work along side of him greg s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio bartender while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own after rubbing elbows among other things with a renowned socialite sela ward and gaining the personal interest of rubell shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of but fame doesn t come without a price s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players at a slim hour and a half the film is too short to take on such a multi character focus and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act alleged last minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction since sometimes feels like it s missing a scene here or there nowhere is this more apparent than in shane s relationship with soap opera actress julie black neve campbell a frequent studio patron whom he s long admired from afar the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special that works despite these limitations then is largely due to the competence and energy with which it s assembled sure it s shallow slick sanitized portrait of a bygone age and sure we ve seen the rags to riches story gazillions of times but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision the film boasts some fine comic creativity the pinnacle of which is disco dottie the wedding singer s ellen dow an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public but slides up to shane behind s closed doors and asks for a funky little treat the solid sexy cast smooths out if only while you re caught up in the film any rough spots belonging to their alter egos or the plot newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat he and campbell as fetching as ever look so good together it s a shame their subplot goes nowhere meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in clueless he was the stoner with the joker smile while hayek simply sizzles especially when leading a dance class with the mantra one two three attitude sherry stringfield unidentifiable under big s hair takes on her first big screen gig since she left er as rubell s accountant but she s criminally underused as the droopy eyed drug addled steve rubell myers is worth the price of admission alone when he s not playing the life of the party the ex saturday night live comedian strips away all of rubell s confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty unhappy life with exorbitance it s a moment worthy of pity when while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening he attempts to seduce one of his employees and while his performance is largely serious myers mixes the empathy with a delicate austin powers esque wink thus keeping consistent with s overall feel gaudy larger than life and satisfyingly ornamental not unlike a giant disco ball 
let s face it since waterworld floated by the summer movie season has grown very stale with no new eye candy for four weeks straight we ve had to sustain ourselves on the quasi nutritional value of cheatin husbands traveling chocolate salesmen and computer generated serial killers sigh thank god for desperado the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi director robert rodriguez s notorious debut stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name he s a man in black with revenge on his mind and an arsenal in his case the woman he loved was killed in the first film so he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers sort of a tex mex version of the punisher if you will there isn t much of an emotional core to desperado rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo and sergio leone and sam peckinpah some may wince at the body count at least graphic killings is a fair estimate but it s all played for laughs big broad hispanic laughs that for me recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films sick slick fun 
hilarious ultra low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers brian o halloran and jeff anderson they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self fulfillment the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get out but you could spend ten times the film s budget a reported and still not get dialogue half as good as this originally rated nc for language not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears killing zoe remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you re halfway to killing zoe writer director roger avary s slow moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in way over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers he s the safecracker who s blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go though intriguing on all fronts the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction which avary co wrote with quentin tarantino in english and french the road to wellville based on the novel by t coraghessan boyle the road to wellville doesn t go very far bowels bowels and more bowels are explored by dr john harvey kellogg a buck toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins who in the early s advocated abstinence vegetarianism and frequent defecation he also invented the cornflake really checking in to kellogg s battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda just two of the many well known faces in this failed comedy leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack michael lerner lara flynn boyle john neville and dana carvey the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing but the novelty quickly wears off as writer director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo doo into drama what he ends up with is something that i can t print here phew stargate lawrence of arabia meets star wars this epic sci fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else director roland emmerich universal solider shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on the film is overlong the characters are cardboard and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci fi history that said there s still plenty to watch here sci fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands the morphing headdresses and a surprisingly spunky james spader he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that somebody else built the pyramids less interesting are co stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame star trek generations trek fans may be more forgiving but for the rest of us the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best the story is interesting but each scene goes too long the cast is earnest but the direction lacks punch and so on the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii original enterprise captain james t kirk appears on both ends of the story though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead get a life remarkably unremarkable miracle on th street in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al maybe a remake of miracle on th street is necessary john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the original the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn t work too well but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle his chemistry with children can moisten any eye no claus for alarm junior arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sure billy crystal did it before in rabbit test but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie what should be nothing more than a one joke premise actually gets better as it goes along director ivan reitman dave twins wisely keeps the farce to a minimum so the first hour moves slower than you might expect don t expect too many yuks from danny devito but you can t beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie how s that for a collision of acting styles 
the characters in palmetto collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie and it s just the right way to capture the film s ripe atmosphere of sensuality tension and even farce this humid florida set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke as far as set up is concerned the movie is nothing we haven t seen before but be patient palmetto spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don t see coming it s not a classic by any means but it sure is quite an engaging surprise harry barber woody harrelson is fresh out of prison where he s served a couple of years for a crime he didn t commit even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials harry s first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina gina gershon while searching for work he catches the eye of rhea malroux elisabeth shue the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire rhea proposes a scheme that ll get harry easy to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny you do like risks don t you mr barber rhea alluringly coos boys form a line behind me part of palmetto s success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue who demonstrates here that her oscar nominated turn in leaving las vegas might merely be foreshadowing great things to come shue s a seductive campy delight and pulls off a barbara stanwyck gloria swanson combo with admirable relish the other actors form a solid ensemble around her including sevigny kids tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease as well as the ever likeable gershon cast a far cry from her extreme roles in bound and showgirls harrelson is still doing fine follow up work to the people vs larry flynt palmetto does have its share of grievances harrelson s narration is needless i suppose and gershon s nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is one of the plot s unexpected angles that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which he s involved could have been played a little better there are moments when you question the tone but it s never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it s been receiving from most other critics if palmetto didn t want to be laughed at would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a live action who framed roger rabbit although a few elements can be questioned the movie works well on its own terms thanks to a juicy cast especially shue and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff you remember him from last summer s suddenly re popular the tin drum right everything runs smoothly and for fans of revelation heavy endings this film s got a few shocks in store that i won t even dream of revealing palmetto is a generous amount of fun to watch and that s all you need to know 
it s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters but it s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually shock cared for the characters not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles flaws and strengths to emerge so radiantly i d saw that it s been at least a couple decades even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers though i m hardly comparing a simple plan to say rear window or strangers on a train yet it s almost as good it s simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead of moving from plot point to plot point and merely laying out they might be caught overtones it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral elegantly directed by sam raimi yes the same a simple plan concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dim witted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe without anyone around and the possibility that no one would come looking for it the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep it but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking and so they generally don t flaunt anything they don t want to flaunt they ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse a they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities b they could try to fight off the rightful owners who are either villainous or just or c they could fight amongst themselves a simple plan though borrows a little from each of these a little tiff with the cops here a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent a chilling gary cole there and a bit of inside feuding over here but as austin powers would say that s not necessarily its bag baby what i most admired about this film and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches like the ones mentioned above but at the same time it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up and these subsequent steps go miserably awry the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity in one early scene paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn t look like it was all stolen not a bad idea when thornton screws up as he does continuously throughout the movie and paxton has to do some major covering up read homicide instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands washing raimi shows a lengthy painful shot from a low angle onto paxton s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion there s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective but the previous shot is even better more morally complex and more gut wrenching in short probably the best piece of direction raimi s ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results for further proof watch persona s sex scene and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman s ever done but the film hardly stops here it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical with aid from his pregnant wife played by bridget fonda a pal to raimi he does and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights there s at least two grand shootouts and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history and when they arrive they don t come with masochistic delight but with cringe inducing horror during the one i was actually sinking into my chair with the mantra they can t do this can they streeming through my head in fact this film which is getting many comparisons to the coen s superior but forget about it fargo has many similar moments of manic insanity attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what in other hands would be over the top distractedness imagine i suppose robert rodriguez directing this then again after seeing the evil dead films i d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed raimi moments a rifle shot notwithstanding instead raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch easily letting the story and characters co exist while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out like some offbeat comic touches most particularly billy bob thornton s character jacob is a brilliant creation his dim wittedness is often hilarious for most of the film every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter but there s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we re not totally laughing at him the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full condescension because thornton is so damn real jacob s a multi dimensional character and while being stupid we see that as not so much a flaw but a strength to his character his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and co conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money the final third of the film spends much time with him and many of the touches upon his character not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b smith adapting his own book by the way are just great i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near sweetness and further strength of his saddened character thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance by far the best performance he s ever given and further proof that he s the best character actor in contemporary cinema if you don t believe me go back and watch his wonderful performance in primary colors a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn t been in the same year because he s easily able to slip into a character and make him completely and utterly believable he brings so much weight to the film that as it is with most character actors it s difficult picturing anyone else in the role the rest of the cast is great too from paxton s declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows off her talents nicely and if i had any complaints about the film it s that the plot is almost too simplistic and that at times it seems too much like an exercise like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved and the occasional narration is as it usually is annoying narration should be used with extreme caution especially when you re trying to set things up and or express emotions didn t raimi watch the first murder scene and the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie the ending is basically amiss i won t reveal it but it s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set up as if the appearance of a plane wasn t already too much of that anyway for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved this is the wrong ending imagine a character controlled ending otherwise it s like if in crime and punishment if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing not that i m at all comparing a simple plan to dostoevsky the ending does work despite my protestations but to me there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it then just ignore me and go about your day but despite my mere claims make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured not because of any kind of gore factor which is thankfully for this very minimal but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece 
the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam fitting since the media saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment while driving through a long flat iraqi desert in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament one of the men under special forces sgt maj archie gates who s steering command requests a beach boys tune these men want their apocalypse now moment only instead of surfing they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle armed with automatic rifles our three kings okay four are good fighters but they don t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously it s a reprieve from their hellish day jobs they are gates new father sgt troy barlow wahlberg sgt chief elgin cube and pvt conrad vig music video director jonze at story s start president bush has declared a ceasefire and american troops are tying up loose ends barlow elgin and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an ass map that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation he proposes demands that barlow elgin and vig join him on a treasure hunt ditching his escort a relentless reporter named adriana cruz nora dunn is easy so is finding the treasure until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq saddam s men are threatening the dictator s detractors citizens of his own country with violence when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck ready to loot the unarmed rebels want help bush encouraged them to rise up against the government but provided no military support for such cause gates convinces the vault s guards that this is a post war mission and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck the situation could go off without a hitch the former enemies bear no grudges but the money hungry gates has a conscience and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene he orders barlow elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces the result barlow is kidnapped and the filmmakers imply that these would be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device his interrogator lost his family to the bombs and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child he does in chilling lasting images i liked these scenes best because the political became personal it s one thing to champion the plight of thousands it s another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib russell has shocked us before his first film spanking the monkey is about a young man s affair with his bedridden mother it s great his second flirting with disaster features a character who has an armpit fetish one could argue that it s easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions though russell disturbs us in three kings by being no nonsense about the violence when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home russell mutes the sound we re paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast three kings is russell s first visually arresting picture stylistically it stands apart from other war dramas newton thomas sigel s cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy which is of course entirely appropriate one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen a friend enthusiastically added it s like having sand in your eyes this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade three kings was shot in arizona california and mexico russell throws plenty at sigel s camera for it to observe as was the case with russell s previous efforts the most absurd moments are also the film s most realistic even the most poignant we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside if anything three kings settles down and stops surprising us its climax is pure hollywood no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie minded russell subsequently the characters become more cartoonish barlow s post torture revelry felt phony and chief a strong presence in the first third fails to escape the god fearing ultra serious anti racist black man of power clich so much for cube avoiding token status the arab players on the other hand duck stereotype clooney too transforms into a blandly heroic protestor marching with the rebels i waited for him to shout let my people go hayseed vig notwithstanding the protagonists are very intelligent and self serving too i had a glimmer of hope based on russell s filmography that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture it s not spoiling much to write that then again what historical importance would such nastiness serve there s already enough cynicism in the film s mentioning of kuwait s oil infested waters russell offers the masses a primer on the oft dismissed gulf conflict and pulled off a neat trick a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared if he set out to make something socially culturally politically globally significant he succeeded with flair 
a wonderful little movie that is really interested in its characters and in its theme the scene of second best is laid in wales james chris cleary miles is a year old boy who must live in a home because his father keith allen is in prison and his mother committed suicide james is a mentally unbalanced child he can t forget what happened in the past and he dreams of living a happy life with his beloved father in the home he feels sadly and lonely one day a social worker alan cumming tells him of a person who wants to adopt him this person is graham holt william hurt graham manages a post office and shop in a village he is a single and hasn t any real friends his mother is dead and his father is ill and will die graham feels that he has been a disappointment to his parents there has never been real love between his parents and him graham s monotonous life would get a new sense if he could adopt james but graham has not only to convince the institutions but must also win the love of james james and graham have to open theirselves they must get to know each other and learn to understand and trust the other person james and graham aid each other to cope with their problems but will their relationship really have a future second best is based on a novel by david cook who also wrote the screenplay the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing debut with the very good anti apartheid drama a world apart and maybe second best is even a greater picture this precise richly detailed sensitively and convincingly directed study about a special adoption treats its theme with great seriousness the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact and communication william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in the role of the boy the supporting cast is also fine especially jane horrocks as debbie a social worker who is charged to examine graham s living circumstances second best is an underestimated masterpiece it s a pity that films like this one are made so seldom i eagerly await menges next directorial work the lost son which will star daniel auteuil 
when you go to the movies as much as i do you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times such was the case with frequency every time i went to a screening there was the frequency preview it looked awful it looked cheesy sappy and ridiculous it looked like a flop well whoever put that trailer together should be fired because in terms of pure entertainment frequency is one of the best of the year thus far frequency boasts a compelling story line an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan james caviezel to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan dennis quaid through a ham radio despite the fact that frank has been dead for years john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire but by doing so causes other changes somehow a serial killer s reign of terror which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders extends to ten victims including john s mother this is director gregory hoblit s third film the other two being primal fear and fallen with all three he s managed to attach himself to great scripts this one by toby emmerich whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films and add equally great direction also he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick ass ending frequency is no exception the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying hoblit is three for three and i hope he can keep it up now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci fi elements of frequency but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved who s to say how something works and how it doesn t when it s never happened is it because we ve become accustomed to time travel laws from other places like star trek and the back to the future trilogy and quantum leap yes if you sit down and think about it certain plot elements in this film probably won t make any sense most films are like that don t let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however when frequency was over it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug okay okay shut up when you break it down past all its sci fi elements and serial killer antics frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share it s touching it s sincere and it s what ultimately makes this movie work pg 
james jones one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual a veteran of world war ii and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence a trait which lends itself to razor sharp focus but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel the thin red line now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick the book s principal cast some thirty characters has been trimmed down for this rendition but it still retains its most endearing value each of the roles has an everyman quality emphasizing jones examination of world war ii on the american soldier there s a definitive chain of command present and this also plays on the motivations of the cast but most importantly and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie a dynamic and effective voice over is used malick has several characters relating their thoughts giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake the issues at stake are many and one told from a limited third person perspective as opposed to a top down omniscient view the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company c for charlie to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war and want to win the war they do in an excellent performance nick nolte plays c for charlie s commanding officer lt col gordon tall he s an aging soldier who embodies the win at all costs mentality if only to impress his superior john travolta in a questionable cameo this philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros elias koteas who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command at the front are the privates and corporals adrien brody james caviezel ben chaplin et al lead by st sgt welsh sean penn who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them the thin red line is filled with intense visual poetry but it s nearly three hours long although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours the climax comes forty five minutes before the end of the movie it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end the thin red line will doubtless be compared to s other masterpiece of war saving private ryan a countless number of times but to do so is to belittle both films for although similarities abound so do differences director malick has a story to tell and for those interested in listening this can be a very outstanding movie 
synopsis as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case if she can survive the demanding s e a l training she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps throw in a lot of political machinations sabotage brutality water and sand and you have an entertaining movie review the title of this movie turned me off at first i mean gi jane the other titles which were considered were more promising in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i m concerned i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie moore as lieutenant jordan o neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men the storyline is simple anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless machiavellian politician with an agenda to push using feminism to achieve political mileage she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s e a l training jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all looks brains and strength the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch nonetheless it s one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero heroine along in his her endeavours sure there are the stereotypical elements inhuman treatment sexual innuendo resentful peers pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer stepping away from the stereotypes though viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character jordan s boyfriend royce is also in the military although they both started at the same time due to the fact that he has seen active service he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has royce what is his surname do we care almost resents jordan s attempts to advance herself although he quickly settles down to being doe eyed and supportive his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don t have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military in parts this is a very silly movie with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it s hard not to cringe i still liked it though weaknesses in the script aside this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood as we watch jordan s battle it s increasingly clear that it is a personal battle this is an individual s fight for self advancement we don t have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings we don t have to feel uncomfortable because we re having ideology thrust down our throats it s enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not 
this summer one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham s series a time to kill was made into a major motion picture on january of this year director rob reiner basically re released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi based on the true story of civil rights leader medgar evars assassination ghosts of mississippi revolves around the year legal battle faced by myrlie evars whoopi goldberg sister act and her quest to have her husband s obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith james woods casino jailed so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter alec baldwin heaven s prisoners to imprison the former kkk member ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african american history from slave ship miseries to life in the racist south of the s but all too soon the white folks take over intoning lines like what s america got to do with anything this is mississippi as beckwith james woods with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man teeters between portraying evil and its character meanwhile goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn t let her husband s death rest until she got the conviction both deserve serious oscar consideration this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin let s face it trying to match matthew mcconaughey s wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible and baldwin is living proof of this as no emotions could be felt it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear either poor acting or poor directing but something definitely went wrong another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg s facial features didn t change as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband s dead body years earlier yet woods was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg s father at least the make up was realistic with some emotional moments in the poorly written script ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart when its predecessor a time to kill brought tears to everyone s eyes don t get me wrong the movie wasn t all that bad but if you ve seen grisham s masterpiece then don t expect this one to be an excellent film

good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here in this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an off handed but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud s grand daughter esther freud who traveled here in the s with her mother and sister it is written by the director s brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls the girls readily accept him and there is no big to do made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really don t know what to make of the relationship it especially bothers bea who is embarrassed by her mother s loose attitude and wants to go home things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village it seems only that bilal s charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has a wife who still lives there this scene didn t make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also but i doubt that the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many a drop out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves the family s travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts it will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldn t comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories a gift from god the film s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby boom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the film s strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girls are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who cares about the children but doesn t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she s at this is a very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being and after all is said and done who s to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was 
the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly films and tv movies produced in italy between and his death in the early s more practiced as a cinematographer than a director bava nonetheless sat in the director s chair for beyond the door ii the project which turned out to be his last full length feature film alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci beyond the door ii is simply a revelation in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the s note that the film has no connection with the exorcist rip off behind the door but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia this story focuses on dora a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco the film opens with dora her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband s suicide and her subsequent trauma years earlier they hope to put the past behind them but as small accidents start to befall dora usually while bruno is away on business she starts to suspect that marco played with uncanny ability by year old david colin jr is somehow involved in the strange goings on to reveal any more of the story would be unfair suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot loads of atmosphere and solid acting though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi wife of famed italian horror director dario argento her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora s troubled soul the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective mixing odd sounding s rock with classic gothic piano sequences and there is at least one moment brilliantly engineered by bava that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair yet for italian horror the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal lamberto bava and francesco barbieri s script is more concerned with deeper psychological terrors with themes of guilt and suffering with the notion that what we sow will shall somewhere somehow eventually reap scholars of the genre take note beyond the door ii is stylish chilling and essential 
after the press screening of moulin rouge i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues everyone seemed a bit numb understandable after sitting through a barrage of often incongruous sounds and images a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production while a woman who flat out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye when one fellow quietly stated i ve never really been a fan of musicals the statement surprised me because even though the story is told almost completely through song i didn t think of it as a musical there is so much going on in moulin rouge that musical seems too small a term to cover it moulin rouge is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience australian director baz luhrmann the man behind strictly ballroom and romeo juliet fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork opulent imagery and songs ranging from the sound of music to smells like teen spirit sumptuous and beautiful vulgar and overdone moulin rogue travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with years worth of catchy tunes operates on the random setting oh and it has a story as well it was the summer of love christian ewan mcgregor is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris to write about truth beauty freedom and love where he encounters a group of bohemians led by henri de toulouse lautrec john leguizamo christian meets satine nicole kidman a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor at once fragile and vivacious the dazzling red haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler jim broadbent christian writes an opus modestly named spectacular spectacular zidler quickly finds a backer the wealthy duke of monroth richard roxburgh but there s a catch the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine as if all that isn t enough satine has a cough and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land like a teeter totter moulin rogue moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales together they dance while serenaded by the man in the moon alessandro safina provides the vocals apparently transported from the classic georges m li s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky other scenes merely traffic in everything and the kitchen sink overload the cavorting of toulouse lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy accompanied by cartoon sound effects is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like bewitched beat into the ground of course sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind we never heard from baz to turn it down one of the actors told the los angeles times it was always more more the director even sent a note to his cast reading i dare you to make me say you ve gone too far the musical numbers reflect his attitude one knockout piece the elephant love medley incorporates the beatles all you need is love u s in the name of love dolly parton s i will always love you and elton john and bernie taupin s your song need more how about diamonds are a girl s best friend spiced with portions of material girl luhrmann s cast offers a wide variety of approaches that together add up to something messy but often wonderful ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian emphasizing the sincerity of the love struck poet mcgregor s singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments once labeled the ice queen nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling yet tender performance she handles the songs adroitly although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler wait until you see him perform like a virgin as the buffoonish duke richard roxburgh proves to be the film s weakest link although i m sure he was simply following instructions i suspect moulin rogue will be one of those love it or hate it films while i didn t completely love it i most certainly liked it a lot over the course of a year i see well over movies and most of them look like xeroxes of each other moulin rogue is an original and an original even a flawed one is a thing to be cherished 
as i write the review for the new hanks ryan romantic comedy you ve got mail i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet i am also aware that i have just spent the last hours watching the world s biggest paid commercial for america online and i wonder is that so bad well the commercial part is as for the movie well as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan i think i ll be okay to paraphrase james berardinelli whose reviews i admire very much tom hanks and meg ryan can act they are both wonderful but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan and his glorious triumph in philadelphia i like him best when he s suitably obnoxious tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he s going to get the girl the only question is how meg ryan america s high school sweetheart can act she s had a handful of memorable performances including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally i must not mention what she does due to the well um you get the idea and if you don t get the movie fantastic but i like her best when she s well perky she is so adorably perky cute that together with hanks they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples but i don t really know all i know is that i just like them both they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that s really hard to resist and i m not going to even try they re just really really cute sweet and charming hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle here the setup is a little different kathleen kelly ryan owns a small children s bookstore which her mother founded years ago and passed down to her she is successful beautiful and dates a well known columnist with very radical idea kinnear she is also having an affair of sorts you see kathleen with the handle shopgirl is secretly emailing ny they have a strictly un detailed relationship there are no specifics and they have no idea who each other is ny happens to be joe fox hanks a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega bookstores run by his father coleman fox books has decided to open a store on the west side right across from a little children s bookseller named shop around the corner run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly every morning these two email each other silly and every day they fight to the death it s a charming premise and one that works nicely balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have it also has the great sense of being a classic romance there is no let s have sex tonight mantra if you ll excuse my bluntness this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love hmm well the movie goes through twists and turns having some sad moments and happy ones until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan hook up to use modern terminology and kiss their way into happiness you know it s going to happen the question is now thankfully ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey kinnear chappelle and a host of others including a great scene involving brothers aunts and two sweet kids it s all cute and wonderful and for all of the idealism it makes me feel good hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is he is i believe america s greatest actor does he show it here nah but he s still tom hanks and she s still meg ryan which is what this movie boils down to it s pure confection all the bits about the godfather the jokes the superb script it s all really sweet there are some immense flaws like pacing the last third of the movie really doesn t work as well as i would have liked and for a romantic comedy it s slow once hanks knows the secret it gets really slow i even looked at my watch a couple times to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for so that i could get home at a reasonable hour the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated e mail when my kids are my age i don t know what we ll be using but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history they just work together and it s nice to see it gives you well a smile the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was i ve always believed that movies are very powerful very powerful indeed you see mankind has three abilities he needs to survive the ability to think entertain and procreate movies can definitely do the first two and as for the third well i d rather not think about that i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint and that films that entertained you were good because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had hanks was the driving force behind one of the year s best films in saving private ryan which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world he s also half of the glue behind the year s best example of pure entertainment tom hanks and meg ryan are magical as is this movie it s a sweet lovely affair with a technology twist it may be a long commercial but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face 
with the success of the surprise hit alien directed by ridley scott a sequel was inevitable in fact after watching the first film a sequel was wanted particularly by this reviewer handing over the director s chair to recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous to this one pirahna ii a surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron a household name the alien series got a face lift of immense proportions instead of being a suspense science fiction film cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created a film like aliens comes along only once in a while and when it does audiences are usually unprepared for it i never saw this movie in theaters but i wish i could have the terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen with a science fiction plot cameron gives aliens added testosterone pumping up the action and fire power from the original film in fact aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero or heroine as the case may be never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual but because of weaver s presence a woman is the only suitable hero aliens begins years after alien ended lieutenant ellen ripley weaver is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens but the company is doubtful they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left despite stern warnings from ripley the company remains rigid and won t call the families back however when the company loses contact with the colony ripley s story seems much more feasible one of the company s directors carter burke paul reiser wants to gather a team to travel to the planet this team includes a buff private vasquez jenette goldstein a questionable corporal hicks michael biehn and a loyal android bishop lance henriksen burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony arriving on the planet the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon type environment the only survivor is year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become and she becomes newt s surrogate mother ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened and soon all hell breaks loose aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott s version it also multiplies the number of aliens in general alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens and as a result the chills are incredibly heightened then again this is james cameron the guy who has given us true lies and terminator judgment day he is the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only he could create something as terrifying as this film it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes and aliens has the motherload with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion i can t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout never dropping for a moment just when you think the movie is over something else will occur and it starts right back up again with a seemingly endless conclusion aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen using flawless special effects the climax is exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety of course for a film of this genre to work properly the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see aliens is completely realistic even a decade after its initial release the special effects are wonderfully seamless with a terrifying alien to go with them one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music composed by cameron regular james horner horner has created a terrific score receiving an oscar nomination for his work not only that horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film or science fiction film ever and that includes a space odyssey which was mainly a compilation of well known composers in fact the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music the production design is incredible which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well lit locations normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer aliens uses lights to scare the viewer then of course is the cinematography which uses point of view shots along with video feeds in order to build suspense some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley surprisingly the acting is not only above average for this genre but some of the best sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard edged persona weaver soars above the rest in this film but she is supposed to carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child developing a three dimensional character from her quiet attitude lance henriksen is terrific as bishop showing that androids don t always have to be flat characters jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role and steals several scenes of her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn t fighting michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film however biehn does a good job making it seem original again paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages to pull it off quite well however i still see him as paul on tv s mad about you a very good cast which also includes bill paxton and william hope highlights this action film making it stand out from others aliens is rightfully rated r for violence gore language and terror aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre as alien was more of a suspense horror film aliens pumps up the stakes and cameron directs it with professional quality cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen technically astonishing aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed aside from this you probably won t experience anything like aliens for quite a while 
capsule the best place to start if you re a jackie chan newcomer roars along never stops for breath and frequently hilarious to talk about jackie chan as a stuntman is to miss a million things jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today but also a very funny guy he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger used to make me laugh he s funny just standing there copping a look supercop has jackie making us laugh scream duck root and gasp for breath often all in the same scene it s actually the third in a loosely related series of movies each with jackie playing kevin chan a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck deep into trouble and then karate kicking his way out of it the others are also worth seeing it s a little slow to start but once it gets moving it s a field day the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china which requires him to collaborate with the attractive and ass kicking chief fo chinese security played here by the ever enjoyable michelle yeoh there s a fun chemistry between the two of them especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail all undercover of course and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss the drug boss however has problems of his own his wife s on trial for many of his own crimes and she s got the key to an account with all of his drug funds this means of course endless trouble not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he s out in the field and she sees him with this other woman and but that s one of the movie s unique pleasures the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly action there is of course non stop action in this movie everything from one on one kung fu to all out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines outrunning the hong kong coast guard there is also a virtuoso climax which features among other things jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter a wrong way freeway chase which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the copter as well as a motorcycle you get the idea this is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food quick enjoyable filling watch it with friends when they stop making movies like this the world will be a tad greyer 
a common complaint amongst film critics is why aren t there more literate scripts available quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn t dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content paul attanasio s script takes what could have been a tepid thriller the quiz show scandals of the late s and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors the film is riddled with telling symbols e g a chrysler a radio announcement of sputnik but is never heavy handed deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script redford departs from the usually overlight cable tv quality sets and camera work so common in recent th century period pieces quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years although i was only years old when the twenty one scandal broke enough of the s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford s almost tangible palette from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism of a generation that had gone through years of depression and world war without disposable income before the manifestation of its american dream the film deftly weaves several themes together from assimilation and exclusion of jews from the good life to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father s fame though the s audience that is rocked by this scandal may initially seem naive to us they should appear all too familiar with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day the tv audience is almost a fourth main character always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf at the film s end the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same s tv audience mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret this mirror may reflect an image we re not all that comfortable with 
after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction jackie brown seems like something of a light hearted departure for quentin tarantino it s more of a ho hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language luckily his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer the story introduces us to a street wise black woman named jackie brown pam grier a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another she works for a bottom of the barrel airline and receives a minimal salary but one day she is picked up by a pair of federal officials including michael keaton as the tough nosed ray nicolet and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell samuel l jackson who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle through to them under nicolet s nose with the help of ordell s oaf of a partner robert de niro and drugged out lady friend bridget fonda also entering the picture is a bail bondsman named max cherry robert forster who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated how i won t say the big drop off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown in which numerous double crosses take place and many clothing store bags filled with cash switch hands it s unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there and doesn t offer anything extremely compelling while doing so there are as always amusing exchanges between characters the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq or lack thereof the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie a year old white bail bondsman and a year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry you ve got to commend the acting jackie brown is a seriously dragged out exercise enlivened by such fine acting the film clocks in at a lengthy hours minutes tarantino s talky style manages to hold your attention heavily but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline also fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear jackie brown has four major shootings and two of those take place mostly off screen so don t be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath you can expect frequent foul language mostly coming way of ordell who much to the dismay of spike lee uses the n word as part of his regular vocabulary the acting is the glue that holds everything together grier making a sudden comeback from her reign in the s is more than adequate for the title character in fact she s flat out great another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster who does a grand job as max cherry and is perfectly cast in doing so michael keaton makes his presence felt albeit in small but dignified moments and de niro is ideal in playing the lug head who goes over the edge speaking of that bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell s bikini clad beach babe and yet she manages to look fairly occupied there s not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie which is a life saver for mr tarantino the story barely holds together in the meantime and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake but oh well jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work let s just hope that the director hasn t gone soft on us 
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer professor with such lived in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance ever since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid s in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world you d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good natured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open in wonder boys his performance isn t showy or a tour de force it s simple yet truthful he embodies grady a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms grady points out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy their target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges he s portentous and gloomy as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers though his act is a little too calculated he reminds me of the self imposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and with his spiked hair dyed snow white leer is similar a guy who equates quirks with depth tobey maguire fits well in the role with his round sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude but unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to he s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility katie holmes plays hannah a beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in grady s pants this is a plot line i had trouble with douglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady maybe it s because i m jealous and wish holmes was throwing herself at me after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth then i think of douglas s real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and i m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas there is a movie in there somewhere grady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell a droll frances mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor okay maybe not so chivalrous there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says she was a junkie for the printed word lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice robert downy j r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual he s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance the actor is perfectly cast here and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor i wish wonder boys had more of him searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless for it meanders through its running time but that s part of its charm and maybe i m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia a place i m greatly fond of and a place rarely explored in american cinema everyone has a sub genre be it war films westerns dance movies that they happen to be privy to i m privy to films about literary types i e those individuals enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters rather than generic mapped out story points sometimes the dialogue is too clever but that s a problem i wish i found with films more often another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted like its characters but as the story progresses it begins to open up for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types and as a low key comedy for its chuckle worthy throwaway gags the gags are like those in the great robert altman m a s h the long goodbye movies where jokes exist as asides on the fringes like jokes in life often do the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isn t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things curtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rocks the cradle has graduated to more meaningful films he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in a wonder boys party it fits the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen it s the cinematic equivalent to a good read novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies many will find it slight but i found much to savor among its subtleties 
a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today s youth seem attracted to black culture the review if black white the new film from writer director james toback is eventually remembered for only one thing it will be the revelation that brooke shields claudia schiffer marla maples and mike tyson can act however this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that black white is a fascinating film it makes a statement about america s youth and hip hop culture without getting heavy handed overly serious featuring a cast of known commodities ben stiller robert downey jr and hot newcomers singers bijou phillips toback s is a complex film worth seeing black white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other a la robert altman there is dean the basketball player allan houston who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear stiller in exchange for fifty grand a game this eventually spills over into the life of dean s long time friend rich power a gangsta who controls city blocks of harlem rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white owned club on his turf meanwhile the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager shields and her gay husband terry downey jr others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will joe pantoliano as his district attorney father jared leto as a high school teacher marla maples as the mother of one of hip hop crazed teens claudia schiffer as dean s girlfriend and mike tyson as mike tyson the stories ebb and flow through the film losing and gaining prominence over time friendships are lost lovers are gained and there is an occasional burst of violence originally rated nc in the united states black white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing the three way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for and several audience members got up and left at that point the frequent sex is one of the film s few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film to toback s credit the level of violence in black white is almost nil these gangstas and hip hop artists are given real problems and concerns and only become gun toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way whenever a character finds himself on donager s handheld digital camera he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence but not everyone has fully bought into the idea charlie phillips is full of bluster about why she loves hip hop but admits that in ten years time i ll be way over this these youth know they are going through a phase and are simply enjoying it toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny most of the humour comes from mike tyson who provides the film s comic relief without really trying he is given big words like vernacular to say and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better playing on tyson s image as a dimwit but tyson also gets the film s scariest moment as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm the scene is entirely improvised with downey jr being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction the reaction he gets being slapped and then choked is astonishing as downey jr s face turns a frightening shade of purple black white is a film about hip hop culture and the film s omnipresent hip hop soundtrack strongly supports this but toback keeps things from becoming too serious by moving from story to story as quickly as he does toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character s struggle thus black white s message about hip hop becomes secondary to the film itself toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip hop along the way and we do 
one of the sweetest tales to ever be made it s a wonderful life isn t perfect but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results probably the greatest feel good film of all time it s a wonderful life aims for the heart and strikes with a golden arrow on christmas eve george bailey stewart is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls you see george is in trouble and he has always helped others who needed it this one time however god answers his prayers and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence travers to try and save george clarence has got his own problems however clarence is an angel without his wings and each time the bell rings the wings pass him by the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel but before clarence can save george he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey s life we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother s life sacrificing his college education to save the family business sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else when the bank his family owns is in trouble george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn t sold to the evil mr potter barrymore who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls one christmas potter gets his chance uncle billy bailey mitchell loses of the bank s money without the money the bank must close down george is stuck in a tremendous bind and contemplates suicide clarence the faithful servant is there just to pick him up and to show him what bedford would be like without george this is all a lead in to the very famous last scene where george finally sees what true happiness is about it s a wonderful life does have its faults the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details especially in the treatment of women and men the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the s like something out of a revisionist look all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film there are however endearing moments in all of this capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable the story is hackneyed and the ending feels well a little too sugarish there s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything especially the sequences where george is either in trouble or helping somebody it s a little too nice for my liking at times there is however enough humor enough wit and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part which would be the most difficult but watching it s a wonderful life is never boring or difficult it s always interesting right until the finale which for all its sugar makes delightful sense and is beautifully done capra does have his monumental cliches but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection donna reed is perfect as the loving obeidient wife and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr potter everyone else is magnificent including bert and ernie ward bond and frank faylen there is a general sense of goodness as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film and they relish that stewart however is the king of all of this he is sometimes awkward especially when saying merry christmas to all objects animate or inanimate but he is james stewart and he s lovably delightful throughout the film have i complained i shouldn t have this is a really good movie no this is a great movie better yet this is a phenomenal movie there is a reason classics are invented to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life this is one of those films it is a feel good movie something people complain a little too much about but capra s reworking of a christmas carol is the greatest christmas movie of all time there i ve said it i have to admit the first time i saw this i saw it with my family including my year old kid sister they all loved it they loved george his wife his troubles and the beautiful ending is it a little too sugar coated maybe no matter this is a film that should be watched time and time again with families around a coffee table and eggnog on the plate it is a film that just makes you feel good about life family and hope it is the perfect christmas film flaws and all it is frank capra s greatest acheivement and that really does say a lot for about out of minutes this movie is flawless the rest can be excused no film is perfectly flawless i can t get over how much i love this movie and how much you will after watching it digesting it and sitting with your family appreciating how special life really is 
american pie acknowledges a cold hard fact that most movies don t it is very difficult to get laid its four virgin heroes are jim biggs a chronic masturbator kev nicholas who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend reid oz klein a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning and finch eddie kaye thomas a germphobe his crass nickname is hilarious but i won t spoil it here who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member jim kev oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it s no wonder they re horny all the time after a party at their studly friend stifler s seann william scott in the film s sharpest performance house leaves them sexually unsatisfied the quartet make a pact to lose it by graduation specifically prom night which is only a few weeks away american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin whoopee all women are there to be ogled alyson hannigan s perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and or amuse its core audience adolescent boys to arouse nadia s shannon elizabeth internet striptease an unexpectedly raucous and guiltily pleasurable sequence to amuse jim s lusty encounter with a hot apple pie what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids is a cast that s light years more appealing than that of say just one of the guys two more standouts klein and sctv s eugene levy klein plays a kind hearted athlete for the second time in a row after alexander payne s underappreciated election i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon levy s is the most crowd pleasing performance and indeed it s nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents would let you watch growing up it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes much like john hughes movies did and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds don t you forget about me the picture ultimately has a healthy if obligatory attitude towards safe sex even at their most libidinous american pie s protagonists first whip out a condom the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible for its familiarity and for its charming leads i recommend american pie but the buzz on this film had me expecting something fresher as far as the new teen cinema goes it s at the top of the heap don t say i didn t warn you about the party scene 
jonathan demme s beloved based on the book toni morrison is a study in skillful literary adaptation on the one hand the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel evoking morrison s pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice on the other hand beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story s main events this choice is a smartly made one for it creates an open space in which the story s wide range of emotions can gestate and grow indeed the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled beloved takes place in the second half of the th century during the so called reconstruction era after the civil war for newly freed slaves it is a time of confusion and turmoil oprah winfrey is sethe a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse where she hoped the terror would end what she did not know was that it would follow her there and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished beloved ultimately tells the story of sethe s search for forgiveness one long hampered by an unforgettable sin the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe s escape as a violent unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse invisible hands terrorize her family flinging objects across rooms shaking tables rattling floorboards sethe s sons run away perhaps for good leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves demme s matter of fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of beloved s intriguing aspects all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real when paul d danny glover a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost s hellish visions he doesn t run in terror instead he asks who the ghost is as in morrison s novel demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created sethe is the one being haunted but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears in fact the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved thandie newton a young black clad woman who appears on sethe s front lawn leaned christ like against a tree stump sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health they know not who she is but that doesn t matter only paul d is suspicious of the stranger little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years winfrey is arguably beloved s greatest asset she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d as is kimberly elise as denver sethe s wanderlusting daughter as sethe s sage like mother in law old baby suggs beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears the film s least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself thandie newton plays the glassy eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first but which becomes off putting and unintentionally laughable by the end departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as the silence of the lambs and melvin howard director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison s novel totemic camera shots and color saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme s films but the few he uses here work to the film s benefit beloved s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs gatherings in a forest clearing where the bright yellow greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs words do for the most part though demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality this combined with morrison s equally frugal method of storytelling may make beloved somewhat of a challenge to watch even to those familiar with the book though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film nothing is spoon fed to the viewer morrison s novel is just as enigmatic but unlike a movie a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb the movie begins like poltergeist and ends like the color purple with shades of the scarlet letter and little women somewhere in the middle taken as a whole beloved is a disquieting one of a kind experience one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance 
capsule earthy experimental difficult shockingly frank even for and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops the first few minutes of sweet sweetback s baad asssss song yes i checked that s the correct number of ss are without dialogue just eerie montages of sounds a young boy obviously malnourished is taken in and fed up by several loving mother surrogate figures then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation underneath the title credits that s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life something we re not used to seeing on screen this is one tough movie to swallow no matter who you are but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences the plot is simple but not simpleminded sweetback hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man breaks his bonds and runs like hell along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies or at all for that matter the slums the missions the ghetto in other lesser movies sweetback would be machine gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies in this one we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted ssbas first appeared in and was promptly rated x by an all white jury as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns and it s hardly surprising why there s a good deal of sex in the movie but it s handled in a way that s unsettlingly frank a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie in one scene sweetback visits a friend s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there and the other man chats him up while on the toilet we re not used to coming this close to people in real life let alone in the movies especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles hands one scene in which a man is interrogated by the cops is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack another note ssbas is not so much anti white that would be too easy as anti authority and as the movie goes on to demonstrate authority exists in many forms governments churches and even the paranoid inside of one s own mind ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet god knows 
in arguably the most anticipated movie this century george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence in the sound and special effects department in terms of characters by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala natalie portman whose mature performance far exceeds her tender years of age she is one hot babe who defines true woman leadership she not only has a presence but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything the young obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who has a bad hair day in every scene gets to kill a bad guy in the end but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners i mean it would be interesting to see yoda s girlfriend for a change if he has one not much better is qui gon jinn liam neeson who mostly broods and has a better hair do than obi wan but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life also fascinating is george lucas metoclorian theory which claims that micro organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force more humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it s predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan watch out for the next one it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker who i believe should be portrayed by leonardo di caprio 
ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances for his followup to the academy beloved the english patient he has once again turned to a love story this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong little women despite some obvious overplotting oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences the film opens in the mid s with parallel storylines in new south wales australia and devon england as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us lucinda leplastrier cate blanchett is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback meanwhile half the world away oscar hopkins fiennes has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest lucinda is fascinated with glass oscar is obsessed with theology lucinda is rich oscar is poor lucinda is forward and self assured oscar is timid and uncertain of himself yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals the compulsion to gamble whether it s on horses dogs cards or the flip of a coin and fate has decreed that they will one day meet that day doesn t occur until minutes into the film when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney australia where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help another of the passengers is lucinda who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly acquired glassworks factory at first their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor but it doesn t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other a friendship is born and once they reach australia it develops into something more potent but oscar is uncertain of lucinda s affection and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her oscar and lucinda isn t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions on more than one occasion it s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route coincidence is a crucial plot device without it this movie can t go anywhere the voiceover narration never one of my favorite techniques is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments however without it the final twist which i will not reveal would not be as poignant yet despite these quibbles i enjoyed oscar and lucinda storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely realized characters thematically the film is also strong the unifying motif that everything in life is a gamble is successfully delineated oscar and lucinda don t just wager their money they bet their hearts minds and souls a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional strip poker where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared secret passion oscar does not see gambling as a vice in fact he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith ralph fiennes who normally plays strong confident men is very much at home as the fumbling insecure oscar the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on screen as good as fiennes is however he is eclipsed by cate blanchett the actress who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford s paradise road is mesmerizing as lucinda she gives this liberated woman her flash and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles effective support is provided by ciaran hinds the male lead in jane austen s persuasion as lucinda s close friend tom wilkinson the full monty as oscar s mentor and clive russell as a self serving adventurer there s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence in fact i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act which has oscar and lucinda together with the skill of a consummate storyteller she weaves romance friendship passion humor and tragedy together into a complete package the characters with all of their human foibles and neuroses are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer 
a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates a film which was based on the best seller by george v higgins it is seen through the weary eyes of a year old small time hood eddie fingers coyle mitchum he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a year stretch in new hampshire something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn t think he could survive prison at his age he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare he could have cut a deal and gotten off if he turned his boss over to the d a but he figured he would never live if he did that he is currently gun running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise rocco the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager s house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it on one of the heists they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm coyle s best friend is dillon boyle a hit man for the mob working as a bartender he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents as an aggressive young agent named foley jordan who likes to be called uncle gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs with the sentencing date closing in on him the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain thinking he made an iron clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down knowing full well the young hustler keats selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence but foley tells him after he arrests the gun dealer that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence they want him to be a full time informer warning spoiler follows in next paragraph the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says to be young like that and have his future he s the greatest hockey player in the world dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob style having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets of the hopeless situation the low level criminals are in and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next the city streets are ugly the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests whether it is betrayal or murder there is a fatalistic feel about their lives something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs as it overcomes a thin plot it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them mitchum is a loser and that he lived so long is a tribute to his skills as a survivor but in the end he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle 
 say any of you know how to madison brad asshole majors barry bostwick shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend in the early s stage actor turned first time playwright richard o brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b movies he had grown up with as a child set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design the result was the stage play the rocky horror show which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in and was even hailed the best musical of by prominent drama critics in england the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later in october of the film version now titled the rocky horror picture show was released in and immediately tanked at the box office whether it was because fox wasn t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters a year later something entirely strange and magical happened prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country and it was then that a whole new audience found the film this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played yelling rude comments at the screen and just generally having a good time word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show s life as the ultimate cult film was born for the virgins out there who are unaware the plot centers around a loving couple brad majors barry bostwick and janet weiss susan sarandon who come from a small town called denton brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting dr everett scott jonathan adams who played the narrator in the original stage version but their car gets a flat on the way to his home remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual in the galaxy of transylvania who are lead by the eccentric fishnet stocking wearing mad scientist dr frank n furter tim curry frank n furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky peter hinwood as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank n furter s mad schemes little do any of them know that the doctor s handyman riff raff original author richard o brien and domestic magenta patricia quinn are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth going back and revisiting this film after ten years being the first time i had ever seen it it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release i don t think i would have known what to make of it either for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie though bad in a really good sort of way but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film by the time the credits role it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters and one really gets the feeling that richard o brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b movies his film is based on when i say that the wall to wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that once you hear them they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity it goes without saying that the time warp is the most popular song in the film even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song what those who haven t seen the movie don t know though is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment my personal favorite is over at the frankenstein place but dammit janet is also maddeningly catchy tim curry s vocals on the rocking tune sweet transvestite need to be heard to be believed the finale of the film a big floor show staged by frank n furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets including barry bostwick frightening features no less than four songs rose tint my world don t dream it wild and untamed thing and i m going home all of which are immensely singable the film s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though despite the catchiness of the songs this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans unless you don t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place note director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film in the form of a sequel resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment which picks up with brad and janet this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager also played by de young who wishes to claim janet as his own o brien returned as a writer performer on the project as did quinn campbell and gray in performance capacity only but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original years later this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans a brand new special edition disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its th anniversary if you are one of those people who can t get enough of the film this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film fox home entertainment has released this wonderful disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of enhanced for x televisions the film is presented in two different versions the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called superheroes for ambitious viewers the disc also includes a hidden version located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen originally the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz with the first half of the it seen in black and white and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number most reports including a documentary on the disc say that the color was supposed to appear when frank n furter first shows up in the elevator but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced the film contains a commentary track by show creator and faithful handyman richard o brien and co star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half naked on freezing cold sets which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore and there are quite a few fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments the first feature and the most simple is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is the second feature is an audience participation track which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd where a pair of lips will appear on screen during certain scenes of the film mostly during the musical numbers that can be selected by

plot during a week span in london in the fall of jack the ripper a man whose identity was never uncovered committed five ritualistic grisly murders of prostitutes this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century old mystery critique awesome i love dark movies i love stylish movies i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp so yes i really dug this movie the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously and this movie my friends is very serious in fact it s also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell it ain t for the kids i ll tell you that much and if any of those recent hack directors of two bit scream esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective kill scenes do not look any further because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner especially when compared to their generic slice and dice contrivances in fact most of this film s structure is very creative the actors all solid the atmosphere and feel of the picture remarkably real gotta love those unfortunates and the descent into darkness well honed by the filmmakers you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time but it s also an impressive mystery film based on the true life tale of jack the ripper a man whose identity was never discovered the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel from hell written by alan moore and presents a compelling story which despite being a little oliver stone ish did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem sexual depravity drug usage insanity murders and love yes the brothers even managed to slip a little love story in here and despite not truly being developed i guess it could ve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already that s right there s no real need to put any romance in a film about a mass murderer but that aside you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities to center this movie all the way through sure he s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie but she was fine and how little the dreams fantasies of depp s character had to do with the film s development from what i had seen in the trailer i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story but thankfully it wasn t on the downside the film doesn t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development but then again a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement i mean the less i knew about each person the more suspicious i became of each one s motives reasons etc in fact i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end and that was in part due to the distance to which i d been held from the film s characters or am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention perhaps overall this is an extremely creepy production with glorious cinematography reminiscent of coppola s dracula and burton s sleepy hollow a grim score and solid acting but it s not for everyone some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events and even though the murders aren t shown as graphically as you might think there s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable gothic atmosphere and this flick is just that and plenty more and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper s haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon brrrrr where s joblo coming from the crow dark city dracula jfk the nightmare before christmas the ninth gate the others quills shadow of the vampire sleepy hollow 
after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project making the third installment in the godfather trilogy this new film has been underrated for no reason it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla s pervious films it is also more psychological pessimistic and more tragic than the first two the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some unfinished developments of some characters the film elegantly begins with nino rota s recognizable musical score the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael s voice as he is writing a letter to his children the only wealth in this world is children more than all money and power on earth you are my treasure the year is and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of part ii to make his father s dream come true making the corleone family legitimate michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling constantly haunted by the past his only reason to live is his children the family has amassed unimaginable wealth and as the film opens michael corleone al pacino is being invested with a great honor by the church later that day at a reception his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily a check in the amount of million but the corleones are about to find as others have throughout history that you cannot buy forgiveness sure you can do business with evil men inside the church for all men are fallible and capable of sin but god does not take payoffs the plot of the movie concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican there is a moment in godfather iii where michael says all my life i have been trying to go up in society where everything was legal but the higher i go the crookier it becomes visually this film is as spectacular as the first two gordon willis rich cinematography carmine copolla s beautiful composition and alex tavoularis wonderful art direction could not be better but copolla s first two godfather films were more famous for their deep intellectual plots tree dimensional characters and incredible acting than for their visual perfection the third installment has only the plot and visuals some characters could be much more developed and the acting although good never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie that could have been grander and more emotional the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars andy garcia is powerful as sonny s son strong focused and loyal violence is natural to him he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family s behalf and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was however both kay diane keaton and connie talia shire are useless and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends that you remember from the first and second films in the third film michael has become almost like his father vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo s character was more developed many have pointed out that making the third film was unnecessary i disagree it is a beautiful film of great importance completing the tragic saga of the corleone family the first film showed some horrible results of corleone s life it showed michael making a choice the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times a man desperately trying to keep his balance focus family and sanity while everything is crashing all around him the third film is a terrifying conclusion a result of michael s life the life he chose for himself is like quicksand one wrong step and you are doomed there is no turning back and no matter how hard you try to get out of it to free yourself no matter how powerful and wealthy you are you are helpless sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film when michael is sitting alone in his chair left by everyone surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead here he dies alone miserable and unforgiven

at first glance three kings looks to be just another war movie the s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember the s version it definitely is just another war movie not in your dreams imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan that s three kings for you believe it or not it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war with the allied troops victorious majpr archie gates clooney leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post war looting spree the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home this wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum vee the vehicle of choice of the us army they soon find out that they have much resistance as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddam s forces frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hood s merry men they become consciously attacked by their own morals as the film begins to roll it seemed to have a rather light mood to it special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light hearted funny action movie three kings is much smarter than that as the conflict becomes more and more complex the audience will be trapped in a limbo trying to stay focussed on that light mood serious mood that the film seem to portray i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant action sequences are not shot as your old fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielberg s in your face war violence they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close ups and pauses right before the action starts not john woo for sure but more of sergio leone s spaghetti western style tons of them starring clint eastwood great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film the screenwriter and the director three kings ranks among the best films of the year well for me at least highly recommended 
an astonishingly difficult movie to watch the last temptation of christ may be scorsese s most important film and yet his most impossibly abstract as well scorsese presents the life of jesus christ through nikos kazantzakis novel which details the life of christ from approximately until the day of crucifixtion jesus of nazareth dafoe is a carpenter who opens the film making crosses so that he can escape the fate he is subjected to his destiny on earth yet he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others and subjects himself to a desert in exile in hopes that he can reach god before leaving he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene barbara hershey a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus after going to the desert christ learns his true purpose in life and what he must do aided by judas keitel he sets off on teaching the world his message along the way he meets john the baptist the rest of the prophets and tries to teach the world his message christ is also confronted by internal demons and self doubt as he tries to find his true purpose throughout the entire film during the story judas is the closese ally of jesus his betrayal argues the film was not out of hate but out of love in order to allow christ to die he is eventually captured and crucified as per the bibile however as he is about to die on the cross he is saved by a girl who brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene the girl is a guardian angel who is from god and who has saved him from his death jesus goes on to live a life as a man as a carpenter and does not die on the cross on his deathbed in the final moments of his life he is visited by the prophets and by judas who denounces his master for not keeping his end of the bargain judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act jesus escapes from his deathbed and asks his father for forgiveness for succumbing to his last temptation visually and aurally the film is absolutely breathtaking no other director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of christ s life to the screen peter gabriel contributes a score than is simply astonishing with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer the performances are simply exquisite with dafoe leading the way with a mesmerizing turn as jesus keitel although his accent is a problem is passionately brilliant fighting through language to bring the character to life the visuals are also amazing scorsese frames his movie in a harsh tone leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is having human frailties the film though has many trouble spots paul schrader s script is one schrader uses modern day new york english to tell the story along with new york words new york mannerisms and new york slang speech the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ there is no underlying message behind the man s words the film fails to capture the glory and splendor of christ had it faithfully explored that aspect than the dichotomy of jesus soul his frailties and doubt mixed with his unmistakable glory would have been simply spectacular the message of christ is confused between love and violence and the film merely tells us jesus is great instead of showing us his greatness the film is also overlong it just drags in the middle with nothing truly happening christ is a confused figure in the sense that the audience doesn t know who he really is schrader forgets to give jesus a message to show that he truly is the messiah to give him the divinity without that he is a rambling prophet who the audience themselves do not believe there are several moments of accidental hilarity and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach there are moments of brief awe and power followed by moments of confused hilarity that said the controversial temptation sequence is something to behold it is a step in an unexpected direction one that leaves the audience puzzled until the arrival of the disciples it is a simply breathtaking scene with jesus about to die as a mortal it is truly one of scorsese s finest moments it is unfortunate that scorsese couldn t make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene 
it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a i artificial intelligence just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home an outcast seeking family themes very familiar from most of spielberg s body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e t to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan naming just a few examples a i is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions and with the number of births limited by the government many couples are yearning for children and professor hobby william hurt has the solution a robotic boy named david haley joel osment who is programmed to love as a test david is placed with henry swinton sam robards and his wife monica frances o connor their natural born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness the first third of a i deals with david s life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son martin circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons he is abandoned and alone david highly influenced by the fairy tale pinocchio feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica s love for him the film s second act follows david s search for the blue fairy whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe jude law a robot who specializes in sex spielberg is at his top form in this sequence offering a brutal flesh fair where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers here is where kubrick s influence is strongly felt as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots the savagery conjures up images from the late director s a clockwork orange at about two hours and minutes the film begins to falter during the last minutes a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters it is all very anti climatic and jarring these scenes seem almost superfluous as if from a different film a i is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg rating it is a story combining hope and intolerance sacrifice and bigotry and while it does not coalesce perfectly the movie does offer some disturbing images but a i is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination it is this lad who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david a being created for the express purpose of loving he shines when with monica beaming with love as eager as a puppy to please after being left in the woods he is confused lost hurt focusing on one objective to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother s eyes law is pleasant as the care free robot who really doesn t understand david s quest but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey probably the toughest role is o connor s monica playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance but as a threat to her family she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action many of a i s futuristic sets are breathtaking especially a mostly submerged new york lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps a i is a flawed film and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering even subconsciously how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera would it have been darker more cynical we will never know we can only judge what is before us on the screen a collaboration of two cinematic giants a i is a most interesting and thought provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us 
in october of the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u spy plane fly overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles miles from the us president john kennedy bruce greenwood and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson s dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in thirteen days one of the highlights to come out of made for tv movies was a entry called missiles of october that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown that teleplay starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in now a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again the last time was for the taught spy thriller no way out to re enact the events of that most dangerous time in america s and the world s history taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p o donnell costner donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event once again as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war as o donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning he deals with the usual family crises and problems meanwhile a u spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment suddenly ken s routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat where thirteen days differs most from missiles of october is as expected in the scope of the project there is a big difference budget wise between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen it shows as the makers of thirteen days craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation the cast a true ensemble is led surprisingly by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner costner s o donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america s preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe but he knows that if the crisis comes to a head his family will be no more the meat of thirteen days is in the big picture not the microcosm of family though this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels the story does not just cover the face off between the world s two most powerful countries it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military cia the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army navy air force want to flex their might and invade cuba while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america s dignity and world leadership intact while the internal battle for power rages in the white house with air force chief curtis lemay kevin conway advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter the tension is palpable the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent instead he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president costner as ken o donnell is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor costner plays o donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast too standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un adlai stevenson who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy using old style video footage to good effect dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara kevin conway gives his general lemay the right bomb them to hell attitude also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who with his wingman takes on the dangerous mission of a low level photo recon into the heart of cuba bravely challenging kenny o donnell s admonition don get shot tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing it s an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right the special f x of the u sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year i give thirteen days an a 
seen may at p m at the crossgates cinema guilderland n y theater with my brother john for theater rating excellent seats sound and picture critic s note this review is the longest i ve ever written and still only scratches the surface i d recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of the phantom menace how do i even write this review never mind the fact that i ve been waiting for a new star wars movie since i was seven years old never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released never mind that there s so much going on in this movie in terms of plot action special effects and long term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn t cover everything and also like ted does in all of his reviews i ll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you the reader before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered to get the specifics of the film skip this and the next four paragraphs as has been made obvious for the last several years another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the missing initial three installments of the star wars series the first of the films was actually episode four not one george lucas the creator of the series has probably just assumed most people know the first produced trilogy star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi is actually the second trilogy chronologically in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order but i can t recall his reasons with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy err second trilogy well you know what i mean and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which unfortunately may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution critic s note it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule critic s note reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics law of reviewing movies which as roger ebert coined it s not what a movie is about but how it is about it because so many outside factors come into play in the film s plot and significance as part of a trilogy and just considering modern society it again would be difficult if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire we know obi wan ben kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of the force in attempts to become a jedi knight but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the dark side we also know something about the force itself that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it the jedi what we don t know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth to me this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle definite order to all the complexity also it seems that we re supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended most notably details regarding the emperor from empire and jedi and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine for those who haven t kept up with all the star wars paraphernalia over the years there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor or his voice at least with the phantom menace being the first chapter of a long saga one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid including the history behind all the major factors of the series especially the force and the jedi knights unfortunately this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained i didn t liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness if you re going to tell a story from the beginning tell it from the beginning is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes through to clarify the back story even further but i digress i ve said so much and yet i haven t even touched on the specifics of the film itself all these necessary disclaiming elements should go to show just how vast the story of the star wars series is and this individual film itself what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we ve come to know and love since the late s its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality the basic story is rather sorted complex and even confusing at times we re told that an army known as the trade federation has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo we re not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly we re introduced to two jedi the master qui gon jinn neeson and his apprentice obi wan kenobi mcgregor the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet s queen amidala portman the leader of the federation an alien called viceroy is following the orders of a strange mythical character an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance and especially that creepy evil voice of his he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity which is never openly revealed in the film but should be clear to most viewers i have a feeling we ll delve into his background in the next two films but it doesn t take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film s story begins to move along the film doesn t have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini plot and adventure on top of another there are so many of these mini plots within plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook the other films have relied on this type of storytelling but because of the limits of the technology at the time the films screenplays were also limiting the sense of limitlessness here is what gives the phantom menace its unique traits as we already know the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original star wars trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of year old anakin skywalker lloyd by qui gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council to briefly summarize the story jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala s spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force and through another sub plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before in fact it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary by the film s third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot it s funny how the reality of the star wars world seems so embedded in mythology new age like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence not that this technique hasn t been used in movies and in real life situations countless times throughout history and at least it s all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter it does border of the cartoonish sometimes but that s just the film appealing to our inner child which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society the phantom menace delivers exactly what you d expect from a star wars film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness so many things in the film we ve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies 
no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan i m referring specifically to the narrative form in the sweet hereafter egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster said story of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent british columbia that shatters the morale of the locals is told in a most unstraightforward manner when the film opens the accident has already happened and stephens the wonderful holm a polite ambulance chaser has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning throughout we get to meet the parents of the dead broken souls who follow stephens like the pied piper passages of which are read during the film but there is one living passenger the paralyzed nicole polley whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify we finally do see the accident about three quarters into the film which is a stunning visual effect a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding then stopping then collapsing into a frozen lake is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and perhaps ever in a motion picture the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane traveling to meet his hiv positive runaway daughter as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre accident i have a problem not with the story or story structure but with egoyan s heavy handedness behind the camera for the first hour or so i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears these are miserable miserable people but that s just the problem so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while when a lot of sadness becomes too much also a subplot involving incest rings untrue perhaps it wouldn t feel so contrived if it weren t shot in such a tasteful manner there are two characters who are father and daughter when they first appeared i thought they were lovers i was half right nevertheless it s worth seeing the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that american films are about action canadian films are about consequences hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors including crash and kissed the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films simply because it s not boring or in the case of kissed afraid of its own material necrophilia egoyan is a fine fine postmodern storyteller whose work is entertaining edgy and smart if a bit too intellectual at times though i harped on the weightiness of the material i was always absorbed engrossed and surprised by the sweet hereafter 
on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements in case you missed it warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail he says to a black congregation if you can t cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife you re never gonna get rid of me well there is such a plot and it works very well in this comedy beatty plays jay billington bulworth a long time democratic senator from california the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth s latest commercials condemning affirmative action the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv having gone without food or sleep for days his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe a million life insurance policy in his daughter s name then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination his assistant murphy oliver platt is oblivious to bulworth s suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african american church then takes questions from the audience he is hit hard with questions about his voting record he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots and it hasn t shown up since he s a dead man anyway he figures he ll answer truthfully he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l a for the photo opportunity they made some promises that improved their public image for a while and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made the shock and outrage from the congregation grows the questions keep coming and he keeps shooting back honest if ugly answers before i go further i d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make and that is that characterizing african americans as malt liquor drinking o j fans is not part of bulworth s truth that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics this line is not what they re talking about the experience is liberating with nothing left to lose bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth he can say whatever he wants because he s going to be dead anyway why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism bulworth s candor wins him three volunteers from the church one of whom nikki halle barry he gets a crush on he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something chicken wings appropriately enough bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment with so much money and so many talented people working so hard he wonders why can t hollywood make a quality product you go warren when they become indignant and ask why he s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product he callously admits that it s because they are rich jews that night he drops the three african american volunteers at their nightclub and he decides to go in with them he stays up all night drinking smoking pot dancing falling in love with nikki and learning to scratch turntables and rap the next day he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit and tie fundraisers from then on at all of his political appearances he raps his political truth his rap is not bad for a middle aged white guy he s not very good but it is his first try and at least he s not embarrassingly bad his lobbyists are not amused but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth eventually the movie s plot remember he hired a hit man overtakes the politics which is too bad screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes bulworth fleeing his killer these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along but it distracted and detracted from bulworth s political ranting which was much more interesting than the ever present obvious looking assassin still most of the movie is original and very enjoyable and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen as the story and screen writer he came up first with a good structure then with good dialogue to back it up jeremy pikser co wrote the screenplay as an actor he was able to convincingly portray bulworth s depression then liberation and rebirth as a producer there were four others he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood s indulgent formulas except for those inexcusable chase scenes someone else probably could have directed but since he was there anyway what the heck it s too bad that there aren t more movies like this around movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics after all much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants just don t expect to be popular with the insurance companies 
warning if you actually wish to see the film stop reading this and see it while i don t blow any plot details the more you know about a movie the more disappointing and built up it becomes waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing but in a nutshell it s a good film star wars episode i the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world i was more into star trek the next generation it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment the phantom menace however it can t be ignored endless toys lining the shelves endless news reports and a multi billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult with the level of this hype one would recall an overhyped disaster from godzilla which definitely failed to live up to expectations thankfully the phantom menace does much much better while the first star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker the prequels backpedal to tell the back story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader without blowing too much of the story the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation and it s up to two jedi knights qui gon ji played by liam neeson and obi wan kenobi played by ewan mcgreggor to free it the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat common complaints range from lack of characterization weak narrative poor direction of actors the dated style and too much focus over special effects still film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism much of which the average film buff does not care for hence this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films even with the improvements in the special editions there are many memorable sequences throughout the film ranging from the fast and furious pod race sequence which is a take on the chariot races in ben hur and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail no matter how many times you watch this film you will catch something new the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks who belongs to a race known as the gungans best described as an mr bean from the planet naboo he steals the show unfortunately being that he is a computer generated character tells a bit about the direction of the actors although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker with star wars mania at an all time high there is the risk that the film will disappoint i myself had my doubts which this film does have a tendency to do at times there are a few logic problems with the plot several things are left unchecked and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs that and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character coming off as a smarmy arrogant brat with such an attitude it s no wonder why he turns to the dark side still it seems that many people especially critics are missing the point the film is some of the most fun and a half hours that you ll blow in your life which is something i wouldn t mind doing again while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender who really cares the film is pure fun from beginning to end and isn t that what really matters 
based on the boris karloff s classic by the same name the mummy starts off with the high priest of osiris imhotep who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible bandaged up having his tongue removed and being covered in flesh eating scarab beetles then entombed all while still alive recap a few thousand years later where a soldier named rick played by brandan fraser aids a young historian named evelyn played by rachel wiesz and her brother jonathan played by john hannah in finding the book of amon ra in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress using evelyn as a sacrifice walking in with relatively low expectations i thought this movie was actually pretty good the visuals and cgi are astounding and obviously not cheaply done at all they pack a ton of detail into the images especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes such as unnerving moments involving flesh eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him after all those who took his artifacts are cursed unfortunately the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time becoming a tug of war for control between genres on one hand it is a fast paced action film on the other it s a frightening horror film and on the side it s a hilarious comedy ideally for it to be successful the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect with one character serving as the comic relief that would be johnson the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief with rick occasionally delivering his witty one liner if they were trying to make a horror action comedy it would have helped if it were established early on in the film but unfortunately with the backstory of imhotep s entombment that would be impossible and then there s the slapstick fight scene between a sword wielding rick and an army of mummies while really well done it had the feel of slapstick comedy replace the sword with a chainsaw and you d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness while entertaining and funny it feels really out of place but at least it s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of on the whole the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end entertaining the audience but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners turn the sound down while a lot of theatres have good sound systems my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you re not careful when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film end of days it was so loud i couldn t make anything out 
when bulworth ended i allowed myself a sigh of relief it is possible for me to enjoy political satire there have been several recent political films that didn t do a whole lot for me wag the dog for instance i found to be an intelligent but heartless film while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness bulworth is a far better film than these both in its execution and lasting impression it s a tremendously funny and intelligent picture but it also has an emotional center writer director star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character and in turn we like him and actually care about the story beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again he hasn t slept in days nor has he eaten and almost instantaneously he goes insane he s not stark raving mad not outright anyway but he s definitely bonkers it s the final weekend of his campaign and his assistant murphy oliver platt has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto bulworth begins the speech but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest you mean one lady asks the democratic party doesn t care about the african american community well he shouts laughing isn t that obvious the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life he muses later that it s a bad thing to make decisions when you re suicidal he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses graham beckel whom he believes to be the hitman bulworth also meets nina halle berry with whom he becomes infatuated suddenly in the short span of this weekend bulworth s no nonsense truth in politics methods become a national sensation and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences beatty s work on both sides of the camera is excellent his script and direction are both extremely sharp as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself here is a man who s reached his limit and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure i like that the film doesn t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich although the anti rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film some of the segments are simply hilarious such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him much of the film is completely absurd but that s the fun part about it it s an angry serious film at the core but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre what adds to this feeling is beatty s portrayal of bulworth this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale beatty is so much fun to watch here he s always funny but he s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions beatty is so good that bulworth despite his shortcomings as a human being is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning the supporting cast is vast and colorful berry is luminous as always and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun toting toddlers to do his dirty work oliver platt is an actor who should be careful for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting though he s very funny to watch paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections is bulworth offensive i suppose some may see it that way i wasn t offended by the film but then again i hardly care about politics i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story the film isn t perfect of course the ending didn t quite work for me and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film bulworth is a smart uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface 
written by john grisham and robert altman as al hayes directed by robert altman some time ago a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel the novel was a summer smash topping best seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads the only problem the novel wasn t very good it was far more pulp than pulitzer but the director realized that no matter how pedestrian the prose this book really grabbed people that the author while not a great writer was a fantastic storyteller so he took on the project convinced he could make something happen on screen the director francis ford coppola the book of course was mario puzo s the godfather the rest as they say in showbiz was history by bringing up the godfather i don t mean to suggest that robert altman s the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material can you get any more questionable than john grisham depends on whom you ask but there s no question that grisham s work grabs people like puzo grisham is a better storyteller than a writer unlike fellow hack michael crichton who is a good idea man but who can t tell a well constructed story from a can of spam so something in grisham s unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman who at years old remains one of america s greatest living filmmakers the result is a gripping thriller that while falling short of classic cinema deserves its place in the altman canon from its opening shot to the closing credits the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch witness said opening shot we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear we roll over the hills into the town of savannah then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises pay attention boys and girls this shot was not conceived by john grisham but by altman this is what a great director can do for questionable source material the sports car belongs to rick magruder kenneth branagh the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses mallory doss embeth davidzt just as she realizes her car has been stolen driven by southern chivalry a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress magruder offers her a ride home there he learns more about mallory s life than he bargained for her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon robert duvall a ted kyzynski style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter magruder perhaps influenced by mallory s decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him is sympathetic to her plight and offers to help her get her father committed right after he sleeps with her of course this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital and for a moment all appears well but then dixon s crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup and suddenly magruder finds himself mallory and his own children in danger the cops won t lift a finger to help a liberal attorney his only allies are his faithful assistant lois daryl hannah and his bumbling private eye sidekick clyde robert downey jr if this predicament wasn t bad enough hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos altman may provide the atmosphere but branagh s performance holds the gingerbread man together an accomplished actor when he isn t directing himself in vanity productions branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness or of egotism magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it and by then it s too late as the plot unfolds magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are and life is never so bad that it can t get worse if you re familiar with altman s work you ll recognize several of his signature techniques characters are not introduced in establishing shots but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style and of course there s my favorite altman technique the obligatory nude actress shot thanks to altman here are some of the actresses i ve had the pleasure of seeing naked sally kellerman julianne moore madeline stowe even frances mcdormand and now i can add embeth davidtz who looks quite healthy in the altogether the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film is it old school sexism or a clever in joke you be the judge but back to the picture at hand in the hands of a mere mortal the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller no better or worse than the countless others we ve all endured in the hands of a master like altman it becomes an exercise in existential doom in its own way far more successful than scorsese s cape fear remake which tried for the same result what may prevent it from enduring with altman s greatest work is a weak third act in fact there really is no third act in grisham s story so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up but there are true moments of riveting suspense and great performances by branagh davidzt and downey jr more than enough to see you through that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill and that my friends should make you very afraid 
in some regards making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it try too hard and it snaps but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther in simon birch director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique he takes advantage of caution and poise but also risks his movie with a few bold steps in the end he s not only holding an unbroken band but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature there s no doubt about it the film that johnson has crafted is rich he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown maine leaves turn bright orange in the fall the grass is a lush green pure white snow falls in the winter and the sky goes on forever the characters continue that turn our two leads are simon birch ian michael smith and joe wenteworth joseph mazzello simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital and by age twelve he s only two feet tall joe is the bastard son of rebecca ashley judd and by age twelve he s ready to know who is father is naturally the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith simon birch is convinced that he s god s instrument and there must be a reason he s so small joe doesn t quite buy it but he sticks by simon the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other s only true friends early on the two meet up with ben goodrich oliver platt rebecca s new boyfriend and although the bond isn t immediate ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon a testament to the acting jobs of both finally jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show mark steven johnson s sense of drama and writing is fantastic the script is loosely based on john irving s novel a prayer for owen meany but it s so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from based on to suggested by along those same lines it s almost unfitting to compare the two johnson uses tension humor atmosphere and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity gump made over million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks but the winning idea remains the same simon birch is a different look at a different life and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come in the present however it s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at 
blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood s premier leading men blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well although at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie the ideas behind blade are good as is the basic plot of the story but at times things seem to get a bit muddled and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once that really doesn t take away from the story too much but it does hurt it a little bit blade snipes is half man half vampire his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother but this isn t as easy as it seems because the vampires in blade s world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires where do vampires get money well in blade they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea and a great addition to the movie blade runs up against the evil deacon frost stephen dorff a maverick in the vampire community he isn t content to live among humans and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all powerful vampire rendering him virtually unstoppable it s up to blade to see that this doesn t transpire admittedly blade is style over substance through and through the story is a relatively forgettable one but it is fun none the less the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type this isn t a film that is going to win accolades for its performances and the actors know this the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise it s a popcorn movie and no one involved has any illusions otherwise blade s production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done although the mtv style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life very cool 
this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff s play hospitality suite its about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention whose chicago company has sent them to wichita where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the th floor of the hotel where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of a big industrial corporation he is someone they have never met before but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account it is their only reason for coming to the convention the big kahuna revels in salesmen talk among the three white christian males two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesmen having teamed together for the last twelve years while bob facinelli is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what comes into question is their opinions on life and death on god and morality and on how they make a living these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical following in the long tradition of salesmen films from death of a salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying to see why he s on top and why they are chasing after him what makes this film different than the others is its blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do as both must sell their product and how after each one s psyche is stripped clean by the other there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in bob is a baptist who takes a very non questioning and literal attitude about religion to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin according to the way he reads the bible when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and can t even say because he loves her only that marriage is something sacred to him the contrast in their personalities is stark larry is all business he simply wants to close the sale he comes into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such a small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burned out he tells him to go on a vacation get a woman while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change now that he is and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in he has always been a charmer shaking everyone s hand trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale larry is more aggressive as a salesman he is always a heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller doesn t arrive at the party the salesmen throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act as the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend larry and phil can t fathom how bob didn t make a sales pitch but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller s attention about their company s product as they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives these three performers were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with a marvelous performance the only problem with the film is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see 
alchemy is steeped in shades of blue kieslowski s blue that is with its examination of death isolation character restoration and recovery from loss suzanne myers new independent film echoes the polish director s internationally acclaimed release language aside the principal difference between the films is that while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character s world alchemy keeps its viewers at arm s length as a result while we re able to appreciate the film s intellectual tapestry it is emotionally distant alchemy is divided into three chapters charity faith and hope while there are common themes and story elements running through all three the single constant is the main character a sculptor russian translator named louisa rya kihlstedt when the film opens she s living with her painter boyfriend whom she believes to be cheating on her following his sudden death in an automobile accident louisa s life is thrown into turmoil events swirls around her and she can t find a source of stability in her quest to make sense out of her loss she befriends her late boyfriend s mistress visits her ill sister and eventually abandons her old life by joining a back to nature cult alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process the meaning of love and the nature of art does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life with all of its various distractions to the fullest myers challenge is to make these subjects art film staples engrossing in a new context through louisa s struggles she succeeds while alchemy isn t always emotionally appealing it never loses its fascination even when we re not connecting with louisa who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully developed personality there s enough material on screen to hold our attention the cinematography is stunning city scenes are tinted with blue adding a cold bleak dimension to the film s early portions later when louisa reaches the wilderness we re treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor brightly colored leaves in the trees and on the ground it s a startling but effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa s life as she travels the road back to emotional stability the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith healers who use alchemy to provide for the needs of the body and soul and although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine it s ultimately love and companionship not alchemy that brings solace her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life s ultimate goal even though louisa s final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character it s still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch alchemy isn t pure magic but especially during its best moments it s close 
titantic writer and director james cameron s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed epic arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises whether the film is worth it as a business proposition it seems hard to see how it can ever break even but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful if you ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure think again the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers in either case it is filmmaking at its best when we entered the press screening my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long he said no but that the time would go by so fast she d never notice the length amazingly he was right titanic is one of the few long films that doesn t suffer because of it the lush picture filmed by russell carpenter in mm opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean fortune hunter brock lovett bill paxton leads the expedition looking for the world s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship known back then as the ship of dreams the necklace s hundred year old former owner rose dewitt bukater gloria stuart finds brock to tell him her story although almost all of the movie happens in flashback one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk using a computer simulation the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing after twenty minutes the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage in a classic movie theme the two parts of the ship first class and steerage third class exist in sharp contrast the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance cal hockley played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class even with her own promenade deck rose feels trapped on the ship what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes in contrast jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board after jack saves rose from committing suicide they start a brief but impassioned love affair never tawdry and rarely explicit their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma in so many ways small and large he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part when he confronts cal for example he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal s supercilious put downs kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose the chemistry between these two academy award nominees him for what s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility is nothing short of astonishing from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances if the film breaks after an hour and a half which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up you will still get one of the best films of the year peter lamont s sets are more than authentic one scene for example starts with the planning to retire captain played with insouciance by bernard hill having his tea on deck it then shifts to the ship s massive gears and then to the bright hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest at first since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull not some big gaping hole the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else what a lark we ve struck an iceberg now let s get back to our brandy and cigars the ship s musicians play like troopers through it all even after the panic sets in after all they see it as their duty to calm the passengers when the musicians are about to die they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together and they mean it their civility borders on insanity but it is touching nevertheless the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface there are more than enough characters to love and to hate and all of the casting is dead on special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable in titanic for which he created a nine tenths scale model of the entire ship cameron strove for accuracy at all costs the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two and the front section becomes vertical in the water people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately besides being romantic and dramatic the script includes liberal doses of humor from the many deliciously subtle verbal put downs to the physical comedy as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears it s good bye for a little while a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first this boat s for mommies and children there ll be a boat in a little while for daddies basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats it made the decks look too crowded otherwise perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim s on board the ship in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew no thanks the elegantly attired guggenheim replies we re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen but we would like a brandy titanic runs it is rated pg for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up 
i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set unless i m watching a movie i don t even have cable so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching the x files every sunday night it s the only show that s worth an hour of my time each week though since i don t watch reruns i m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether i am an avid fan of the show and have been for about three years now and i love gillian anderson the x files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off the film is like a two hour episode except that there are a lot more special effects the plot is thicker and the resolution is more satisfying this is a terrific film both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment i expected to like it more than any episode i ve seen and my expectations were met actually the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices but thankfully the makers managed to do it right when the finale ended the fbi branch known as the x files had been destroyed and our heroes mulder david duchovny and scully gillian anderson were left stripped of five years of hard work the film picks up soon after and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building but wait i m getting ahead of myself the film actually opens in the ice age about years prior during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien the alien s blood infects them fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer and the story jumps into modern times during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy and mulder and scully uncover the cover up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi soon they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens as i ve written before it s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this because everything needs to be a surprise fans of the show will know what to expect and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television there are some truly suspenseful and well created scenes here late in the film when they re in the alien spacecraft you ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema the special effects are very good and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic what i find interesting is that the x files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story our heroes are given subtle introductions we re not expected to know them on the outset and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn t required to understand the film there are of course little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans but i ll keep those as surprises it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly the series is strong for a lot of reasons it s original though it has many ties to the twilight zone and owes some homage to hitchcock and impressively eerie for a television show what really makes the series shine however are the actors duchovny has so much presence and is just a fun guy to watch he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man anderson is equally good and paralyzingly beautiful she s also a strong actress both performers have acted in little more than their series however though i think they ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon i enthusiastically recommend the x files both for fans and non fans is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry it s an intelligent film and takes you places that you might not have been or at least might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar the x files is impressive in concept as well fans of the series are likely to be highly critical and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move it s nice to see a risk pay off for a change actually it s nice to see a risk at all 
plot odin is a great high school basketball player he s dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass in fact the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him unfortunately the coach s real son hugo isn t too pleased to hear that in fact he doesn t like hearing about any of odin s triumphs as they generally supersede his own so what does he set out to do well let s just say that he starts to mess with people s heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to well you ll see critique a very powerful thoroughly depressing well acted non teen movie starring a bunch of teens credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic set in a realistic high school environment with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film who turn over some very convincing performances taking you through all of their characters ups and downs hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of sign of a good actor if you ask me phifer also comes to play in this movie with a nice blend of charisma fear love and anger spread over his character i was always on this guy s side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along julia stiles was also good but her character wasn t much different from others that she s played recently i was however very surprised with martin sheen s showing since i hadn t taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years his character is definitely over the top in this film but i appreciated his fervor his rage his ultimate and blind desire to win above all a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest i did have a few reservations about the movie though first of all what was with all of the gangsta hip hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition it was cute at first but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times the film was also edited pretty choppily like some scenes were cut out and no one cleaned it up afterwards i also didn t like the fact that hartnett s character the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film was infallible in other words pretty much everything he says or asks of someone happens automatically and without any goofups i mean i know the guy is smart and all but i would have appreciated a little more realism under some of the circumstances but overall the movie will devastate you it s not a fun date movie it s not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks it s about jealousy love envy fury passion revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that s ever passed through your head is it worth seeing oh most definitely pun intended it s a moving picture with great performances no shakespearian speak thank you god and an outstanding directorial job by nelson the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine and i was especially impressed with the director s choice of music near the end in fact the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver and i guess that s saying something right there where s joblo coming from things i hate about you election hamlet love s labor s lost natural born killers save the last dance shakespeare in love 
warning this review contains some spoilers for the film fail safe if you haven t seen the film yet proceed with caution nutshell a relevant intelligent suspenseful drama still powerful today even after the end of the cold war fail safe usa drama minutes screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e youngstein directed by sidney lumet review by jamahl epsicokhan the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn t have a winning side and a losing side in a nuclear confrontation everybody loses and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world assuming the world survives the idea and perhaps the only real option is to avoid war at all costs this is the theme of sidney lumet s fail safe a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler fail safe takes place during the heart of the cold war the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word communism the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws five u s bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers suddenly out of contact and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives the bomber pilots cannot be recalled and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike a great deal of fail safe s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u s bombers from reaching russia s borders at any cost the plot is compelling and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails general bogan frank overton taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself henry fonda is powerless the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated pre programmed system that may not be stoppable simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no win situation winnable the events in fail safe are fascinating because they re anything but predictable but the real reason fail safe works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war communism the cold war and the united states role in all of it most of this is through the film s use of the character groeteschele walter matthau an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who incidentally is on the president s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war many of the film s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices early in the film he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of strategy in a nuclear assault to minimize casualties what s the difference between million and million dead a guest asks impatiently forty million groeteschele responds wryly the problem with groeteschele s mindset is that he believes nuclear combat to be a viable method of war the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off as general black dan o herlihy has often recommended on the contrary according to groeteschele that would lead to russia having more nuclear weapons than the u s which would clearly put america at a disadvantage such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race fail safe clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war and likewise it becomes a central theme in the film why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over is it wise is it even logical no not really although fail safe is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial one sided sort of way again this is achieved through groeteschele who is easily the film s most important character in terms of the larger theme significance in addition to providing the central pro nuclear war voice that the film warns against he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib one of groeteschele s logical trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it s merely absurd he labels the average marxist an unfeeling calculating machine that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u s drops the warhead on moscow the soviets will instantly surrender for to retaliate would invite counter measures that would further destroy russia s home soil which must be preserved at all costs groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge as any normal person would the irony here is groeteschele s own mechanical theorizing he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns once the film makes it evident that turning the u s bombers will be impossible the question becomes what the consequences of destroying moscow will be just how will the soviet union s leader react and what can the president do to convey his best intentions just how does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an mishap with the help of his translator buck larry hagman the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity with lumet s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader without getting into too much detail i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances that is as sensible as a nuclear incident can probably be it does accomplish what it must it avoids an all out war something that simply isn t possible because of its all too real consequences dramatically the ending is quite powerful and the use of o herlihy s character as the symbolic matador providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film s opening is particularly appropriate fail safe is a production of a major hollywood studio released by columbia pictures and it has the structure of a high tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film nevertheless under lumet s direction and walter bernstein s intelligent adaptation of burdick s and wheeler s novel the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming but it was the conscious human choice to initialize this automatic arming that fail safe also finds dangerous in retrospect the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century it s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down rather than continuing groeteschele s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown 
i have to say it tim burton s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys ok that s off my chest no more monkey puns i promise seriously though planet of the apes is one rip roarin summer outing filled with thrills action adventure wit and bits of funny dare i say monkey business i know i know i promised and for those film buffs who are fond of the original burton s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie mark wahlberg stars as capt leo davidson a deep space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted captured and sold into slavery despite being darker than the original burton s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious some of the movie s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton an organ grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty one thing you don t want in your house is a human teen ager he says you don t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton s brand lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian s foot to try righting himself are take your stinking hand off of me you damned dirty human anyone familiar with the first version of the film will of course recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue another of burton s in jokes is to have charlton heston star of the original play the chimpanzee father of tim roth s gen thade the young chimp goes to visit his dying father both have one thing in common a hatred of humans with his dying breath the elder spews out his vile damn them damn them all to hell he says before expiring that is the famous line heston s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet s terrible secret the performances throughout are top notch wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung ho hero but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion his only objective being to find a way off this upside down planet this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable roth is ferocious cunning cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet it is a masterful turn helena bonham carter is ari the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals hers is a smart compassionate characterization michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures as the battle between apes and humans looms the cowardly limbo pleads can t we all just get along echoing the words of rodney king much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton s technical crew especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup burton s musical collaborator danny elfman provides another fine score though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow the movie s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the original he comes close but falls short otherwise planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be an amusement park ride filled with lots of action stunts and a few laughs this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre release hype 
it was with great trepidation that i approached mary the farrelly brothers latest film i knew the film would be funny the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see but i also knew the film would be an equal opportunity offender attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon i figured the film would be raunchy maybe another lucky escapee from nc hell i may laugh but would i feel better in the morning i needn t have worried mary is the sweetest warmest all out laugh and grossfest this side of animal house surprisingly the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers they make laughter the toughest job for a filmmaker to do look easy the plot is typical thirteen years ago geeky ted ben stiller lucked out in having dazzling mary cameron diaz go with him to the senior prom as luck would have it on that very day he was hospitalized why i shall not tell but i assure you it isn t pretty he hires a private investigator to find her pat healy matt dillon he becomes one of the great comic villains upon finding her he too is lovestruck and so pursues her lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double crossed and goes to get her for himself would the geek get the girl puh lease the ending is pure hollywood no surprises there but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers hair gel the mentally disabled the physically handicapped interracial marriages homosexuals skin conditions serial killers tanning and drugged up dogs the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame and yet for all the targets that are hit the film maintains its sweet tone mary playing the straight role is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother warren w earl brown miles away from the cameraman in scream mary s sunniness carries the film here it compliments the below belt gags that come at you cameron diaz makes her totally charming and the audience respects her even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window ben stiller also fares very well totally changing his image from his reality bites and flirting with disaster straight men to being a how to say it a complete loser braces greasy long hair not too bright and very very funny dillon is exceptionally creepy especially with his capped teeth and rounding out the cast is ted s friend dom chris elliot tanning addict magda lin shaye modern troubador greek chorus ron lichman and mary s sweet mom markie post where has she been not everything works chris elliot s role skin blemishes and all becomes merely tasteless and boring there s lousy dialogue about eight minute vs seven minute exercise tapes and there are long stretches without much going on but the wait is worth it when those extraordinary sequences hit the entire theater erupted with howls tears belly aches that in some sequences carried over to the following scene the farrelly brothers have finally done it yes there are some raunchy bits but when it is all over it s not nearly as bad as it could have been while tasteless it didn t cross any lines at least not with me while raunchy it wasn t nearly as bad as porky s or boogie nights and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick after the funny but sour kingpin left a negative aftertaste in my palate comes the funniest sex farce since a fish called wanda approach this with an open mind and you will reap the benefits hugely 
in my review of there s something about mary i said something to the effect of laughter isn t everything i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate laughter isn t everything unless i m watching a jim abrahams film see spoofs are easy with me i love movies and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love sometimes i m the only one in the theater laughing sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high pitched in comparison to my speaking voice it cuts right through everyone else s laughter sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film abraham s latest film mafia induced this kind of hysteria upon me it s gotten some mediocre reviews but hey i m the guy who laughs at everything there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film but there are far more that work and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought provoking most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things like develop characters shape stories and other such nonsense mafia has no pretentions about characters or story and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh the film begins on the perfect high note with a mockery of the opening of casino our hero jay mohr is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire to describe the story of mafia is absurd and pointless but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films with a lot of casino references inserted throughout along the way the parodies seem arbitrary and rarely victimize mob films pictures like the english patient forrest gump and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing movies like this rely on just a few things but the most important element is direction abrahams has been down this path many times before hot shots top secret airplane and any other film with an exclamation point in the title and so i hold most of the success of mafia to his experience he takes just the right attitude in each scene and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic but it never develops the actors are all energetic which helps a lot with the tone of the film mohr suicide kings paulie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors is so good here he looks like he s having so much fun that he s containing his laughter in every scene watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool he s probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando s godfather while pamela gidley is dead on in a full blown mockery of sharon stone the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i m supposed to give examples of things and be specific unfortunately i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia that i can t remember a lot of what made me laugh but that s a good sign mafia is so funny that i wasn t even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain i know that doesn t sound particularly complimentary but when watching a dumb comedy like this the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain finally a film that does this for me 
 jaws is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen the movie opens with blackness and only distant alien like underwater sounds then it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score dah dum from there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip perhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie he works it like a theatrical production with a first act and a second act unlike so many modern filmmakers he has a great deal of restraint and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act until then he merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music he s building the tension bit by bit so when it comes time for the climax the shark s arrival is truly terrifying he doesn t let us get bored with the imagery the first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider a new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn t been a murder or a gun fired in years the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesn t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money brody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfuss a young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark it s a perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying when vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaws is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror it is like ten movies all rolled into one and it s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in by star wars even today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock s psycho and it never seems to age although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill the technical limitations faced by spielberg in may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects scheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman nevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what s right and going against the entire town it s your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him dreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz gives a surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers however most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie s captain ahab a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards bordering of parody shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism he s slightly deranged and shaw s performance is almost a caricature however there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u s s indianapolis a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen shaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film of course we can t leave out the shark itself with its black eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankind s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are a threat every one of spielberg s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark a bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into the shark in jaws was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angles many have forgotten but jaws was a sort of precursor to waterworld a movie s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb but as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood 
contrary to the title the boxer is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics it s actually three movies in one a political film a boxing film and a love story all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal we ve seen it all before and we re just not blown away with it like we should be oh well it s still an excellent irish story the boxer of the title is danny flynn jim sheridan staple daniel day lewis an ex ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after years and finds out that his troubles are far from over first off the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill brian cox and one of its sub leaders harry gerard mcsorley both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail while this is going on danny and his old drunkard buddie ike ken stott who played the chief inspector in danny boyle s shallow grave re open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects protestant and catholics to work together danny not only begins teaching kids how to box but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison and is ready to start boxing real people again and danny runs into his ex love maggie breaking the waves s emily watson who hasn t seen him since he went in they don t easily start up their romance again because she s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny s tenure in prison and also has a son liam ciaran fitzgerald from him whom liam is hoping will get out soon but the two are slowly re drawn to eachother again and this begins to complicate things the political story is nothing really special but works in itself we ve seen it many a time before but it s at least interesting sometimes emotional and even riveting at times there s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty the boxing story is very minor to the story but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly and even with good sportsmanship there are only a few boxing scenes but they re never like raging bull let s strip down the sport to its bones brilliant they re more realistic and instead of bone crunching we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother which is slightly unerving at times and i didn t know daniel day lewis was in such good shape but the backbone of the story is the love one because these characters are given such horrible circumstances and since the two leads have such great chemistry together we really feel for their plight as the film goes on and circumstances get worse and worse the characters have to make real human decisions and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters this is how you write a love story take note hollywood these elements are pretty much equally balanced with each of the parts of the stories working hand in hand with eachother i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered and sometimes spilled over into the next it made sure that we didn t just care for one of them i m not saying they re all equally great because the love story really carries the film but at least they all work out respectively the acting is amazing with day lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry i m not sure if they re oscar nominee bound but they re very good in the supporting roles billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike who is just a great scene stealer the direction and co writing by jim sheridan with the other co writing credit going to terry george is excellent rounding out the characters well but not pacing everything greatly i noticed that the first half was very leisurely yet fascinating but the second half whirls by at a quick pace and ends much too quickly more time could have been spent thinking up the ending since it does seem quite sloppy though the boxer is a good film it never achieves the greatness that it should sure it s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get but on it s own it just could have been better but it still works out gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama and features great acting even if it could have been better this ll do 
john sayles men with guns is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power the film takes place in an unnamed central american country where the men with guns are the rulers most of the country is divided into tiny segments some are controlled by guerrillas with guns some are controlled by army soldiers with guns and all the spaces in between are controlled by thieves bandits and terrorists all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness however like so many central american countries this one also features modernity there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization skyscrapers hospitals televisions highways etc but it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land or else they are simply ignorant of it the film s main character dr fuentes federico luppi falls into the latter category one of his patients an army general describes him as the most educated man he has ever met and also the most naive fuentes is a true liberal a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians with government assistance he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate this program was to be his legacy and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea however when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot g s he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned as he travels deeper into the forest going from village to village the story is always the same the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers usually for helping the other when dr fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors she replies simply because they had guns and we didn t rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power dr fuentes picks up several companions during his journey all of whom are characterized by their loss first there is a young boy named conejo dan rivera gonz lez who has neither a mother nor a father next fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo dami n delgado who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities through his ordeal in the army domingo has lost most of his self respect and defines himself only by his pistol along the way the group also picks up padre portillo dami n alc zar a priest who has lost his faith as domingo is running from the army so is portillo he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer and ran away from the village in which he was preaching last the group takes on a mute girl named graciela tania cruz who hasn t spoken since she was raped two years earlier her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her sayles two major strengths as a director characters and setting are abundantly evident in men with guns like many of his films sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room but a longer than necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor he creates fascinating complex characters especially dr fuentes and domingo their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film s overarching theme of violence as power domingo s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded at first it is but later is isn t the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself sayles knows how to bring a location to life whether it be an early twentieth century coal mining town in matewan or a contemporary texas mexico bordertown in lone star sayles is not a particularly inventive director he likes to let his actors do most of the work but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak gattaca successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico using all latin american actors and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border it would not be a stretch to say that men with guns is a depressing film in fact the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure in addition to loss the main characters are also failures at something whether that be dr fuentes failure to change anything through medicine or padre portillo s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being nevertheless it is bleak material sayles has chosen and he deals with it accordingly the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope even in a world where as one character puts it nobody refuses the men with guns 
underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today s hope floats was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year we always get films that make big money at the box office but critics and audiences pan on them this year double jeopardy is one of those films critics are calling it predictable and worthless audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment but as i viewed double jeopardy i found that it was a great movie it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart along with heart pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons a woman with a seemingly normal life a great loving husband a beautiful son and a great friend her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her however she isn t immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money she pleads not guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad which makes libby s heart stop right there she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn t dead one of her cell mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones he is a man who has had his share of bad things while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband leading up to some jaw dropping twists that are both predictable and not whatever happens the film was excellent to me i found the writing well written as well as the acting was great ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie even if you know what is going to happen in the end you don t know how this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen except you don t know how they are going to make it happen it could be one way or another it could be this way or that way the movie is highly stylized and extremely well made it gets most of it s power from the two leads ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances the characters are well realized and believable and we feel libby s pain when she cannot see her child for years even though a lot of critics didn t like the film i loved it the director took his time making the movie and put a lot of shadowing in the movie i found it not to be boring at all and it s only flaw comes from some predictability it moved at a fast pace has suspense humor heart and great acting it earns it s right to be a great movie and to me that s what it was 
glory starring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freeman is the true story of the th regiment of massachusetts the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war broderick plays robert gould shaw the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle shaw the son of well to do abolitionists hailed from boston high society the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory as the film begins in shaw is a captain in the northern forces like private eriksson michael j fox in casualties of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war that is until his company is attacked by enemy forces shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck soon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort glory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery the film periodically jumps between shaw s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action the large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth he is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight his bitter tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability washington provides much of the film s intensity and emotional power in one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave it makes your blood boil the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings a tear rolls down washington s cheek and will probably run down your cheek as well the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn t deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores freeman is as usual a strong presence even in a small supporting role he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers colonel shaw recognizes freeman s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major making him the first black officer in the army andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles a free black who is one of shaw s close childhood friends searles is educated and refined like a white man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships but somehow they never lose their morale the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens subjecting them to racism and discrimination they are paid only a month whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen and for a long time they have to go without shoes guns or uniforms to make matters worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor eventually however the regiment receives its boots uniforms rifles and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it means threatening a general with blackmail broderick in fact is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment unfortunately however broderick s uneven performance is in many respects the weak link in the movie in an effort to look more mature broderick sports a mustache and a goatee and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced the film places too much weight on broderick s character and not enough on the black soldiers who are more intriguing glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head the film for the most part leaves the gore to your imagination which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid to the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying it s just that director edward zwick the co creator of thirtysomething films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers the movie depicts some of but not enough of their customs and rituals in one scene for example the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration a couple of the movie s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe disbelief and pride the regiment s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner like any war film glory has its share of gloom and despair but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say or more precisely what they do not say blacks played a critically important role in the north s victory over the south forever changing the evolution of america 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned all the world s a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts excerpt from as you like it act ii scene when william shakespeare penned this passage he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash this is the world of today and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high concept project like the truman show truman burbank jim carrey seems to have the perfect life he has a pretty doting wife meryl laura linney a comfortable insurance sales position an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven a reliable childhood buddy marlon noah emmerich except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia this is paradise or so it would seem bizarre inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman s life a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term isolated follows him around a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move for the first time in his life it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be the truman show directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol is a remarkably well constructed film paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next balancing drama with humour thoughtfulness with abandon this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy in many ways mr niccol s screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity with pivotal character defining moments occurring at sea although the film s rather conventional climax doesn t sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two thirds and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film it remains foremost a finely crafted piece of entertainment constantly light and accessible the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude and as the carefully stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable crowdpleasing underdog vs the system formula while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept some elements are lacking the device of mysterious lauren sylvia natascha mcelhone as a contributing impetus to truman s growing awareness isn t exactly convincing there s not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ed harris with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film in fact although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman s artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even more deeply in the insulatory seahaven world with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling still the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city i ve always believed that the versatile ms linney possesses a tremendous comic gift she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character mischievously flashing a glazed insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans cheerfully going over the top it s hilarious to watch her who would have ever guessed that she d have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ms linney is a delight in the film but it is mr carrey who rules the show here he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal it s difficult not to root for truman in a commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint there s an early scene where he s down on his knees gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey to pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gags it s almost poetic how this notorious look at me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who s constantly the centre of attention in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman s antiseptic white picket fenced smalltown utopia and by burkhard dallwitz s original score technical credits are first rate all around while the truman show is clearly a definitive high concept film it s not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound ranging from s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british tv series the prisoner all the same this is a visionary award calibre film entertaining provocative and intelligent the curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film s concept seems unfathomably outrageous it s abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such a scenario perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world 
in an insider s look at a scandal ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination closely based on clinton s campaign was written anonymously former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship now the book primary colors has been made into a movie directed by mike nichols and in light of recent presidential scandals seems to be more relevant than ever but the film is more than a diatribe against or a paean in praise of the president it is a fascinating look at the political machinery and the ethical quagmire that surround modern politics jack stanton john travolta is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination he is charismatic but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign and strains his relationship with his wife susan emma thompson the film is told from the point of view of henry burton adrian lester grandson of a civil rights leader who is swept away by stanton s ideals and helps to organize the campaign he joins political strategist richard jemmons billy bob thornton looking an awful lot like james carville and campaign advisor daisy green maura tierney governor stanton s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him a fact that his chief rival lawrence harris kevin cooney consistently uses to his advantage to help clean up the stanton campaign jack and susan bring in an old friend libby the dustbuster holden kathy bates the acting throughout primary colors is superb it would be worth seeing the movie for bates wild performance alone she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton although his accent does stray a little emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom primary colors treads lightly on this issue though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans the movie touches on few actual political issues in fact most of the bad guys are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house rather than issues the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control although the film strays into some obviously non clinton territory it is difficult to completely separate it from reality particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president s current troubles primary colors chief problem is its length it runs about minutes too long there are some scenes which could have easily been cut for example midway through the film the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists the scene s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton s character which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film the extra length isn t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying but it mars an otherwise excellent film republicans democrats and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors it s a funny and at some times shocking look at the modern political process 
with the release of gattaca i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens or aliens in general hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films but what was usually lacking was a good story and good characters and good acting etc contact being the exception and for some reason hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth the closest that i have seen anyway was a space odyssey which made mankind an alien race themselves being dwarfed by the technology which they created now comes gattaca another film about technology reigning supreme except here on our planet the difference between and this one is simple gattaca is more frightening most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering using this premise writer director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills unfortunately due to a lack of advertising i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office since seeing the film i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca lately however i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca most people don t even realize that it is a film despite this fact i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it niccol s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter better produced and more realistic gattaca begins in the st century procreating is now done in a petri dish and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it natural child birth is considered old fashioned we are introduced to jerome morrow ethan hawke an employee of the gattaca space program one of the directors of the program has been murdered and the main suspect is one vincent freeman the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love however after his birth and through several genetic tests doctors tell his parents that he will have a chance of a weak heart as well as poor eye sight and a short life span as a result both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics anton loren dean is produced without flaws and the competition between brothers spawns vincent has a dream to fly a solo flight around the titan the th moon of saturn but because of his condition gattaca and society in general forces him to do menial labor around the company labeled an in valid vincent s dream seems impossible until he meets a black market dna specialist german tony shalhoub german introduces him to a valid who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident jerome morrow jude law agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools urine blood skin and hair samples etc that he will need to get past gattaca s tight security in exchange vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship after the murder however his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime irene cassini uma thurman is a genetically flawed valid working for gattaca and she begins to fall in love with vincent jerome gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years contact and the arrival and gattaca will rank among them unfortunately whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects laden films it normally gets buried the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs the orange glow of gattaca s scenes are impressive but the sets deserve most of the credit the sets are very well done creating a futuristic sense but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers as we look at the designs we realize that these buildings aren t too far into the future this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day the best thing however is the plot the story is more than your average sci fi thriller at its heart it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies maybe human nature is a result of mankind s flaws if we get rid of flaws do we get rid of dreams as well niccol s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story or vice versa the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol s part it actually enhances the meaning behind the story ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor giving his best performance of his lifetime so far his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and valid peers uma thurman is well uma thurman her character is slightly underdeveloped but the story isn t about her however thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character he provides several nice touches and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one loren dean gives a nice performance in his well developed character dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank still he does a good job gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film gattaca is rated pg for brief violent images language some sexuality and nudity despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film i wasn t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty it turned me off slightly but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have if this had been a typical hollywood film it would have ended much differently however with all the mindless science fiction films out there it is nice to have a film which doesn t talk down to its audience i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding g t c and a instead it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want a science fiction film with morals behind it whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca and hopefully audiences will too p s personal note to p j gladnick how dare you call this film the worst film of the year i can t even begin to image what film you do like that frightens me beyond anything 
when i first heard that disney s next animated feature was going to be tarzan i was almost horrified i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules sorry jerk ules that effort was too overloaded with comedy and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero and after viewing it to this day i find it a disgrace for disney animation when i saw the trailers i was thinking hmm this isn t bad at all this just might have potential when i bought the soundtrack i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features i have never really heard of phil collins nor have i heard of mark mancina so i was wondering how would these two make this disney flick spin i was pleasantly surprised the music is top notch phil collins songs are terrific percussion heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs the score from mark mancina was also neat it reminded me a bit of the lion king but it was more original so the soundtrack wasn t bad at all considering it was by two people i am not familiar with this film could be good but will it be when i finally went to see it on opening day as i tend to do with most disney animated features my question was answered in a complete turnabout of expectations for me disney s tarzan is surprisingly decent the story starts out with tarzan s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace however one day a vicious leopard sabor attacks and kills tarzan s parents leaving him at this time a baby alone until kala of the apes rescues him kala wants to raise the child as her own she lost hers previously to sabor but her mate kerchak is not too sure it s not our kind he says he agrees though to let her take care of little tarzan but that doesn t make him my son tarzan grows up vowing to be the best ape ever but no matter how hard he tries or what he does at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend terk he just can t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes even when he defeats sabor in a battle one day a new animal shows up humans this is where jane comes into the picture she is on an expedition with her father professor porter and a despicable hunter clayton searching for gorillas tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons and soon they get to know each other even though tarzan falls in love with jane this causes things to go wrong clayton tricks tarzan into taking him jane and porter to see the apes who are convinced that he has betrayed them worse clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes i m not gonna tell you sorry you re gonna have to see for yourself and see it you should the animation is as always top notch particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees read that skateboarding the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in in fact it seems similar to the computer imagery cel animation combination in rival disney animted films such as fox s anastasia and dreamworks prince of egypt could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals the casting is fairly good tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan and to my relief the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules nicely done and glenn close is wonderful as kala she has a beautiful singing voice too by the way lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson s beast voice which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film when i first saw the trailers but when i saw the film i didn t have a problem with her i take back my insult on driver it s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature he was fflewdurr flamm in disney s most underrated classic the black cauldron he is funny and delightful as professor porter on the villiany side of the voices brian blessed the guy who did boss nass in star wars episode i the phantom menace brings a pompous and later on vicious voice to the sinister clayton he might not be the strongest character in the film he s just a plain bad guy nothing else but blessed s vocal work contributes greatly but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show it should be rosie o donnell who is hilariously funny as terk she also has a fiesty attitude i m gonna kill ya she says more than once i almost sung along with her during one of the film s best moments where the apes make a mess of the human s camp via song er scatting shoo be doo da be dah i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film she s a good singer not that she was the only funny character in the film though wayne knight who played stan in space jam gives a whimsically funny style to tantor an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into un sanitary water thankfully there is no real sound of flatuence that would have killed the picture the songs as i said before are decent mostly sung by collins this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time the characters do not sing i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would but i found this to be a nice change of pace the story does have elements of comedy in it but they also load it with strong dramatic touches which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules if there is anything disappointing about tarzan it might be the omission of the n sync version of trashing the camp from the film i heard it on the soundtrack and wondered where it was going to be i was upset that it wasn t because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like n sync to see tarzan oh well overall i was enthralled with tarzan i wouldn t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame my all time favorite disney classics but this film deserves a high place among disney s greatest achievements i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular masterpiece mulan with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough s tarzan 
full metal jacket very much like every other hard hitting film about the vietnam war is an shocking emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man private joker played by matthew modine during his tour in the vietnam war however full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before boot camp these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning as in platoon full metal jacket gets off to a quick start the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits which is getting their heads shaved from there they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman played extremely well by the former drill instructor r lee ermey apparently the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence vincent d onofrio whom is dubbed gomer pyle by sgt hartman the film is continually narrated by private joker in which he explains his visions on what is going on the entire corps although repeatedly hammered by sgt hartman continues on private pyle however seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation and it basically does not stop that is until sgt hartman comes up with a new plan he will punish the rest of the soon to be marines for pyle s goof ups even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits and things take a turn for the worst pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally physically and mentally cut out for the life of a marine after graduation joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war which is his service he is not a member of the infantry and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat when he sets out on a documenting mission this question becomes very clear from the start joker joins up with a platoon along with his hometown friend cowboy arliss howard and follows their everyday actions interviewing and filmming them along the way he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight or die again as in the tradition of vietnam war films full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti war film or not a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam as have others in the past this film in different ways also can be viewed as more powerful than others that again is up for debate and depends on your opinion one thing is for sure however no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to unfortunately many did 
synopsis shrek myers is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad john lithgow farquaad agrees to relocate the pests on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona diaz whom farquaad desires to wed from a far off castle grudgingly shrek sets out joined in his quest by an unwanted companion donkey murphy review one memorable aspect of disney s aladdin was that it finally gave robin williams a character the genie to best take advantage of his comic talents shrek does the same for eddie murphy ironically though murphy s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass all the same shrek does represent murphy s best comic outing in years and as donkey he steals all the best lines for instance after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature donkey soars into the air and scoffs now i m a flying talking donkey and despite its many contributors the script for shrek is full of such comic gems myers is delightful in more of a straight man role and lithgow also gets some great moments watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man shrek takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain things do go somewhat astray during the film s middle segment which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie s greatest strength but even then one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology 
oliver stone s latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents it s a three hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the th century stone doesn t hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done at the same time he creates a very human character a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics which is here pictured as a wild animal he is simply trying to tame it but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president s ability to control them stone doesn t in any way apologize for nixon he blames not only nixon s own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself the system that once set in motion behaves with a mindlessness of its own nixon is a modern shakespeare story a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws there s something almost majestic about the process as nixon goes down in this film there is no gloating but a watery sigh as of a great ship sinking sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding creating a very emotional picture of the th american president joan allen s magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette she is strong and loyal as mrs nixon the rest of the cast is equally magnificent including james woods j t walsh paul sorvino ed harris and bob hoskins everyone does a serious and demanding job no one are disappointing stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy honest and determined he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon s youth and childhood the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin robert richardson s rich cinematography and john williams musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere the film s only fault is that it s a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers still it s an honest and captivating a solid piece of movie making 
what s shocking about carlito s way is how good it is having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino s previous film scent of a woman and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one he had just won an oscar carlito s way was destined for underrated heaven that s what it is an underrated gem of a movie and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study carlito s way deals with well carlito brigante pacino a puerto rican ex drug kingpin who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke addicted curly haired lawyer sean penn points out a legal technicality of course carlito was actually awoken in prison and has decided to go straight even if he s really a crook at heart carlito like barry lyndon is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn and can t escape into something he is not carlito s attempts at a clean legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn when he first gets out a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot out where he has to kill a couple people to survive he s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he s doing anything illegal and his lawyer finds himself neck deep in a pile of shit needing him to try and help him out which includes him doing some prison breaking carlito like ratso rizzo wants to go to miami since according to film logic that s where it s at but needs some funding being a legend he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club this is the s by the way and since some of this takes place in night clubs we get to hear all sorts of s classics including several k c and the sunshine band tunes my personal favorite he gets a bodyguard the great luis guzman at his best and is soon running a pretty good business even if he s constantly attracting underworld young thugs like benny blanco from the bronx john leguiziamo who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito on the other side the symbol of promise and hope is gail penelope ann miller what happened to her his girlfriend from before prison she s a goregeous ballerina and a stripper and soon carlito is trying to get back with her and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami while this relationship is never fully defined or anything we get a sense of love between them and they have some truly interesting scenes between them she never gives him addresses or locales he always has to track her down all of these elements clash together at the end in a brilliantly executed emotional climax which is inevitable when i say inevitable i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack putting a great spin on it sure it s going to eleveate some of the tension but it gives the film a lot of depth as carlito is seen trapped by fate what s amazing is the big chase sequence amazingly done by de palma has a lot of tension and thrills like apollo we know what s going to happen but we re still thrilled by what happens in the middle it s also very emotional thanks to a great script by david koepp and amazing performances by pacino and miller de palma is famous or infamous for lots of violence in his films his earlier flim scarface which starred pacino in the lead has a ton of it especially at the end and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i m still not over but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes to me the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet this is the most brilliantly done and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film and probably the best in de palma film history with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito s head and a saddened remorseful look on pacino s face it s a tear jerker well for me i dunno about you the acting from all is great especially from the three leads pacino was panned for his performance chiefly because his accent wasn t puerto rican enough and well it wasn t as strong as his oscar winning role in scent of a woman well his scent of a woman performance was great and all but it was nothing really but as comic kevin pollack said a foghorn leghorn impression in carlito s way he s emotional and strong despite the fact that he s remorseful over his entire lifestyle which he cannot change i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango dancing insult throwing blind guy in scent of a woman as i said penelope ann miller is great and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry and they re scenes are well written with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship and sean penn is amazing as the coke addicted rat attorney every scene he s in he has great energy and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino in smaller roles john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great carlito s way is one of those films which you heard about briefly but when you finally watch it you re absolutely blown away it s a wonderful film a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn t do so hot but trust me and check it out it s a great little film and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right 
after bloody clashes and independence won lumumba refused to pander to the belgians who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo their officers particularly general janssens rudi delhem in the force publique the congo s army caused rebellions undermining lumumba who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals with unrest building moise tshombe pascal nzonzi and the province of katanga which contained percent of the country s resources proclaimed secession lumumba replaced janssens making mobutu a colonel and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu maka kotto but it was too late when you want to drown a dog you say it has rabies prophesies lumumba of his own fate peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players although they frequently succumb to cliche particularly regarding lumumba s private life peck s script illuminates bantu sayings like the hand that gives rules when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador peck s direction is less assured with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare he s served well though by his casting of ebouaney in the title role ebouaney is dynamic radiating his character s fierce passion for his people and his country lumumba s intelligence and ability to strategize even as he s cornered by insurmountable odds are given life by ebouaney peck s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production lumumba is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney s performance makes the tragedy personally felt 
a movie that s been as highly built up as the truman show with reviews boasting the film of the decade and a breakthrough can only be leading up to letdown that s no doubt it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you re going in for the ride of your life that you ll end up changed on the other side and you come out of the theater going eh that s what all the fuss was about so naturally the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment and i convinced myself as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair actually to try not to enjoy it let me tell you that is an impossibilty the truman show is truly the film of the decade and a breakthrough and more and you will come out changed on the other side such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling and this friends is it jim carrey shows that he doesn t need to talk out of his butt to entertain us that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood s leading men the film has a difficult premise to tackle trying to set us up thirty years into the truman show s run but tackle it it does and perfectly with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show you get the sense that you are viewing a real prime time hit and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the real truman show is clever and well done people rejoice this is the first oscar worthy film of not only this year but of the last five years not since schindler s list has a movie captured human spirit and true despair so well this is a classic in the making and to borrow a line from esquire s review it stars jim carrey nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank mark my word for as i said this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre forget special effect ladden summer fodder drop your romantic comedies in the trash toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile you need nothing more than the truman show to carry you through the summer or for that matter the year oh and in case i don t see you good afternoon good evening and goodnight 
at one point during brian de palma s crime epic scarface the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves can t you stop saying fuck all the time fucking good question that it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride but as far as i can tell oliver stone s script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma s scarface is remembered for because this is a damn fine gangstar flick the overall structure is similar to howard hawks original but this time the scene has switched to miami florida and our anti hero s chosen vice is cocaine traffiking pacino sporting a thick cuban accent gives one the best performances of his career golden globe nominated as tony montana a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream and live it out he does with lashings of violence abuse murder and the funny white powder from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he s not a man to be fucked sorry soon he s the king of the cocaine heap but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing never do your own stash warns one character early in the film as sure as night follows day the emperor of miami eventually falls writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here stone s script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development montana is fascinating uneducated but calculating a straight shooter who speaks from the heart an ambitious violent man yet one with a conscience a man fiercely protective of his beautiful year old sister not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy dangerous world which he inhabits pacino is dynamite taking to the role with a brooding bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends and she s happy to oblige this isn t as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone s was in casino but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well as director de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations a drug deal gone wrong an assination attempt is often thrilling and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola where he differs from say coppola s godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel and it perfectly suits the material the only major botch is giorgio moroder s mostly crap synthesier score it s just not right and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes as expected scarface is very violent at times but you shouldn t be watching gangster movies if that upsets you at over two and a half hours in length it s a true epic and if you re a fan of the genre you ll love f k filled minute of it 
there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure the culture and the brotherhood of white supremacy nice guy ed norton jr who sang in everyone says i love you plays derek a twenty year old skinhead dad s subtle racism grew large in derek after gang members killed his father dad was fighting a fire when they shot him now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence at a basketball court black and white tempers flare derek channels the aggression into a game black versus white for ownership of the courts when the choice presents itself derek goes for game point instead of the sucker punch cameron stacy keach steps in to derek s life as a surrogate father he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings keeping his own criminal record spotless he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high visibility racial intimidation derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race motivated mob crimes at the bottom of the chain derek s younger brother danny edward furlong made famous in terminator joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong one night three black youths break into derek s truck which is exactly what derek has been waiting for outside in his shorts and his tattoo he shoots them all the third would be thief unarmed is only wounded in the key scene of the film derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious enraptured awful stomp the fun spoiling nc of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate considering american history x was rated r what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal ecstatic violence the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief derek does not resist the cops and as they spin him around to cuff him the film slows down derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling sadistic satisfied grin now in prison derek faces new challenges as the black man in the laundry tells him in the joint you the nigra not me there is a clique of swastika wearing skinheads but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation derek finds himself truly alone truly in danger and truly afraid when derek finally gets out of prison he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed without derek s leadership they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he s screwed up in the end he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny the film ends a little too deliberately too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film but it barely detracts from the overall experience edward norton gives an oscar worthy performance although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction norton s performance compensated an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store he also captured the essence of an older brother he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously very lovingly both before and after his change of heart though clearly not for all tastes this film is bold and daring the subject matter is ugly cruel and at times hard to look at nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity s great face kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating if distasteful american subculture 
this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers all of his movies have one main thing in common they don t skimp on the violence in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn t get shot once in the chest he gets shot many times all over the body robocop takes place in detroit in the future things are pretty bleak the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner nancy allen peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed model robot crime fighter someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off but plot twists keep it exciting the acting is bad from weller when he is human but very good when he is robocop nancy allen does a decent job this movie doesn t leave itself open for a sequel exactly but they made one anyway enter robocop starring peter weller and nancy allen directed by irvin kershner detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film ocp is trying to develop an improved robocop that will be more than a match for criminals most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over leaving robocop to be the police force in the city this film is pretty bizaare it has a year old drug lord who curses as much as eddie murphy even more violence than the original and some more humor the plot of this movie is pretty large almost too much so there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don t really match up the effects are still decent though this sequel isn t more of the same really just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals if you liked the first one watch this but be dissapointed so later comes robocop starring nancy allen and robert john burke ocp is now owned by a large japanese company robocop joins a band of rebels to counter attack the evil empire i mean ocp the japanese send a cyborg ninja to deal with robocop among other things this movie is easier to follow than the last one which means the plot isn t quite as crowded this movie isn t anything special though just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid friendly way really not reccomended 
i guess there are those who have never been kissed before a rare and dying breed except if you re child in which case it would be called experimenting rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties hardest to believe still is that drew barrymore has never been kissed despite all these hard to believe tit bits there are people out there who have never truly been kissed and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling reassuring them that their search for true love is over well this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life and it s sweet drew barrymore who shone in ever after is wonderful as josie grossy the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter it addresses the issues of how a dweeb becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting hard to believe but possible there may also be those who have been kissed before but in fact never truly been given the kiss so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it either way it is one enjoyable sit with a fairytale ending 
the farrelly brothers third film after dumb and dumber and kingpin brings together the real life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon some nasty humour a cute dog and a mix of love fate and romance plot high school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom unfortunately for ted he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ouch caught in his zipper and misses the big night thirteen years later ted still can t get mary out of his mind and hires a private detective dillon to find her once found it turns out that mary has more than one suitor and that s when the real fun begins critique likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes some funny looking people and a plot that won t ever put you to sleep having said that i must admit that i did like the farrellys two previous films more than this one but that is saying a lot since i really did love those earlier pics this one is also quite funny but it didn t really blow me away like the others then again maybe my expectations were too high then again maybe i should shut up and write a little more about the film and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking disliking the film continuing where their other pictures left off the farrellys create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities and a simple plot by which to tie them all together this one also includes plenty of toilet humour but also some borderline fun making of the disabled and mentally challenged i must admit that i really wasn t sure whether to laugh at some points or not not a good place to be having said that the scenes that did tear through the audience and yours truly were extremely hilarious and went on for several minutes after the punchline the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie something to do with hair gel on the negative end i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture i found them quite useless unfunny and distracting also i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film s trailer and of course i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful intelligent single women still can t seem to find the right guy see kiss the girls i did really like all of the actors in the film especially ben stiller who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from flirting with disaster i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth and lee evans with his superb faux sympathy british accent funny stuff also make sure that you stay for the credits because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip synched version of build me up buttercup which is really cool overall a cute comedy with a decent premise and a few particularly hilarious scenes little known facts the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script dust to dust into the hands of eddie murphy via murphy s neighbour they only found out about murphy s interest when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night matt dillon is a high school dropout in between acting gigs dillon has branched out into the restaurant business close to home in his native new york he co owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls cameron diaz stands started working as a model at the early age of and loves cats ben stiller s father is jerry stiller he played george costanza s jason alexander father on tv s seinfeld peter farrelly has written a novel entitled outside providence which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin rob moran who plays the cop in this film also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin and the bartender in dumb and dumber he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor correspondant julie moran harland williams who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film also played a state trooper in the farrelly s earlier dumb and dumber and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man 
the second jackal based film to come out in the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo s own alma matter concordia university in montreal canada the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal but does not pretend to be factual plot naval officer ramirez quinn gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal in order to put an end to the actual militant s radical activities he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this assignment and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism intrigue and double personality syndrome which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states critique great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two hour runtime admittedly i wasn t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film and didn t expect much from this movie beforehand but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line the first hour is mostly just a build up of things to come and does offer a great characterization of the jackal but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal but didn t offer anything extraordinary in my opinion sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they ve played in both of their respective careers of late but nonetheless appeared to relish the cold heartedness of their chosen characters i didn t like performance put forth from quinn s wife in this flick but then again she doesn t show up in most of the film so that wasn t so bad i did however enjoy director duguay s interesting style and cinematic vision this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer i thought that was neat having said that i didn t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the fake jackal met with the real jackal s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part but all in all not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre little known facts ben kingsley s real name is krishna banji he stands was born in scarborough england and won the best actor honor in s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal canada joblo s haven of restfulness donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland is canadian and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal 
matthew broderick and high school comedy the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in now it is years later and broderick has another high school comedy election to show the world ferris buehler s day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows it was light fluffy tasty and sparkling clean but election is far different this production is a dark and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the minutes it occupies it shocks as well jim mcallister matthew broderick is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud he is a kind caring younger man who has built his life around carver high school in turn carver high school has provided a home for him jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his year span and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body tracy flick reese witherspoon is an intelligent outgoing and to quote the film super nice young girl she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities always has her hand up first in class and is extremely popular among most of the student body so it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one the father dick holmes osborne owns a cement company the mother jo jeanine jackson is an ideal housewife and the two children paul chris klein and tammy jessica campbell are both students at carver high school paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school tammy is a lesbian who to say the least is going through a period of self discovery for reasons of revenge hatred and sexual envy jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president he claims that in a democracy you need choices and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts so paul agrees and the race is on but then in an effort to spite the two candidates tammy announces that she is running as well her campaign is straightforward people only run to put it on their college applications then they do nothing well i don t even want to go to college she says in election there are no good guys almost everyone has their own agenda no matter how deeply hidden the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school she is the girl that would be labeled most likely to achieve anything she wants in the yearbook and everyone secretly envied her because of that jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege and uses it to his own amoral advantage everyone including the principal a former teacher all the candidates and even paul s girlfriend are two sided characters that is much of this film s beauty it doesn t have the typical good guys that hollywood likes instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves matthew broderick couldn t have been any more perfect for this role his character is often similar bill murray s award winning role in the film rushmore of the two acting jobs broderick s is far superior but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her is simply indescribable broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures making her an eligible candidate and his subtle disgust with her is apparent although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part however the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so called platform for presidency she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools and gave you an innocent laugh or two then the movie achieved its goal but don t you dare think that election s goals are similar it is just as real in its portrayal of high school as its characters are in the real world there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here 
apocalypse now based on the novel hearts of darkness is an extremely striking gripping and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti war film in many ways this debate could go either way apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made in addition now film has gone to the extremes that this film does a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l willard played by martin sheen to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e kurtz a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with extreme prejudice because he has been deemed a murderer willard accepts his mission but not while pondering the accusation accusing someone of murder in this situation is like handing out speeding tickets at the indy as he puts it it doesn t make too much sense escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat the men are chef frederic forrest chief albert hall lance johnson sam bottoms and mr clean a fifteen year old laurence fishburne willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is but they all know it is something big the men encounter many exciting dangerous and bizarre situations but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf surf this is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson duvall s portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific and he provides a number of memorable quotes eventually captain willard encounters colonel kurtz s frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look especially his followers one of his main followers is a freelance photographer dennis hopper who attempts to convey the situations to willard but willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony kurtz is actually well aware of willard s mission and refers to him as an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill yet willard is intent on completing his mission no matter what shocking things kurtz does apocalypse now possibly one of the greatest films ever made is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war a movie that will hypnotize you with it s brilliant cinematography apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war definitely on the do not miss list be prepared for a very memorable film 
this has been an extraordinary year for australian films shine has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards picking up best film best actor best director etc to that we can add the gritty life the anguish courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv positive section of a jail and love and other catastrophes a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus i can t recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia shine was one bookend stand by for the other one dead heart from the opening credits the theme of division is established the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names bryan brown in a desert settlement hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby the local police officer has the task of enforcing white man s justice to the aboriginals these are people with a proud year heritage behind them naturally this includes their own system of justice key to which is payback an eye for an eye revenge usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient s thigh brown as the officer manages quite well to keep the balance he admits that he has to bend the rules a bit including actively encouraging at least one brutal payback be warned that this scene near the start is not for the squeamish the local priest an aboriginal but in the white fellas church has a foot on either side of the line he is figuratively and literally in both camps ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle he is part churchman and part politician however the tension like the heat flies and dust is always there whilst her husband the local teacher is in church white lady kate milliken and her aborginal friend tony pedersen have gone off into the hills he takes her to a sacred site even today strictly men only she appears to not know this tony tells her that this is a special place an initiation place he then makes love to her surrounded by ancient rock art the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it s payback time the fuse is lit and the brittle inter racial peace is shattered everyone is affected in the fall out to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film suffice to say it s a rewarding experience bryan brown acting and co producing is the pivotal character his officer is real human and therefore flawed brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man then suddenly feel angry about him it wasn t long ago that i visited central australia ayers rock uluru and alice springs for the first time the wide screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it s vicious beauty but never deteriorates into a moving slide show in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film from the western to the birdcage at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo saxon invaders jedda the chant of jimmie blacksmith and the last wave in a year when the race debate has reared up in australia it is nourishing to see such an intelligent non judgemental film as dead heart the aboriginal priest best sums this up he is asked to say if he is a black fella or white fella 
one of the best movies i ve ever seen i d heard extremely good things about this movie and though the previews didn t really intrigue that much it was a movie i d been anticipating for a few months now for some reason i m not sure of this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u s it was a definite hit with the critics but didn t exactly set any box office records after viewing this incredibly well directed written and acted movie i can t help but wonder why the strength of this film is it s gritty realism the main characters are all human with individual flaws no stereo type hollywood heroes you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life but that is what makes it so real i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller but i was mistaken even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase and the ending whoa i ve never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly the three male leads guy pearce kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific the best actor oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue but there is one problem there how could they have chosen between these three actors there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two it s impossible kim bassinger s performance is also a revelation i d never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was well what s the word a twinky that impression has changed as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding no cardboard characters here the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences pearce s interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant i really can t fault this movie at all i was so glad to see fellow australian s pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films but had not seen much of guy pearce i intend to change this next time i visit the video store 
with stars like sigourney weaver alien trilogy and academy award winner holly hunter the piano raising arizona etc together in a single hollywood production one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot sadly for copycat though tightly scripted and nicely plot is still at heart a typical hollywood thriller helen weaver after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer darryl harry connick jr has developed a phobia for being outdoors so to speak incidentally helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco detective monahan hunter and getz mulroney baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer seeks the professional help of helen who as expected was reluctant at first copycat borrows a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases it did work but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also much of the time wasted could ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama even so weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments weaver being the vulnerable yet strong within character as in aliens and hunter being the short tough texan speaking cop as in raising arizona harry connick jr a very good jazz singer shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter which comes to the moment of judgement drum roll please copycat is a good thriller although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about minutes into the show copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats in anticipation of the killers next immediate move this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts nice movie to bring your girlfriend to 
luckily some people got starship troopers some people knew it was supposed to be silly for those of you who didn t how could you miss it from the very beginning when we see an interactive internet like promotional video for the armed forces of the future it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly i guess without blatant one liners and home alone style slapstick some people just don t recognize such goofy humor such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned first thing to do before seeing this movie lighten up meet the equivalent of beverly hills meets mighty morphin power rangers four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces which in the future means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country johnny rico casper van dien is ready to join the infantry mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez denise richards has enlisted to be a pilot dizzy flores dina meyer has enlisted as a trooper and it s possible she s joining merely to follow rico whom she s always had eyes for if you saw these three on the street you d automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers for never has a movie s cast looked so much like the cut out cover of seventeen magazine the lone non supermodel carl jenkins played by doogie howser himself neil patrick harris is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie er carl out of the picture good call now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters right off the bat rico becomes the star of the show far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen leaves rico ready to call it quits with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home well sorry rico suave but there s no place like home especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it that s right the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid like alien beings that a can of raid just isn t going to destroy with a sudden change of heart and clothes rico is back in the game following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs what starship troopers really is is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on the soap opera like love affairs of high school the love for sci fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group etc nothing is taken seriously it s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless but with its sly and futuristic approach it s not as recognizably so it s a spoof so subtle that many won t recognize the spoofery if you deem this as sci fi action you re wrong it s sci fi action comedy with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film but the gore too is meant to be cheesy yes it s graphic but it s also brutally phony and that s what makes it such great fun to watch not since the old mr bill skits on saturday night live has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters barbie dolls as young children with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely it s a good chance this is the case whether we re fully aware of it or not starship troopers has it s slow parts but it s truly an alternative to your typical sci fi action flick or lame juvenile comedy aside from the intentionally cheesy gore the special effects are quite astounding when the spaceship passes a meteor it s quite an awesome spectacle visually crisp and captivating if you re looking for brainless fun this is the epitome of your search a beautiful cast awesome special effects fast paced action campy acting and a whole lot of gore this is brainless heaven just remember not to think 
having not seen who framed roger rabbit in over years and not remembering much besides that i liked it then i decided to rent it recently watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is aside from the fact that it s a milestone in animation in movies it s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters have them interact and make it convincingly real and a great entertainment it s also quite an effective comedy mystery while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original especially baby herman and watching them together is a lot of fun the story begins in hollywood in cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work so hard boiled private detective eddie valiant bob hoskins is called in by studio head r k maroon alan tilvern to try to help get roger s mind back on work maroon thinks that roger s wife jessica s possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots valiant takes some photos of jessica playing patty cake with marvin acme stubby kaye the owner of toontown where all of the cartoon characters live and takes them to maroon upon seeing them roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town and eventually toontown trying to clear roger s good name along the way they meet judge doom christopher lloyd a judge jury and executioner type who s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a toon who framed roger rabbit won academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production which included hundreds of animators also bob hoskins performance should be credited he in addition to the rest of the human cast finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co stars according to the internet movie database hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off who framed roger rabbit is a rare film one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom do yourself a favor and rent it p p p p please 
synopsis an attractive mute makeup artist working on an ultra cheesy slasher movie in moscow witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians meanwhile the artist s sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her comments mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it drawn by the clever artwork on the video box i rented the film expecting a complete turkey mute witness however was original offbeat and well made it s one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about i ve subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit and it may be seen on occasion on the independent film channel the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense as billy the quite believable mute heroine sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy s vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures to throw a curveball into the fray billy s sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film look for alec guinness obi wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy in a small role as the evil reaper definately check this movie out although as a word of warning it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren t for the squeamish 
 the end of the affair is a dark and moody romantic period piece that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs although it s slow and sometimes confusing to follow it still manages to give audiences a moving experience based on graham greene s novel of the same name the film mainly follows characters there s maurice bendrix ralph fiennes who has an affair with henry mile s stephen rea wife sarah julianne moore sarah finds henry to be a bore because well he s just a normal guy it s all work and no play with him while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah and would do anything for her unfortunately the two break up this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks so that leads us to the present it s a few years later and they both still think of each other so maurice hires a private detective ian hart to see what sarah is up too while this may sound straight forward it s not it s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men unhappiness and the ever lasting love all this may sound like a drag but it really captures your interest with great performances by ralph fiennes doing another english patient type of film only this movie is better and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all films she did in i believe this was the role she had the most passion for and you can see why the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan even though i didn t read the book there s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive what s so moving about it you ask the tragedy of it all it s not the typical romance in which a guy finds a girl they fall in love and all is well this is more complicated and depressing it really shows the complexity of a relationship because nothing is ever perfect everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces back to neil jordan s script it wasn t only red roses there were times when i felt it too be a little slow but most romances are it also tended to be a bit confusing especially at the start it keep jumping around from past to present so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan i d have to say this is his finest achievement to date because quite frankly i ve never really found his work to be up to par it just never did anything for me until now when it ends it leaves viewers a little saddened but provoked nonetheless this is definitely one of the best films of and had some of the best acting most notably by moore not for all movie goers but for those who are film buffs and want something of value 
lean mean escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by most are unnecessarily complicated and others have no sense of expediency the thrill ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive which featured none of the flash bang effects of today s market but rather a bread and butter textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about the latest tony scott movie enemy of the state doesn t make it to that level it s a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers without looking back although director scott has made missteps in the past such as the lame thriller the fan he s generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun that vibrant spirit is present here shown in well timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views angles lenses and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie enemy is truly a visual experience and that s only one of the reasons it s such a fun watch the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds jon voight reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee reynolds has the senator offed but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist s camera by an extremist chain of events the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean will smith s posession and it s not long before he s running from reynolds cronies it s only with the help of an ex spook named brill gene hackman that dean is able to get to the bottom of things the acting is top notch and the three principles smith hackman and voight are generally more mature and excellent all around smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role smith s regular joe comes off particularly well as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not the supports are also in fine form lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas this is for the holiday crowd the hot ticket as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking 
director dominic sena who made the highly underrated kalifornia and producer jerry bruckheimer the rock armageddon bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen nicolas cage plays memphis a retired car thief who s pulled back in to the business by an evil car thief overlord christopher eccleston determined to kill memphis kid brother giovanni ribisi memphis is ordered to steal cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang memphis sets out to put his old crew back together but discovers that most of them have retired as well gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits in that sequence we get a rockin little tune from moby along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride and what follows doesn t disappoint cage turns in one of his good performances here he can easily go either way good or bad i don t know how he does that and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely of the supporting cast members angelina jolie as memphis former love is in the film just to provide eye candy she s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i ve ever seen and robert duvall as memphis former mentor is just around to lend the film some class also i m a big fan of will patton armageddon the postman and would love to see him get a huge role someday none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles delroy lindo get shorty shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis as does timothy olyphant go as lindo s partner i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll there s no doubt in anyone s mind that the cars will be successfully stolen and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the rival car thief plot line as it stands that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package but if i was making this film i d have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew thereby making memphis have to improvise thereby adding some meat to the plot the finale is essentially just a big car chase and there just aren t ways to make car chases interesting anymore it s all been done the chase is also shot and edited in that jerry bruckheimer action sequence kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene sure it s a car chase but what exactly are the particulars of it it s very hard to tell finally there s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the bus jumping the ramp sequence from speed in the oh i don t think so department despite those minor complaints gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment it s not thought provoking but it s shiny loud and fun just what a summer flick should be pg 
one of the last entries in the long running carry on series carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a caravan site professors anna vrooshka elke sommer and roland crump kenneth williams and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep kenneth connor so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick for instance when anna is asking for scrubbers for dirty caravan she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan arthur upmore bernard bresslaw and his wife linda patsy rowlands take her mother daphne barnes joan sims and her minah bird on holiday with them mother in law jokes prevail furthermore the trouble that joe and norma baxter ian lavender and adrienne posta have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families fred ramsden windsor davies and ernie bragg jack douglas leave their wives liz fraser and patricia franklin behind for a fishing holiday however they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls sandra carol hawkins and carol sherrie hewson the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day to day running of the camp the search for the minah bid and greyhound the major fred and ernie s desperate need of a woman a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park s pub and a shock in store for daphne the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing this is what binds the movie together joan sims stands out as the demanding mother in law bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast on the other hand there are low key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors although the regular cast is depleted the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film a relative flop at the cinema this movie deserves a lot more recognition 
i guess it s a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour could not be ruined even by the nauseating comedy of chris tucker i m a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium and this movie lets him not only do his impressive as ever martial arts schtick but show off his comic timing as well it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects this time around the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan john lone who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states i m still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns of course it s up to hong kong detective lee chan and trash talking lapd detective james carter tucker to take the bad guys out and the authorities to the extent that they even exist stay out of their way rush hour turns the tables on the first film in that here it s carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan he refuses to shut up not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head but his jokes just aren t funny a pathetic mixture of sub par eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock white man black man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates but didn t anyone realize how irritating tucker s incessant ranting and raving was if this is all the comedian has to offer then i don t care to see any more of his films fortunately chan makes for a marvelous straight man and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely it s not often that one actor can so completely save a movie but there is no other name for what he does whenever he s on screen rush hour comes to nearly breathtaking often hilarious life much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a player but who cares i can think of few high concepts that are funnier the movie ends with outtakes that as usual show that chan isn t perfect and that it does indeed take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless chris tucker botches some lines as well and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie a lot of people have pointed out rush hour isn t very different from its predecessor in tone or style but i liked the original and i like the sequel though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it director brett ratner the family man keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works it s not great jackie chan but it s jackie chan and that s enough up next jay and silent bob strike back 
as with his other stateside releases jackie chan s latest chopsocky vehicle mr nice guy is contrived blockheaded and lacking in narrative logic but also like those other films it is a highly enjoyable ride once again chan s screenwriters here edward tang and fibe ma have taken the easy way out and named their star s character simply jackie with no last name this jackie is a world class chef who co hosts a popular cooking show on australian television of course jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter s gabrielle fitzpatrick expose of a drug dealing ring other plot details involving a videotape and a biker gang are irrelevant in fact as is the case with most chan films the plot itself is just about irrelevant the sole purpose of mr nice guy s existence are chan s comic fight scenes and those here do not disappoint director samo hung who has a cameo role a longtime collaborator of chan s does not waste any time putting chan in action diving head on into a wild chase fight shootout after a brief cooking show prologue other impressive set pieces follow most notably a chase in a mall which directly leads to some frenzied if cliched can you say fruit cart business involving a runaway carriage and an extended late film sequence at a construction site in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards cement mixers and a deadly buzzsaw none of the action sequences in mr nice guy are as spectacular as supercop s thrilling helicopter train finale or rumble in the bronx s daring leap between two buildings nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor respectively but the action delivers even if the energy peters out before the film s end the finale as spectacular as it is is a letdown for fans of chan s athletic prowess filmed almost entirely in english even so the voices of some english speaking actors are laughably dubbed mr nice guy hints at jackie chan s latest transition to hollywood productions he made ill fated attempts with s the big brawl and s the protector next in the pipeline is rush hour a stateside production co starring chris tucker hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr nice guy for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands much like they have been before 
do film critics have morals are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow naturally we don t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish secondly and along the same line we can t prejudge a film because of it s stars director etc the difference well in the first one we d go into a film thinking it s going to be dumb or it s going to be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb so i m not expecting much on the second hand we re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal grudge against the film company it s made by disney oh it s just a merchandising ploy then the actors jim carrey s in it it s gonna stink or the director who can t be that good this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint make sense ok but what about comparing isn t that kind of along the same lines when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer s credibility in one film to another they were involved in is that really fair sure in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more but what about jackie brown for example is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both i think it is and i ll tell you why a good critic should be able to view the film from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film sometimes that can be tough the acting was superb but i was bored or i loved it it was sooooo cheezy might be used to describe a film these are contradictions and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique but which is more important and which is better an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again getting back to the point my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway every average person out there who s interested in this film is likely to ask how does it compare to pulp fiction and so as a critic i m already responsible to ask that same question jackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the s who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character tarantino s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta s sudden revival in the movie industry and with talks of an oscar nomination the same is likely to happen for grier we ve made it thru comparison jackie is a year old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fiction s samuel l jackson and comparison ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half million dollars trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotics as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell s plans and not as friendly intended as we d hope he posts jackie s bail after she is put behind bars the thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and as we learn from his previous actions he s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze ordell won t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she s always done yet at the same time a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided it comes down to a simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help the law ordell or maybe just herself coming into play is another s veteran robert forster as jackie s bail bondsmen max cherry max s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance also involved is ordell s surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda a ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role but there s nothing more to her and therefore she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself de niro is a brilliant actor but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn t need a de niro to play him compared to pulp fiction comparison the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable in pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast the exception being grier tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth sadly grier too could have received a bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newly jarred perception of life jackson teams up with tarantino again but the chemical reaction isn t as awesome as the first time jules was the rambling bible quoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off and although jackson is really really good in jackie brown i don t think he s quite as irreplaceable in fact maybe a new face would have been better jackson could ve remained tarantino s jules and a new guy could have become ordell forever to remain so in our memories sadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just isn t as impressive and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning this is grier s film so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard s novel rum punch for those movie goers don t expect another pulp fiction and you ll be satisfied for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of s film making the directing has toned down a bit however yet we re still reminded that this is tarantino s movie thanks to odd split screen story telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints so getting back to the question that i began with this isn t pulp fiction at all it s good but it isn t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place this is a more conservative tarantino but not one that won t satiate true fans if you can realize that this isn t going to knock your socks off then you ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet after all we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy 
this is a film about secrets some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl frances boyd ashley others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines stephen ramsey the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healy louie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work and still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line receiving a summer grant to study chemo electric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together as their three year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab which is off limits to her as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses his main argument is that this is what the public wants they don t want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments they just want the benefits of science that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science science as a business as opposed to the good science science that cares about the small farmer which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins the third view in all this is the artist s represented by lillian who points out that the artist s work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly why shouldn t the same be true of the scientist she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public questioning what is good or evil in society something that bad science has completely ignored geoffrey impatient to get ahead with his research feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on as he contacts one of the company s higher ups to argue his case but decides he can t wait any longer for their help so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog of frances a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car he is spotted by alex and one of his co workers and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife afraid that alex will spot what he is doing as he rushes away from the area in the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart of the film as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything the scientists engage in a rational argument highlighting their different points of view while lillian reacts in an emotional way siding mostly with david s view but coming at it from a much different angle it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies that the director s point of view is absolutely right is beside the point the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one dimensional characters geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster alex vine was likened to his last name the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex s apartment geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it and mercifully the dog dies the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage but she also fails to respond to david s loving gesture for her to stay with him instead opting to head back to the city the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way what is progress what can one expect out of life is the small farmer about to become extinct the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions leaving no room for deeper arguments is the shame of this decent and smart film that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me as i don t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit that inspite of its shortcomings it was worth seeing because of its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso s guernica had for him both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on the pain that lillian feels as she forgets about her desires to raise a family and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song make the world go away blares out from the background after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband all in the name of science had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science perhaps the most pertinent question the film asks requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business as the question becomes can science be happily married with art 
probably the most popular and praised film of all time turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron combining visual and sound effects he re creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes while their cabin is slowly filling up with water a mother is telling her children a fairytail and they lived happily ever after and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air however the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues in the present day the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett bill paxton a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond lost during the sinking somewhere inside the ship lovett s crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead here in the shape of a nude young lady is a window into the distant age of lovett is extremely surprised when he get s a phone call from rose dawson claiming that she is a model she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in years as the memories come flooding back she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer kate winslet the fianc e of wealthy cal hockley billy zane and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater frances fisher on board there are rich and poor everyone trust in the ship s designer jonathan hyde and her master captain e j smith bernard hill on board the ship rose unhappy and restless meets jack leonardo dicaprio a young american artist poor brave and attractive a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes but also face the greatest power on earth death cameron could as well have called his picture the never ending love or love at first sight as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple and not on the disaster itself the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap opera the director doesn t even try to overcome his empty script because of its primitive and predictable plot titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking russel carpenter s rich majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award worthy everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch but it doesn t help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them the actors are not to blame because their characters are more like caricatures in other words fake jack is a man with many talents he is a talented artist handsome brave honest strong funny you name it he doesn t have any dark side he doesn t make any mistakes that for a second would make him human jack is perfect but he is poor on the other hand we have cal he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife to be he lacks everything jack possesses but he is rich this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture cameron knows precisely what we want to see his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience attractive actors a tragic love story beautiful visuals including expensive special effects a dose of social criticism a fascinating historical event we love true stories and last but not least an incredible media support which proclaimed an average picture the greatest film of all time on the outside titanic looks perfect but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals is emptiness nothing to think about the main weakness of this film which ironically became its success is simplicity cameron enables our basic and if you wish primitive emotions love hate fear and helplessness everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable a sinking ship titanic is a typical hollywood production totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot it s a good picture but absolutely not a masterpiece it s among hundreds and thousands good films released every year not better or worse than the average american film

steven spielberg s amistad which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who owned them is concerned with several different aspects of this story first the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery second it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins last and most importantly it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade amistad succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another anti slavery movie having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery i doubted that there was much i didn t already know about it fortunately i turned out to be wrong for one thing spielberg s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders operations in africa so amistad was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning and some of the images here are in fact much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery one scene in the middle in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their excess slaves by throwing them overboard to drown has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc rating the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time exposing politicians as narrow minded opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff of course but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time such that john quincy adams and probably other politicians like him who clearly disapproved of the practice was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court the biggest success of amistad is probably the characterization of cinque djimon hounsou who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin matthew mcconaughey the lawyer who represents them in court through cinque we are given a window into the native culture as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that again contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles what kind of country is this where laws almost work he asks baldwin in bewilderment when he learns that the case must be re tried before the supreme court spielberg s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque s angry outburst in the court room still there isn t enough of this for it to be a serious problem the main flaw in this film which prevents it from earning four stars is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can t quite handle all of these issues at the same time so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie this summer s contact for example dealt with several issues at once but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and most importantly all of them were resolved at once amistad tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams but it somehow feels a little forced and in any case the speech itself which lasts almost fifteen minutes wears out its welcome about halfway through perhaps the best way to describe it is this amistad is three four star films edited into one almost every individual scene works but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence and thus is less than the sum of its parts however i can t honestly say how it could have been done differently and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery 
most sequels don t do what they re supposed to do like toy story does far too many of them end up re hashing the original and adding very little is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors thankfully toy story is a wonderful exception i can t remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one it s yet another sign that pixar the acclaimed animation studio behind toy story and a bug s life is still at the top of its game woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the hit toy story and things have changed a bit since the last one ended woody voiced by tom hanks is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp in his absence he has assigned buzz lightyear tim allen now comfortable in his role as a toy to take charge unfortunately woody s trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale and is stolen by an over zealous toy collector wayne knight off to save him are buzz and members of the old toy gang including mr potato head don rickles rex the nervous dinosaur wallace shawn hamm the piggy bank john ratzenberger and slinky dog jim varney while in captivity woody makes a startling discovery he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a s children s show entitled woody s roundup he meets the show s other characters which include jesse joan cusack his cowgirl sidekick the wise old prospector kelsey grammer and bullseye his trusty horse they have all been anxiously awaiting woody s arrival as once their set is completed they will be sold to a japanese toy museum and finally escape storage forever this means woody now faces a difficult choice with his friends coming to rescue him does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever as in the original film toy story contains first rate animation and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there reportedly the film was originally slated for a direct to video release but after seeing the improvements that had been made disney rightly decided to release it into theaters the film is well worth seeing on the big screen the colors are bright the textures sharp and even the human characters look more human the animation is consistently seamless with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable there are so many impressive sequences that i d find it impossible to list them here but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al s toy barn the store owned by woody s captor pixar s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it the voice work is also perfectly complementary and as with the first movie does much to help further character development tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz making you forget who is doing the voice it was woody and buzz up there not tom and tim all the cast members from the original reprise their roles and each is excellent several new voices have been added with joan cusack kelsey grammer and wayne knight doing fine work toy story is strong in characterization and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie woody faces difficult choices while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn t yet realized his status as a toy forcing him to see what he used to be like the new characters are also developed quite well especially jesse who narrates a sarah mclachlan aided flashback illustrating how she was loved then forgotten by her owner it may be computer animated and it may have sappy music but it s downright touching the script despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers is endlessly clever and inventive especially considering that it s a sequel the reason toy story works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original s success by re doing the same story and using the same characters not this one we get character change new characters and new issues brought up toy story is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here the humor is sharp and witty with something to amuse both kids and adults there are funny asides to films such as star wars and jurassic park among others new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock em sock em robots and appearances from other pixar efforts a bug s life and the short geri s game geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody s broken arm the action is fast and furious and the chases in the street in a toy store in an elevator on a baggage carousel and in an airplane keep getting bigger and better toy story never grows stagnant because there is always something new to hold your interest the more you pay attention to it the more rewarding it is it s rare to see a film like toy story come along because it s the kind of film that s almost impossible to dislike it s created purely to entertain and though i enjoy a thought provoking drama as much as the next person it s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do send us out with a smile it s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing toy story it s the rare sequel that manages to expand on and live up to the original 
pulp fiction quentin tarantino s anxiously awaited and superb follow up to reservoir dogs is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about loved and hated films of all time in all fairness it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it as if reservoir dogs wasn t perfect tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction a fast paced hard talking roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor to begin with the two hit men vincent vega john travolta and jules winnfield samuel l jackson these two characters work together perfectly and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect travolta in fact is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role if these two characters were not enough there s the struggling boxer butch coolidge bruce willis the two small time criminals pumpkin tim roth and honey bunny amanda plummer the big man in charge marsellus wallace ving rhames and his attractive young wife mia uma thurman and the problem solver himself the wolf harvey keitel these are just the major characters smaller roles but equally terrific are handed to jimmie quentin tarantino a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business lance eric stoltz the far out drug dealer as well as maynard duane whitaker and zed peter greene two hillbillies who are the men behind no pun intended for those of you who have seen this a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film the film interweaves three stories that at first seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold ups the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop unknowing of what lies ahead after this the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss marsellus wallace after basically toying with the men especially the unfortunate brett frank whaley vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a hand cannon shooting at the two gangsters he somehow completely misses them leading jules to cite divine intervention this is also the basis for more of the now famous tarantino dialogue the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight but when he does not marsellus vows to find him wherever he is and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune vincent meanwhile has the honor of taking marsellus wife mia out on a date while the big man is out of town vincent obviously is rather nervous about this especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage after their date which seems to rather smoothly things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent s high priced heroin dubbed a monster by lance each story continually progresses and new and amazing events occur eventually the stories all meet each other in the end with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant which happens to contain both vincent and jules pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade and possibly of all time along with its superb dialogue action writing directing and acting this film will not only latch onto you but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you and with most fans of this movie this is proved to be a rather easy task although at times the graphic images violence and language may seem a bit overpowering surely quentin tarantino s fame was greatly escalated by this film and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon 
star wars episode the phantom menace review by matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas classic star wars the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more americans today can explain what the force or a jedi is than a budget deficit or a serb so years after the release of the original and years since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons against this challenge the fourth star wars film episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week and despite some early critical reviews in the major media the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is a worthy sequel er prequel to the original star wars films the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films as the film opens obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars is only a young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor qui gon jinn liam neeson the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations but in the middle of a planetary invasion rushing to protect naboo s young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice on tatooine qui gon discovers a young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts qui gon senses the child is unusually strong with the force and begins to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being a galactic savior the innocent looking year old will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out a lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sounds a bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knights anakin s turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story moves quickly with the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode one of the reasons the film s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused it s unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movies were clearly luke s story with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight but it s unclear whether this new film is anakin s story or obi wan s if this trilogy is centered on anakin it s a shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers and as a result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little boy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that qui gon is willing to believe he is the one the rest of the cast does fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight mcgregor is well cast as obi wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fits the role of a young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters but the interaction between them individually the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesn t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another in star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obi wan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other individually they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging many of the wonderful elements of lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaur sized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers on venetian looking planet of naboo watch a spectacular event part roman chariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings he creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines most of the new special effects in his re released special edition trilogy in were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren t possible when the films were made more than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures robots with personalities and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters the best such character is watto a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room of all the computer generated characters in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computer generated characters no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks with more than minutes of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include a fully computer generated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon s accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs a comic relief role in the film lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors however despite the technological magic that makes his character possible jar jar isn t completely convincing he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends a roger rabbit like presence you accept that he s there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially i found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film on my second viewing of the film jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn t mind him at all a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the film s struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about one s destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasn t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar to a one man two headed announcer team calling the action at the film s thrilling pod race sequence to a cameo appearance by e t in the film the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun with lots of half hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace works because as in all his films there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning to end there are light saber battles hair raising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil the pod race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film and the final showdown between obi wan qui gon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed the phantom menace won t win any major oscars it probably won t beat titanic s box office record and it s not even the best star wars film i d put it third after the original and the empire strikes back but it s an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film can t live up to it s hype no film not even the original star wars could have done that but it s still worth seeing probably more than once 
roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton this italian film star best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust but benigni s life is beautiful la vita e bella is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love devotion and sacrifice the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni s guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him most notably the almost forgotten harry langdon benigni s guido has a childlike innocence he ignores the growing anti semitism of the fascist government instead guido ardently falls in love and persues dora a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official in benigni s tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate yet slapstick encounter guido wins dora they marry fast forward about five years guido dora and their year old son giosue giorgio cantarini are a happy family guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore but racial and anti semitic tensions are on the rise in italy and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp here guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son but to keep him from being exterminated it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror the pain the unimaginable suffering of a schindler s list true many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over and most were not sent to the death camps but to work camps where they were used as slave labor unlike steven spielberg benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child for guido to save his son transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game giosue must follow the rules without question to amass points the winner takes home a tank therefore guido tells him he must remain hidden in the barracks he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates guido lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive throughout their imprisonment guido s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm s way ultimately the allies rescue the camp in a poignant scene giosue comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound the boy goes wide eyed with wonderment and delight thinking he has won the game the price for his victory is most high benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness life is beautiful is a fantasy a fable it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust those who object to it are missing its point and that is simply where there is hope where there is life and where there is love the spark of humanity will never be extinguished committed to lifelong learning through effective communication 
warren beatty s bulworth is a caustic political comedy that doesn t attack any particular political group but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system some might think this film is vulgar and in many ways it is however as loud and raucous as it is bulworth speaks the truth which is almost always ugly to hear beatty who directed the film and co wrote the script with jeremy pikser the lemon sisters stars as incumbent u s senator jay billington bulworth who has one of the best politician names in cinema history bulworth is a democrat and in beatty s view he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party once an ideological liberal like beatty still is bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden which was once the calling card of democrats bulworth has become another sell out money hound if he s not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese he s making wind bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium blah blah blah when the film opens it is a few days before the primary elections and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become in a fit of desperation he takes out a million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee and then hires a hit man to kill him although he doesn t know who the assassin will be or when the hit will take place knowing that he will soon be dead bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general at a compton church he tells the group of african americans that they will have no power in the u s unless they put down that malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife later in a particularly hilarious sequence bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he s there is because my guys always put the big jews on my schedule all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade bulworth s chief of staff dennis murphy oliver platt follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment platt has some of the movie s funniest scenes as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet his constant half truth telling and spin doctoring to cover bulworth s stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self righteous reporter nora dunn who acts like murphy s refusal to explain bulworth s actions something he really cannot do is somehow an act of treason when bulworth decides he wants to live after all and therefore must constantly evade a grim looking assassin to be who s trailing him at every turn he hides out in the ghetto complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews at this point beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner city experience bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina halle berry who he meets at the harlem church rally she has a tough talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l d don cheadle of boogie nights who also becomes involved in bulworth s campaign some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner city films like boyz n hood and menace ii society bulworth s chief liability is beatty s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device instead of speaking at political rallies he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip hop stars are black it s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad or whether he s actually that incompetent at any rate the rap sounds more run d m c than snoop doggy dogg which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner city lingo and working that into his speeches instead of trying to sound like l l cool j other than that bulworth hits all its targets with wry hilarious accuracy the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party and even if you don t agree with beatty s liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics unlike primary colors which opened earlier this year bulworth doesn t try to tip toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home instead it takes them dead on 
titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it s upsetting that it isn t the film which cost million to make and could of put th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it sunk pun intended is a labour of love for cameron who wrote and directed the film we all know that big budget dosen t mean great film see waterworld but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic but sadly titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece although it is one of cameron s best films the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic they find a safe and inside a picture of a woman the woman in the picture an old winslet tells the explorers that the picture is of her the explorers invite her over and she then tells her story of titanic in the flashback dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson who after winning a poker game wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic leaving liverpool to go to america also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater winslet who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen t love at all cal hockley zane so her family can remain rich she nearly commits suicide on the ship but jack comes to the rescue saves rose they fall in love and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them oh yeah and the ship sinks and that is the main problem with the film and which stops it from being a work of genius the story and script both by cameron are both weak the story is full of cliched characters the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry the poor boy with heart the stuck up mother and poor dialogue the script consists of lots of in jokes of how the boat won t sink and most of the dialogue is pretty basic it s a shame really as the audience does have to sit through hours of this film without good dialogue a film could become a very long very boring film like camerons own terminator but luckily there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear firstly there s cameron s direction there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end there is a lot of mayhem and panic all done very well by cameron it s a scary sight watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below thanks to cameron s direction then the audiences attention is held for the full hours minutes to support the directing are the excellent cast working very well with their underwritten characters dicaprio is good although he only looks years old his performance of a over excitiable yet also well mannered boy is excellent and he also has some funny lines winslet is great also and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth zane is deliciously evil as cal saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash the audience really does come to hate him he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he s in like dead calm but he does it really really well also worthy of note is kathy bates edward scissorhands as a loud mouthed american finally the icing on the great things cake are the special effects cameron is a whiz with effects just watch aliens terminator and true lies and they are used very well throughout the sweeps of the ships are awesome although digital domain who did the effects cannot animate human movement too well the humans seem to move to smoothly there s just something odd about them you can tell that they have been animated on a computer of course the ship sinking scenes are awesome with bodies flying all over the place and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film titanic then is a wonder of directing acting and cgi but not writing and story again like most of camerons films the editing is loose cameron edits himself and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts titanic then although not the godfather of movies it could of been is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius enjoyable scary and even sad titanic is a film cinema was invented for filling the screen with incredible images and assaulting the ears with awesome sound a superb film but sadly not perfect overall rating 
errol morris critically acclaimed director of the documentary fast cheap and out of control vaults to new heights with mr death this film an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a leuchter jr is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise stunning even the more jaded minds among us don t let the film s cheesy dissuade you following this sideshow of horror lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter s life and mind morris follows the trail of leuchter s madness with appalling lucidity revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with this leuchter guy is seriously messed up virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries in spite of his lack of credentials after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows leuchter came to the attention of neo nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his theory that the holocaust never happened morris s interviews are surprisingly congenial drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch leuchter seems completely at ease sometimes jovial part of this effect may be due to morris s new interviewing machine called the interrotron which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer this was the first time morris had used the device and the results are startling combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter s reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant and you ve got one compelling and disturbing documentary while this film isn t for the feeble minded or weak hearted it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i for one feel bettered by the experience 
you ve got to love disney no matter what they serve up it is a guaranteed success as long as it s animated kids have to go see the movie then they have to get the toys oh the video came out got to buy it or risk little billy s temper tantrums for the next month all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca a visit to the magic kingdom stay at the disneyland hotel buy a disney t shirt eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick it s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it dale carnegie should have had it so good what s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality you see disney animated features these days have two components theme and plot the theme changes with each new movie the plot does not the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same however while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box office receipts merchandising dollars and glimmers in the eyes of little children critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer luckily disney s latest animated offering mulan manages to be engaging and refreshing even while rife with formula the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns led by the imposing shan yu miguel ferrer soon china s emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china s defense when the fa family is served notice it is the elderly father fa zhou soon tek oh who must answer the call as there are no other males in the household fearing her father will surely be killed in battle fa mulan ming na wen disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army mulan based on a chinese epic poem is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman s role and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband we see that grace is not one of her strong points very early on we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one s family and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker mulan fails at that task by leaving home to fight in her father s place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too as is the case with most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film i m not sure if they will get much airplay but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time both lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain of mulan s army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salonga s voice translates much better to animation you have to hear it to understand interestingly the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan there is no significantly big number which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie it is however an expectation which has been built by disney s own formulaic history and some viewers may feel as if something is missing artistically the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works it helps to contribute a more authentic and therefore more credible nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically disneyfied ethnic tale there are also a couple of visually standout scenes one involving the charge of shan yu s hun army which utilizes the same computer enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it when mulan resolves to take her father s place she dons her father s old battle armor and unsheathes a sword as she does so you can see her reflection in the polished metal it just left me thinking that was really cool a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film varying from the straight such as soon tek oh as fa zhou to the comical such as harvey fierstein as yao a gruff pugilistic member of shang s conscripted army even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance i found the choice of b d wong as shang a little strange you may remember him as martin short s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast so i guess anything s possible in any event wong performs admirably as well one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people june foray who supplies grandmother fa s speaking voice is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale as in boris and natasha marni nixon who provides grandmother fa s singing voice is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i maria in west side story and eliza in my fair lady with this in mind hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films in an effort to be culturally sensitive and to avoid a miss saigon type debacle disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian american actors for both lead and supporting roles in addition to the actors already mentioned the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong gedde watanabe james shigeta and george takei i guess clyde kusatsu wasn t available at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and happily adults this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next rather than hope that the next one is better 
 six days seven nights is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare here s a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it s fluff recognizes it s fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff of course the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie s success ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it s easy to forget what a funny guy he can be as his female counterpart anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet goofily charismatic performance the age difference ford s heche s matters not these two click in a charged way that s hard to come by the story is a no brainer ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris while heche is career minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe robin on a tropical vacation with fianc frank david schwimmer gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there the plane crashes during a terrible storm and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization a series of unpleasant often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other meanwhile back at the resort frank is tempted himself by quinn s shapely female tagalong jacqueline obradors that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn robin pairing and while it makes for a few good laughs early on it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways this flaw is only a minor inconvenience director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk at a slim minutes six days seven nights never wears out its welcome where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title michael browning s clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one liners my favorite taken in context is you mean arrrgh pirates and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another they re all quite engaging even the movie s more serious moments are played with a wink heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the believability of six days seven nights heterosexual pairing so she s a lesbian so what deal with it of course it doesn t and here her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way in fact her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click these opposites attract with the utmost endearing electricity at one point when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest heche asks ford how old he is after several wrong guesses forty five fifty he whispers his age to her you still look good heche stammers i still am good ford replies she s good too and together they make six days seven nights one memorable ride 
for example in happy gilmore sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self confident jerk of a pro if the star were any other comic that would be enough motivation to drive the movie but with sandler the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house that extra motive doesn t make happy gilmore a funnier movie it doesn t really add any genuine emotional depth either in fact the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie but sandler s philosophy seems to be if it s a token gesture why not make it a nice gesture that is endlessly refreshing in the wedding singer sandler is right on track the fact that he s a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm he could make fun of the fat ugly or embarrassing people he meets at weddings and the story would be intact but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family robbie hart sandler doesn t just sing at weddings he also gets the loners to join in and have fun and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding the day comes when robbie has his own wedding and he is stood up by his heavy metal bride the movie is set in robbie takes it hard he doesn t sleep he doesn t eat and he gets punched out at work when he sings love stinks at a wedding julia drew barrymore who waitresses all the weddings in town gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to eventually robbie starts rebounding toward julia he really likes her but she s engaged her fianc is a self confident jerk do i see a trend nope just a formula who doesn t deserve her but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand julia seems to like robbie too but she can t leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc for the off chance that robbie might be serious about her you know the story you ve seen it a million times before there s always a new way to tell it with new lovers new chemistry and new details but it s the same story and sometimes it works the wedding singer works first of all the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective actually it s not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one s own romantic tension sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man struck with an unattainable love barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with sparks don t fly when they kiss but they both seem right for each other second their love is mature they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction they re a cute couple but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material instead they are both looking for someone meaningful someone to settle down with someone to grow old with at a wedding robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by the repulsing situation is taken in stride as if the two were already parents caring for their sick child the s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie other critics liked this movie in part because of the s soundtrack i liked it in spite of the soundtrack often the music and references felt forced for example robbie tells his ex fianc to get out of my van halen t shirt before you jinx the band and they break up ha ha ha get it david lee roth did leave van halen or how about when sammy allen covert robbie s chauffeur friend shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and get this a single silver glove that s exactly what mj used to wear all the time unfortunately making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding that s not to say the movie isn t funny screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before billy madison and happy gilmore and the two make a good combination herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight faced smart aleck style let s hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over with barrymore s charm and sandler s heart it was hard to go wrong 
getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity the film was directed by randal kleiser who brought us such bubble gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon but thanks to kleiser s surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script getting it right is a pleasantly quiet moving and memorable film one geared strictly toward a sophisticated adult audience getting it right stars jesse birdsall emily lloyd s boyfriend in wish you were here as gavin a painfully shy year old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who gasp is still a virgin gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon but expose him to a single year old beauty and he s a mess much to gavin s surprise the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan lynn redgrave a rich married and lonely year old getting it right is the simple story of gavin s awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right that is to find the right woman to fulfill his life getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in depth character development gavin s self conscious voice over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self confident maturity birdsall s superb understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film he seems convincing and authentic throughout the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin s life despite her limited screen time redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin s middle aged seducer for a supporting character joan is unusually and impressively complex thanks in large part to redgrave s magnificent performance gavin is also pursued or perhaps plagued by minnie the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat after minnie and gavin meet at a party she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role and sir john gielgud with his tongue in his cheek embodies the height of arrogance as her father gavin s eventual love interest is jenny the adorable twenty year old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon london stage actress jane horrocks fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character peter cook the great british satirist appears briefly in the film as gavin s uptight employer the scenes of gavin s home life with his parents are also a treat gavin s over protective mother pat heywood whom even woody allen would find overbearing almost steals the movie her life seems limited to just two activities treating gavin like a year old and preparing exotic but inedible meals such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce gavin and his father s attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing getting it right for the most part is very well crafted except for two minor shortcomings first the movie is about minutes too long and consequently it loses momentum at times second the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin s best friend harry and his unfaithful lover winthrop overall however getting it right is quite memorable for its humor depth sophistication and outstanding acting director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard adapting her own highly acclaimed novel deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth maturation and self discovery

capsule bleak and point blank just the way it should be makes its case with cold blooded precision and intelligence serial killer chic is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary and one of the more stomach turning ones i ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry i wasn t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero antihero thankfully that s not the way henry works the director john mcnaughton took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work it doesn t provide cheap jack explanations for henry s behavior it shows him up for what he is an unrepentant and un idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him at the film s opening henry s friend ottis toole has a sister who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago in a viciously riveting scene he admits matter of factly to having murdered his own mother and she covers his hand with hers they are damned together from that moment on henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it there s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron no preface it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker in a scene which many damned the movie for unseen they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment the movie itself however does not glorify the killings but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work only irritation henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame just standing there and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton but he decided to give them something more memorable and consequently the film nearly didn t see release the film does not glorify or justify it just shows us with unflinching coldness what henry was i m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of victim or hero then again probably so would henry 
anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes deep vibrant colors and an epic storyline it s true beauty comes from it s subtle ruminations on the politics of power whether it s between governments or the interplay between a man and a woman anna jodie foster is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband with son in tow she takes the employ of king mongkut chow yun fat to tutor his son in the english language mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country s future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world anna function is to help provide that link the core of the film of course deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide eyed wonder she is assertive yet respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him it is one of foster s strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career she brings a mature self awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster it s a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut s monarchy when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid film she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance chow yun fat s king mongkut is every measure of foster s anna perhaps even more so this is the chow yun fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years he is imposing yet vulnerable playful but stern it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance precious time is stolen from the movie s minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king s concubines bai ling and her love of a commoner it strikes with the subtlety of siam s fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma a country backed by the british anna and the king transcends being a predictable traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness it shows a seduction of intelligence ever mindful of each other s positions anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying if not achingly bittersweet 
in this good natured pleasent and easy going comedy bill murray ghostbusters plays grumpy weatherman phil conners who every year is sent to punxsutawney p a to report on groundhog day the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box and if he dosen t see a shadow it will be an early spring phil really hates the ceremony and not even his producer rita macdowell can change his mind however fate has a cruel trick for phil and he starts re living groundhog day over and over and over until he gradually likes it and rita falls in love with him groundhog day is a well written totatly unoffensive and funny comedy the screenwriters director ramis and danny rubin have written a funny warm but never overly senitmental comedy although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film ramis s direction also helps and although he dosen t try any flash director tricks the film is directed well enough and the jokes are set up well and the editing is also good especially when it shows one part of the day over and over again such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita the performances are also excellent bill murray is great fun and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth and delivers his lines in his usual smary style andie macdowell is good as rita although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film there is chemistry between the two leads thankfully otherwise the whole film would probably fall part chris elliot as the cameraman larry is also funny although you have to like his goofy style otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall the supporting cast aren t bad either with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist in fact there is not one dud performance in this film and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase overall there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all it almost seems perfect however the film can get a bit soppy sometimes and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over and over and over and over also there s not much of an music score and the music there is is pretty bad but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all overall then groundhog day is a funny smart and also has some room in there for some heart an excellent comedy overall rating 
i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn t need a sequel beloved by kids and their parents respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs that first movie remains a landmark of recent history the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply it didn t show and as distributor and part owner of the property at least it had a piece of the action toy story was greenlighted as a direct to video project disney s standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film as someone who doesn t believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing granted they usually are a bad thing but that s because they re made for the wrong reasons i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking fortunately disney claimed to have been so knocked out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full speed ahead with a theatrical sequel lucky thing too like the first movie this one is a joy to behold on the big screen and technically it improves on its predecessor on just about every level from a business standpoint the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar while the previous film s elements are shared between pixar and disney a sign of the production house s new cachet in hollywood visually the main shortcoming of this fully computer generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly making them look a little creepy fortunately that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie where the secret world of toys is more immediate and arguably more attractive than the world of the humans who surround them as before the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy and indeed all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children come to life in the child s absence while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves the real joy of a toy s life is to mean something to its owner one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned left on a shelf to gather dust and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors most often those toys are packed away in dark spaces safe from sunlight and humidity and often they re not even removed from their packaging imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder and you ll understand the attitudes of the collector s items that show up in this movie sheriff woody voiced by a note perfect tom hanks the longtime favorite among andy s toys who was challenged in the previous go round by the arrival of flashy new thing action figure buzz lightyear tim allen suffers an injury early in the film when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart revealing the stuffing inside this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence those anxieties are crystallized when andy s mom tears through his living room collecting old toys for a yard sale and there s an ironic twist to the tale as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum the rest of andy s toys who owe him quite a debt resolve to rescue him that this film manages to turn a box marked cents into a symbol of doom or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma is a testament to its skill at metaphor seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys operating on this level of abstraction toy story tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark sometimes i think toy story tries too hard there s somewhat less of the seat of the pants loopiness that energized the first film allowing it to surprise and excite on a near constant basis and more philosophizing about toys collectors the nature of happiness and the meaning of life while that leads to fewer bellylaughs it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion just don t ask why andy s favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al s toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers buzz lightyear action figures forget the self congratulatory science fiction of the matrix this is a fundamental mind bender for buzz and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight here as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children s tv show that originated his character we see our protagonists come face to face with god in sly ways then toy story can be read as a film about mortality a metaphorical consideration of aging and death significantly the film s very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening night crowd in a near uproar and toward the end when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys one of them observes with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking that it will be fun while it lasts so toy story joins the tradition of children s stories largely neglected of late that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence what s really striking is that both toy story films and to a lesser degree pixar s a bug s life are kids movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts not to mention whatever piece of tot friendly eye candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros animation i m not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention they love traditional narrative too much but boy it makes me wonder what they might come up with next directed by john lasseter colin brady ash brannon and lee unkrich written by lasseter brannon peter docter andrew stanton rita hsaio doug chamberlain and chris webb cinematography by sharon calahan starring voices tom hanks tim allen and joan cusack usa theatrical aspect ratio 
is it just me or have disney films gradually lost their appeal i was almost stunned by the quality of who framed roger rabbit a fun unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together the little mermaid harkened back to and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animations from the first half of the century however the endless stream of the little mermaid wanna be s is getting to me you know the spiel a lame plot recycled from some well known story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson the comedic sidekick sidekicks the seemingly unattainable love interest a few catchy songs a few in jokes for adults and the occasional out of place warner brothers coyote fall off the cliff type joke it s a formula and like any formula it gets tiresome that s why i m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli a japanese cartoon studio from what i ve seen of their movies kiki s delivery service and the already english dubbed and american distributed my neighbor totoro foreign audiences are in for a treat these movies particularly kiki s delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining kiki s delivery service starts with an unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecasts of clear skies decides it is time for her to leave home this is unusual because kiki isn t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch her mother is also a witch and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kiki s mother acts as a village doctor and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom kiki must choose a city to move to and what she chooses is the co star of the movie a german seaport town far removed from the country life she has been used to initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding she s discouraged and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch on the verge of leaving for a new town she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier a one persons delivery service this is where the movie becomes shockingly good kiki s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn t seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light they re three dimensional impossible to quickly evaluate possessing of faults and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl however each one has something about them some interest or trait that makes them interesting and unique the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely looks impressive capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the s this beauty is beauty with depth for every detail left in dozens are only hinted at i could probably go on all day but i won t suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie some of my favorites are kiki s relationship with the baker s husband although he s quiet never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie and he initially scares her his kindness wins her friendship in the garage of a deliveree s house can be found a vintage model t two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master servant to friend friend such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self worth kiki initially seems to derive much of her self worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty this causes kiki to lose faith in herself however kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don t even want to hint at it the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and ironically the most disney esque moment i ve ever seen if you don t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions there is no violence however cartoonish no song and dance number and kiki s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes however i would be surprised if disney doesn t give jiji more jokes or at least the voice of some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not self contradicted a habit disney movies have gotten into beauty and the beast s beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty was derived from a person s inside and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing kiki on the other hand learns to separate her wardrobe from her self image and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for kiki s delivery service not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be but with a greater attention to realism and detail it fits the movie to a t this is particularly true with scenes of kiki s flights the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i ve ever seen i m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states disney tentatively plans a theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that i d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release although the wait is unfortunate it s good to know that it s being released at all for kiki s delivery service is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release watch this movie along with man bites dog and perhaps something by woody allen this is the best movie i ve ever seen

much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of lolita made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made over its use of pedophilia and as such it s important to address it straight forwardly before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years lying around in vaults san a distributor and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit when seeing this film after all the hoopla keeping in mind that there are people namely me who are fans of the novel who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation well you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution what s even worse is that seeing this lolita especially the first time and if you re familiar with anything lolita is admittingly very anticlimactic this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it it s really quite a film perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne although really look at its competition flashdance fatal attraction and indecent proposal at least besides jacob s ladder i ve seen this lolita twice the first time i wasn t so blown away it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting the second time not really thinking about how i ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre it really affected me emotionally the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one which is why it s such a good novel and why this is such a good film the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young year old girl named dolores a k a lolita is great because it s not trash for the perverted but because it s about human obsession with things that are out of one s reach its protagonist the comically named humbert humbert is not your average pedophile but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology something that will destroy us but that we can t live without these ideas are all worked into this film nicely but done in a way that is not heavy handed at all but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating the focus of this film and the reason for making it it seems was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images and scenes which are blatantly over stylized the tone of the book is a comical one but it s also a tragic one and humbert telling the story from his perspective blows every single thing out of perspective humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed we get a sense that perhaps it s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original year old love and allows himself to embody her as lolita he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions and by the end he has nothing but overly dramatic feelings for her the story recognizes the extreme of this almost out of a test seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions and perhaps bring them to peace the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey we can easily sympathize and even identify with him the opening and final images of the film are the same and who hasn t done a similar action that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen the first time being filmed in shock by stanley kubrick who couldn t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do but did the next best thing he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general in that film he used the traps of society as benefits the studio demanded the final scene that of a heinous murder come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile and when you see it it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession the censors wouldn t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the um relationship between humbert and lolita so kubrick decided to play it as comedy but still allow the tragedy to seep through looking at these two versions especially after reading the novel and we all know that when we ve read a novel and see a film adaptation we are bound to be angered by any size differences it s really impossible to compare them they both go for different things and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was and although it s true that several scenes are similar and are thus up for comparison overall it s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is and i won t say that here however this film is pretty amazing mostly because hey i loved the book and this film nearly reminded me of it it doesn t have nearly as much wit a couple comical scenes and even a lot of good chuckles but just not totally witty but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had some of that is in the casting of the two leads jeremy irons with his deep soft british voice and gentle look is an amazing humbert he s droll in a very unique way and well no one can look distraught the way he does he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience and when he looks at lolita with love and she looks at him with lust you know that he s her prisoner for as long as he lives and dominique swain who plays the title character is rather incredible she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction bratiness and self centeredness that marks the character it s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert she loves the attention and knows that she can have her way with him at any time when he denies her something she blackmails him effortlessly a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic and when he stands up to her she weeps and runs away leaving humbert to follow her there are two other minor characters in the film one who s a road block in the beginning and the other who s a reappearing threat to the relationship the former is charlotte lolita s mother played by melanie griffith in the book charlotte is a monster of a woman overbearing constantly scolding her child overly religious and ultimately selfish and she s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal at least in the beginning as played by shelly winters in the original she represented all these qualities as played by griffith here she s about half of them it s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first and even though griffith is not really bad persay she s nothing more the other is clare quilty the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita and succeeds but at a price langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original quilty was a comic character in the original a threat in the form of many forms popping in states of rambling german proning and eventually drunk langella takes the other route allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending the exact opposite of what we thought of him as you can see most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter stephen schiff but just parts of a whole new look at the novel at least cinema wise this version is beautiful and perpetually saddening the camera movements are stylized and each shot is breathtakingly rich the acting is for the most part wonderful and when we watch it we really get a sense that for humbert who is telling the story the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita more importantly it takes us right up the brink of emotion then jumps right over it by the end with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn t regret we feel that we all lose to something we can never have 
well i ll admit when i first heard about this film which was before dante s peak i could just smell what twister had started so now it seems that we re in a full fledged return to the s disaster film era with twister dante s peak volcano and soon flood and james cameron s extremly expensive titanic i ll say first off i enjoyed volcano much more than i did dantes peak part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in i ve been reading a lot about the movie being cheezy or hokey and really didn t see or think that once during the entire film i get bored easily and this film didn t bore me for a minute another thing and boy am i bitching today that bothers me is when critics and such go on about well thats not really possible you know what i couldn t give a bloody damn if it s possible or not really i couldn t it s a freaking movie and i don t want reality thrown in my face i want to be able to see the impossible the all might what if to many reviewers have seen one to many movies the special effects are the second star to this feature they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground they did an incredible job and come oscar time if they remember some notice better be thrown there way 
a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation state against another a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocents anywhere at anytime that gives the figure his label edward zwick s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states you d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad and the u s responds by

off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but as the two form a tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government the original tagline for patriot games was there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil however true it was pulled before the movie s release because it sounded too much like a dare revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america admittedly the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive who s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two thirds but the basic premise is still valid i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action thriller fare of good guy g men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab american population and that in an effort to find the terrorists the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself in fact about halfway through the film when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberties of all americans are put at risk although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups throughout the film maintains a conflict between hubbard who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides it actually gets rather heady at times but it s a credit to screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they don t underestimate the intelligence of the audience i don t know if it s his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great this combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid level authority figure makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i ve seen recently and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable it s somewhat unfortunate that her character s fortitude is broken at a certain point but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough guy role always standing straight and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face however the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film s development notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad a lebanese immigrant the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society difficult to say the least shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick s favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems to be his favorite composer i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian themed music and horner s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish sounding at most revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole it s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we ve been getting throughout the year missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes for example it s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick unfortunately there s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye catching in the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than feet from friendly troops verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point the film also gets a little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different races to get along a noble gesture the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously these flaws are glaring but they don t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class 
i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x files first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable you have to reach for a larger audience therefore the movie is quite user friendly altough non fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no i am not a fan of the x files i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium however since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the x files is what a summer should be exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank from start to finish this movie does not let go of you when i compare it with last summer s movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the x files is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the x files is a monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total no the x files is definately a mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much no this is mulder s time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you let s just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who cares if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies don t the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take a breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the x files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves a purpose who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attacks so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the x files is what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effects it s good some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non fans will have a good time it does not provide answers to the show s many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah i never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half a star well i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop it s pretty obvious the film s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving 
plot a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn t quite know what she wants out of life one day she falls upon something and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others she starts with the people around her but when she suddenly falls for her own guy she can t act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature critique a clever quirky original french flick set in a picturesque paris featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone this is a feel good kind of movie a fairy tale for grown ups who are bummed out about life it doesn t pretend to be deep it doesn t weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters it s basically just a cute movie in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year a sham on so many different levels you might as well slap this film up for consideration also since it s quite a bit better and much more original than the former one thing that this film isn t though at least according to me is the best film of the year it was bestowed the honor of best in at least different film festivals so far this year it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long it s a little over two hours but it felt even longer with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters all of whom weren t as interesting as the lead and a lot of indecisiveness from ms amelie herself which got frustrating thankfully this film doesn t bog itself down with too much of that stuff and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind hearted french girl on the whole it s a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man the lead audrey tautou is perfect for the role and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film unfortunately the rest of the cast isn t as well developed and even though most of them are pretty appealing a couple could ve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot wise by the film s end what happened to the guy in the caf who was spying on his ex girlfriend the whole movie now i haven t seen too many recent french films i will admit but if this is the kind of scene that they re developing over in le pays du vin i wouldn t mind catching more of their flicks in the future crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year which i really liked ironically that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz who is the co star in this film granted the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times i speak and understand french also but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head especially since the film s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn t help but constantly gawk at them but the general idea the background music the nifty french neighborhoods the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story line from the start were all very easy to appreciate and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world in fact i d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol time at the movie house with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts and this guy directed alien resurrection get outta here note i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film it was very original very well shot and very nostalgic as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described good stuff where s joblo coming from chocolat crimson rivers ghost world like water for chocolate o brother where art thou pay it forward rushmore woman on top 
 i know what you did last summer the first high profile slasher thriller to be released after s scream and written by the same screenwriter kevin williamson is a stylish effective horror film that became s biggest hit of the fall season while scream was a more knowing film about the genre i know what you did last summer is more reminiscent of a straight forward slasher flick but it is far more intelligent than such bottom of the barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the friday the th films well okay jason goes to hell was pure hell to sit through the film starts off with four talented aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport n c it is the th of july and they will soon be heading their separate ways kind hearted julie jennifer love hewitt and outsider ray freddie prinze jr will be headed off to college while helen sarah michelle gellar who has just been honored croaker queen in the town and her ignorant jock boyfriend barry ryan phillippe are going to new york to become an actress and football player when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain side beach for the evening they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home distraught and confused they decide they can t go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean in hopes no one will find him julie is apprehensive about it but is forced into it by barry switch to exactly a year later julie still unable to come to terms with what she did reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out almost immediately julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads i know what you did last summer and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook i know what you did last summer is a successful horror film for a number of reasons the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian as it put shadows fog steam and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings the characters particularly julie and helen are realistically written and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort and last the film creates a few dazzling and scary set pieces that are some of the most memorable i ve seen in a horror movie particularly the suspenseful superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family s store with the killer inside with her perhaps the best character is that of missy egan anne heche a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit heche s performance is a standout as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time i know what you did last summer could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems prinze jr gives a performance to be desired here and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth also the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines luckily the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale which includes an expertly crafted jump in your seat scare in the main roles hewitt and gellar are highly talented and hewitt especially is one of the best screamers i ve ever heard she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best scream queen and gellar is touching as a young woman who in the course of one year finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered although not up to the level of either scream movies or the more recent urban legend i know what you did last summer is a respectable smartly scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made 
the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid s point of view is in a word dark you wouldn t expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson s novel but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal jekyll hyde john malkovich is terminally depressed and desperate mary reilly julia roberts is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti woman sentiment of the times director stephen fears version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie it almost appears to be filmed in black and white the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry except there s no red of course the look is so moody and melodramatic that you ll be shocked when you leave the theater i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good but certainly powerless his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience two parts that make up a whole neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated disaster is inevitable the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude when we finally see the transformation the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction not the psychological horror that the tale demands roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles both are suitably melancholy fitting in with the rest of the film the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close and her lips as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives and surprisingly jekyll apparently frequents life and color maybe but this is not close s best role she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character a beautiful film in its own dreary way you ll appreciate the filmmaking craft but don t expect to leave in an upbeat mood 
with storytelling this compelling who needs books based on the book by author james ellroy l a confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years together with director curtis hanson the hand that rocks the cradle the river wild whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight an atom would have to squeeze itself through set in the s the story revolves around policemen of vivid personalities jack vincennes spacey is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention there is also the young hot shot rookie ed exley pearce fresh out of the academy and all out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father the tough and unnerving bud white crowe a cop who believes in justice the swift and violent way policemen distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case happenings began to link itself to the murder the eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised crime in hollywood the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects in l a confidential you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of story going for it there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all surprisingly though spacey did a very convincing job as the street wise vincennes the movie was carried mostly by the two rather unknowns pearce and crowe pearce s exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance crowe s bud white is the most impressive of all head strong and temperamental he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here superb acting wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever easily the best hollywood piece for 
this has some major spoilers for the film so be forwarned the won t appear till later in the article so you re safe for now eyes wide shot running time hours minutes theatrical aspect starring tom cruise dr bill hardford nicole kidman alice hardford sidney pollack leelee sobieski todd field nick nightingale directed co written produced by stanley kubrick inspired by traumnovelle by arthur schnitzer this is an interesting film i must first off state that you musn t believe any of the rumors of the film cruise is not a cross dresser kidman doesn t shoot heroin and there s not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written the translation dream novel makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film rather than complain about it as some may and already have see it as a style of shooting i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly as an auteur and stickler for details kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one the film looks great but there are a good deal of bloopers flubs that occur you see lots of boom shots in reflection and you see the camera at least twice months for this wow reflection is the biggest killer for this film their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these some quite glaringly one more topic of heated discussion i saw the austin powers version and to be perfectly frank unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be you ll probably not see them two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it s supposed to be spoilers below the film itself starts with cruise bill and kidman alice getting ready for a little x mas soiree they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment which is actually an apartment owned by pollack bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party s entertainment soon after bill and alice are flirting with others at the party thinking that the other has not noticed bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time the next day bill and alice casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations they both discover that they both knew about the flirting bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship and gets alice extremely angry in her hazy state she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill not caring about the possible aftereffects bill gets called away when one of his patients dies and goes to console his daughter when his patient s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife alice and a naval officer he sees opportunity as a betrayal to his wife and before they can continue they are interrupted as he strolls home he encounters a hooker seeing another opportunity arise he follows the hooker home they toy around but before the act ensues alice calls his cell phone he breaks the date with the hooker and heads back out into the night he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing so he heads in when he meets the friend the friend reveals that for extra scratch he plays these strange parties while blindfolded bill is intrigued and wants to go to one nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl leelee sobieski and her father the young girl has drawn his eye but her young age and the prescence of her father deter this from happening he gets to the party which is to say the least a strange affair after partaking in some strange religious right women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies a woman warns bill in disguise that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party he is detained after a second warning where he is outed for not being in the group after getting home he hides the evidence of his evenings events unable to carry on in his day he tries piece the events of the previous night together in the process he finds that nick has disappeared his life is possibly in danger and the woman that warned him has died i m trying to save a bit of the film here it s worth sitting through to get to this point this is only about minutes at this point this is a strange film because despite the events that occur the film has a strong family message behind it it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film it s got sex in it it has nudity drugs and many more immoralistic values but they all serve to show why they are bad in one s life i recommend this film highly on many merits cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than minutes after the opening scene and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself 
it was easy to fear the worst begin with a classic s television series add a big budget and an a list star in the lead role and stir script you ask who needs one kid we ve got ourselves a formula that was my fear a bloated monster without any sense of direction then much to my amazement everything that could possibly go wrong didn t the fugitive is as lean taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years under the direction of andrew davis s under siege the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go expect box office to go through the roof deservedly and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones the premise is a simple one dr richard kimble harrison ford is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer a man with an artificial arm after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry kimble finds himself on the run his one goal to find the one armed man andreas katsulas before u s marshall sam gerard tommy lee jones finds him where the fugitive surprises the most is the script by jeb stuart and david twohy in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence its attention to detail and its respect for the audience in an early sequence kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard slick back his hair and change into a lab coat on his way out a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn t know is kimble to zip up his pants it s a small moment but it punches home the urgency of kimble s situation and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget later while trying to lose himself in a parade kimble thinks to drop his overcoat the most likely way he d be recognized from behind it s these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble s tells gerard that he s too smart to be caught he may just be right credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators the bus crash which allows kimble s escape is a spectacular sequence as is a leap from a dam into the water below the action is crisp and brutal and never romanticized special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single mindedness of the two leads and what a pair of performances those leads are tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard because he manages an incredibly challenging feat for the first third of the film there is really no villain per se kimble is on the run and gerard is out to find him it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent vindictive inspector javert but that never happens instead jones plays him as a sharp committed man who s just doing his job so that when he responds to kimble s comment i didn t kill my wife with a matter of fact i don t care we know exactly what he means it s not his job to determine guilt or innocence it s his job to bring in a fugitive this is a well written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form the only unfortunate thing about jones stunning turn is that it s likely to overshadow harrison ford and that s a shame for his entire career ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero however he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing and ford is up to the task this summer has been loaded with action suspense films and most of them have been doing brisk business however it s time for clint sean and various dinosaurs to step aside the chase is on my advice is to catch it 
i had lost all faith in pg movies that are intended for teenagers and adults the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating however after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u my bias is beginning to go away both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers even better i didn t think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts everyone loves surprises u looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets this may be true but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director co writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal to blow the audience s socks off set during the early stages of world war when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u boats u follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship there s only one problem the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as you guessed it u it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors led by an interim captain named tyler matthew mcconaughey to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear once the crew gets on the u boat the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down as soon as the action starts it does not stop and luckily because it is so exciting i didn t want it to stop this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises from the wonderful heart pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men make sure you see this at a theater with surround sound otherwise do not see it all the best parts of u are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations throughout the movie several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler s job as stressful as possible germans gun down their own men tyler s mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory another sailor erik palladino threatens mutiny all of these examples and several others increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler s every move they also make u one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while 
no it is not a bad film in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly event horizon is not your run of the mill sci fi film i m sure many who have watched this will agree with me it is not even original in that sense and it does borrow heavily from films like alien hellraiser and even blade runner the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build up that makes it wonderfully horrifying the story brings us to the year where space travel have since enormously progressed the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man s lifetime the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after years it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune a search and rescue team led by miller fishburne is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon the designer of the ship dr weir neill follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship event horizon is a sci fi horror film much truer to the word than say alien would ever be while in alien the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces in event horizon the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud enough i can t stand this anymore there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also the acting is only at most average by most commercial standards even so the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film thanks to its well paced storytelling disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences which incidentally has been quite generously removed by our censorship board director paul anderson who did mortal kombat and his team of atmosphere creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term horror this picture did not do very well in the us box office most probably for the dread factor impact it has on most audiences people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this although on the face of it event horizon is mostly molded for mass entertainment many thrills spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus however the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the experience of event horizon i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us be forewarned this film is not for the faint hearted nor for pure entertainment be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film event horizon is highly recommended but at your own risk it has been a long time since good horror embraced the big screen and event horizon is one 
how many of us would become strippers for those of us who wouldn t is it a moral reason or purely a lack of confidence that s probably not a fair question and for a lot of us it could very well be for neither of those reasons as you watch the full monty however you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough in case you haven t guessed the full monty is about stripping but striptease it ain t it s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication it is the story of six out of work out of shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless but not without need what to do it hits our main character gaz robert carlyle as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis it seems that simple take it off and bring in the cash eventually gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance these include the overweight confidence lacking dave mark addy the uptight overly officious gerald tom wilkinson the once suicidal lomper steve huison and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition horse paul barber an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy and guy hugo speer a young well endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant when the sextet is complete we re given a hefty dose of physical comedy we watch the bumbling middle aged men choreograph pseudo sexy dance numbers all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place as if there anti appeal wasn t enough they decide to boost interest in the group by promising the full monty on opening night which for us americans means baring it all and i mean all the movie actually ends on opening night a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add it s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater with the subject matter you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel good almost inspiring film but it surprisingly turns out that way the amount of light touching drama also comes as a nice surprise never feeling off balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film there s a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words and the ensemble cast couldn t be better each character is completely individual interesting funny and most importantly real the full monty is never offensive a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness it s one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment perfect for a great night on the town or as a saturday night movie rental either way you see it it shouldn t let you down in the slightest and pun heavily intended when it s all said and done you ll be smiling from cheek to cheek 
a big surprise to me the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi is such a dumb idea i really had no hope they replaced him just fine not with john goodman he didn t do much of anything but with the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant who s ten this was another of my fears for the film but he s a really good dancer and plays a mean harmonica although he may have been dubbed things that intellectually had bothered me before like no mission from god everyone being richer it not being filmed in chicago gave me no problems at all i m quite pleased that there were less car pile ups because they meant less music and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing there s a few early crashes and then one huge pile up but after that it all stops it s just the music one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him but there s no problems with this the music is all as good as ever tons of great musicians showing up with the exception of johnny lang who can t sing all the musicians do a great job the only real problems i had was the special effects these were superfluous and a waste of money since the film isn t doing very well they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel which i want to see the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide http www geocities com hollywood academy remove no spam to reply drive carefully but recklessly mama child s toy the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise peter o toole 
the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider when those observers are joel and ethan coen the surreal becomes bizarre when the life is that of jeff the dude leboswki the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of what sgoingonaroundhere the marvelous sound of the stranger sam elliot s voice over introduces the film at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up the dude jeff bridges is described as the laziest man in los angeles possibly the world although he s not so much slothful as he is relaxed spending the last years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other he doesn t have much of a life but he s having a good time when asked what he does for fun he responds bowl drive around and the occasional acid flashback lebowski s passion is bowling when he s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike things just happen to him arriving home one night he s beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them even worse they urinate on his rug the problem is that the dude doesn t have a wife his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment the big lebowski david huddleston is a multi millionaire and his dudeness lives in two room squalor the next day our ragtag hero visits his namesake s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together not surprisingly since it s virtually the only object there when he s denied any money he picks up a replacement rug off the floor on his way out he runs into lebowski s trophy babe wife bunny tara reid who offers to perform a sexual act that according to rumor is one of bill clinton s favorites for a thousand bucks the penniless dude wisecracks that he s heading for the cash machine later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny s kidnappers this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes gone wrong sequences the kidnappers are impossibly inept the dude and his cronies are even worse every plan goes awry you can almost see lebowski s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues that s the story but to tell the truth it doesn t much matter there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into the dude s bowling buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi look like people you d see on the street but like everything else in this film they re not quite what they seem walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won t admit it walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet donny gets precious few words in between walter s screaming and the dude s rambling when he does walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns donny is out of his league and doesn t have a frame of reference the film is peppered with people for whom the term character would be an understatement the big lebowski s daughter maude an avant garde vaginal artist paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s m mary martin the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler as the flamenco music swells we see him putting on his lavender hose the camera pans up to an all purple skin tight bowling outfit with jesus pronounced with a j not an h embroidered on the pocket he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has i can t think of anyone else who could have done a better job buscemi has a limited role but he plays it perfectly the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he s one of the treasures of our time it s odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr s television husband more like the coen s raising arizona than their hit fargo the big lebowski demands an open mind and even more open eyes a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss there s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it walking out of the theater i felt that the film had something important to say on further examination i wasn t sure exactly what it was if you meet jesus at the bowling alley it s not going to be what you expect when the going gets weird the weird go bowling maybe there s no real message perhaps it s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world maybe that s enough michael redman has written this column for years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about the man in the iron mask starring that favorite of year old girls of all ages redman bvoice com is the eaddress for estuff 
harmless silly and fun comedy about dim witted wrestling fans gordie and sean david arquette and scott caan who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king oliver platt when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter joe pantoliano gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed but not fake mind you the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances which is exactly what a movie like this requires and oliver platt one of my favorite actors is a riot as the drunken washed up ex champion many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record but for me it just added to the silly factor of the film thereby increasing my enjoyment of it one casting complaint however rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer please if rose mcgowan is sexy then i m marilyn manson given the current state of the actual wcw if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming he d be the most popular guy they have on a similar note the plot line of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years although one does have to ask why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans director brian robbins you ll remember him as eric from tv s head of the class just knows how to make good dumb movies this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues and screenwriter steven brill the epic mighty ducks trilogy late last night manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me the only exceptions to that were a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan those moments made me cringe and or groan as an added bonus though the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll pg 
 well this is not mission difficult mr hunt it s mission impossible difficult should be a walk in the park for you agent swanbeck sir anthony hopkins the series new agent phelps takes ethan hunt tom cruise down a notch a russian scientist rade serbedzija has created a new virus and its antidote called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection a rogue imf agent sean ambrose dougray scott wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause posing as ethan hunt ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff hall thandie newton to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods ethan and nyah fall quickly in love but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose s reluctantly he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah although the first mission impossible film was a moderate box office success audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn t much action although being a fan of the series both old and new i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry robert towne and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo the end result is one of the most entertaining yet simple action films made in a long while unfortunately the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah s quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission impossible tv series ethan s conflict is a compelling one but it seems very rushed and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close ups the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film thankfully though at the point ambrose discovers nyah s deception mission impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action packed robert towne s screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus after that the action scenes just begin to build in intensity as is the case with many of woo s previous high octane films the final half hour is an all out assault of action a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer unfortunately as far as summer entertainment goes mission impossible ii is serviceable fare anyone looking for hardcore action won t be disappointed except for during the first half of the film perhaps even if you weren t a fan of the first film this entry deserves some checking out pg 
it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less than savoury character as mel gibson does in payback of course if i was being paid million for one month s work i d probably be willing to take risks as well but that s neither here nor there payback is based on a novel by richard stark apparently actually donald e westlake author of the grifters itself a fine crime film which was also filmed in the s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys lee marvin the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back by whom we don t know yet all we know is that gibson as porter isn t a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back and getting even in the process no matter what the consequences it turns out that the man he s after is val gregg henry his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers porter however is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet goes about exacting revenge on the double crossing val gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn t mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants you probably wouldn t see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat out of character role such as porter jim carrey won t be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried the cable guy anyone harrison ford s idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin which we won t mention further and has stallone ever really played a villain at all this is not to say that porter is a villain per se while he isn t the sort of character you wouldn t want to get on the wrong side of he s nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right hand men just to prove how mean they are porter is only trying to get back what is not so rightfully his which in a way is almost understandable payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy thriller which won t be remembered as being among gibson s most important work but is still one of the finer films he s done the only real problem with it is that while everything seems to work out in the end i was left feeling something was lacking was that all the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute and the final voice over doesn t ring true even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film noir style the rest of the film embodies the film just ends far too suddenly after a huge build up in the penultimate scenes a fine film even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending 
there is a striking scene early in city of angels where all the angels who live unseen in our midst gather at the beach to watch the sun rise the camera moves above them showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women all garbed in black then the camera moves in on the face of seth an angel played by nicolas cage and as the sun rises he smiles and his entire face lights up you see the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets but they cannot feel a human touch it is an important scene for several reasons first of all it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible the film presents these fantastic beings as normal looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth watching what goes on with little interference there are none of the standard hokey angel references used in recent films like angels in the outfield or michael the angels here are stark and believable this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition for its shows how god s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs or the smell of the salt in the air there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel although there is much beauty in it as well they eternally walk the earth listening to our thoughts touching us in our pain and leading the dying to heaven like human existence being an angel is often confused and unsure city of angels is essentially a love story between seth and a human a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan he first sees her when he is in her operating room waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven maggie is distraught doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table and seth is moved by her efforts and more importantly her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain and seth does what he can with his invisible touch but it s not enough he wants to be with her and share her pain not just stand back at a distance he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to fall and become human he learns this from another fallen angel played by dennis franz n y p d blue in a touching and humorous performance sitting at a diner together franz tells cage s character about how wonderful it is to be human to be able to taste food feel another person s skin smell the air and most importantly have a loving wife and children of course there is pain to go along with all this but for seth it will be worth it city of angels is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender s haunting film wings of desire wenders film was more like a poem it was the feeling the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human and unlike most foreign films that are re made into hollywood fare it doesn t suffer extensive damage this may be because director brad silberling casper and screenwriter dana stevens blink wanted to make city of angels its own movie inspired by wings of desire but not an attempt to copy it and yet city of angels is not a typical hollywood movie it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale the english patient whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world seale creates many striking visuals in addition to the beach scene there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by while the film travels along a charted plot it takes time to develop its characters and situations it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly and shows just how thin those boundaries are both cage and ryan give soulful soft spoken performances ryan who is usually so bouncy and energetic truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple heartfelt gazes and speaks with the comforting knowing voice that only an angel could have what is most striking about city of angels is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay which is both unexpected and challenging it s not a formulaic hollywood ending because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time it doesn t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance instead it offers something much better something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive visit charlie don t surf an eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http www bigfoot com jimkendrick e mail jimkendrick bigfoot com 
you ve seen this moment before recently a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor s nell in the haunting we don t care the hero of the sixth sense a young boy named cole is a rich creation and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike the seasons have changed since an ex patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe willis in the comfort of his own bedroom desperate to get his career back on track even at the expense of his crumbling marriage to williams of rushmore malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole osment the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm s would be killer scars on his body antisocial behaviour and the reluctance to reveal a big secret only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies and hospitalized as a result does he divulge to malcolm in a spine tingling scene that he sees dead people walking among us all the time malcolm assumes and given his profession reasonably so that cole is schizophrenic not psychic but the sincerity in cole s anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures he will instead pursue the supernatural angle becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole who lives with his single mother lynn collette in the process the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist though shyamalan does somewhat unforgiveably crib the self rearranging kitchen business from the latter it s far more heartwarming than frightening and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown but they re not out to harm him really they just want to be heard even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us at first than they really are because we re looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight year old that s right willis for the first time in years gives up the spotlight to his costar we appreciate malcolm s domestic dilemma but we identify with cole recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed both actors deliver immensely likable performances and their dynamic is manifest willis convinces us that he s a doctor something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night osment is phenomenal a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do the sixth sense atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs cinematographer tak fujimoto is actually a drama its spooky effective ad campaign is misleading only because i was expecting something different did i notice rather feel the movie s running time which is just shy of two hours the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait i m not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof but i admired its audacity 
when i left the theater after seeing david lynch s lost highway i remarked to a fellow movie goer i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears in his first feature film in five years lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture eraserhead on the weirdness scale you won t know what happened when it s over though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses it is difficult to describe the plot of this film because it depends partly on how you interpret it i can however describe what we see on the screen l a jazz saxophonist fred madison bill pullman and his wife renee patricia arquette whom he clearly suspects of infidelity receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep they are naturally enough more than a little frightened and confused and it doesn t help matters any when mystery man robert blake approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving the next morning fred finds another videotape which to his and our surprise shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton balthazar getty the perplexed prison officials release dayton whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways most notably his affair with alice wakefield arquette again a blonde who is otherwise renee s spitting image and another encounter with the mystery man i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more but suffice it to say that lynch doesn t offer any neat wrap ups nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion the cinematic demons of lost highway are out in full force from beginning to end this description might make lost highway sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism but in fact while there are traces of lynch s weird sense of humor this film is anything but giddy most of the time on the contrary lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery rather the character is the mystery there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion distrust and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings on here we the audience are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this probably fred s in my opinion and what in that case the other characters and events are meant to represent all of this proceeds appropriately in lynch s typically slow paced idiosyncratic style as is often the case lynch relies on sound imagery and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story and in lost highway it works perfectly there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil s song to the siren can be heard faintly in the background nothing is technically happening in these scenes yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as if not more so than the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity lynch s direction and director of photography pete deming s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story well most of the time anyway i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer s attention because of its tie ins to the original mystery the main characters in this reality dayton a well meaning but none too intelligent year old a sleazy gangster who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character and his porn star girlfriend the blond arquette are nothing you couldn t find in any of the two dozen pulp fiction wannabes fortunately the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements such as the strained awkward conversations between pete and his parents help to preserve the film s spooky unnerving tone during this stretch lynch s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery are also somewhat overdone here it s not exactly exploitative like almost everything else in this film the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off that said these minor flaws don t prevent lost highway from attaining its place as one of the darkest most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years it is a one way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind and as such it is gripping intense and brilliantly effective 
the latest epos from lars is a blast although a rather moody one this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the something the church calvinistic is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower they are considered being too unrestrained in these surroundings we find the to be weds jan and bess played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess is just bess a bit naive and innocent in every aspect of the word at first at the wedding party we are told an anecdote illustrating her infinite kindness she once lend a bike to an stranger her best friends bike however but bess is suffering in this scary religious society we soon take part in a funeral where a man fallen off the orthodox path is laid to rest while doomed to hell women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend almost manic that her friends try to calm her down a bit the time has come when jan is to return to the rig bess is falling into the darkness of depression her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves she can t stand the thought of life without her husband we witness her dialogues with god she speaks both parts paranoia convincing god to return jan from the oilrig and her prayers are heard an accident on the rig bring him back paralysed from the neck and down now he can t satisfy her need for physical love he try to persuade her into finding a lover with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail at first she resist but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply imagine what this is doing to the poor girl the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby accompanied by music from the era procol harum deep purple t rex and others the use of hand held camera and lack of any make up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant though a bit too gloomy for my taste i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue le matin and bitter moon lunes de fiel emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances this must be the reason for giving it the grand prix du jury in cannes this year although we had hoped for the palme d or the screenplay is now available in print the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july just in time for the danish premiere 
did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra terrestrial i used to think that about my th grade english teacher ms carey but after seeing this movie they may have confirmed my suspicions as the story goes at any time there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth the men in black mib are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens guardians of our beloved planet from nasty tempered aliens and secret service to the stars based in new york city where weird is the norm the mib organization gives human form to our space faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed but to enforce the laws of earth the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast they carry other worldly technology to erase people s short term memory when common folk see the mib in action and their best leads on cosmic things gone awry are the supermarket tabloids little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v evil going on in the depths of space one of the aliens as human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious it holds the key literally to universal peace a giant cockroach like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this key in the wrong alien hands flippers mandibles tentacles it can be used as a weapon therefore it must be recovered and returned to it s rightful owners otherwise to ensure universal safety earth will be destroyed along with the key now it s the mib who must prevent this catastrophe the mib agents on the case are k played by tommy lee jones he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes he is accompanied by a flippant rookie j played by will smith but despite this shoot em up protect earth from destruction premise this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie and this isn t an independence day knockoff rather this is a stylishly offbeat sci fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies that there are real aliens that live here and that the government does its darndest to cover them up but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe there must be some kind of earth hangs in the balance scenario yet this movie is very appealing the abundance of wierdness talking aliens pee wee atomizers a mortician who lives for her work and lots of yucky bugs and slime splattering galore is played straight like as if this were normal of course we are in nyc it gives it a deadpan feel which makes it all the more funnier and odder jones plays the venerable seen it all agent with seriousness and maturity smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones straight man routine they click like dorothy s ruby red shoes the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld the addam s family this guy has a knack for gothic comedy and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen and an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors the story moves well and before you know it the end credits are already rolling the result is minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs aaaahhhs and wows let the men in black protect and color your world 
part one of the strangest movies ever made series at www mediajunkies com by scott watson light spoilers nothing you shouldn t read existenz has been called a gooey matrix and while this is a correct description in some ways in others it is completely off the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal real reality a major difference is that the matrix has a base reality that is obviously the true reality while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true and oh what a reality it is david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies naked lunch crash but this one is one of the strangest maybe it s because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre technology is organic but only some of it cars are normal gas stations are the same cell phones are glowing bug like appendages you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus referred to simply as a pod high technology has been replaced with organic creatures and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters a famous game designer allegra geller a fine looking jennifer jason leigh flees a demonstration of her latest game existenz after an assassination attempt she is on the run from who i m still not sure and has to save her pod by playing her game with someone friendly that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard ted pikul jude law unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing a bioport sort of a hole in your spine ok exactly like a hole in your spine a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail looking wires from the pod into you allowing you to play the game luckily a bioport can be installed easily they install them in malls so off they go to get one after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station they are able to plug in and play existenz the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies reality distortion chinese restaurants and multi appendaged amphibian things it s a sign of the times but the plot while cohesive in it s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe cronenberg just slaps this weird organic tech world into the viewers lap and it s up to you to figure out how all these things work and that s the true joy of this film entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place you learn a little bit piece by piece oh they make pods out of those and it s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover there s lots of little things that set off the weird o meter like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store the two headed amphibian creature and why that guy at the gas station s name appears to be gas it all adds up to a supremely far out trip and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix s virtual world oh wait i already do 
 the fugitive is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made it takes realistic believable characters and tells an exciting story that s totally believable throughout this isn t an over the top action flick for the sake of action this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly harrison ford stars as dr richard kimble a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder but is not told in a straightforward manner we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble s perspective hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble s wife helen sela ward was murdered we don t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story in fact we might even have a little doubt about kimble s innocence ourselves the film doesn t spend much time on the details of kimble s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated it is actually suspenseful to watch this movie is so incredible because it s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard a u s marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other most of the film deals with richard s complex investigation as he tries to find the one armed man who killed his wife ford does not have a lot of lines here so it is stuart and twohy s script and davis s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits disguising himself and doing his own detective work is very interesting we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed so as he learns more so do we meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues but richard is just too smart for them he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo pantoliano and biggs roebuck they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer yet they constantly start up small talk with each other making funny wisecracks and one liners but not in any kind of distracting manner the final act concludes with another terrific chase richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him and although we get a typical fight scene the case is far from solved the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along and we don t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together maybe the finally scene is a bit much but it still has a believable atmosphere to it we re so relieved when justice is served it s not the plot is that makes the fugitive great it s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous if only hollywood could produce more movies like this see also nick of time 
larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner publisher of the multi million dollar hustler publications company the people vs larry flynt is the story of larry flynt s fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine hustler based on a true story the film is almost a documentary in that it s a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt s life woody harrelson gives an excellent performance he conveys flynt s peculiarities and his character with depth and focus by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves somewhat grudgingly liking larry flynt this is some feat given flynt s apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court however flynt has a number of things going for him he s rich he s funny and most importantly he says exactly what he means larry flynt s wife althea leasure is played by courtney love larry meets althea at one of his clubs and they fall in love a very sexual and open love both of them indulge in a world of too much sex and eventually too much drugs flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down which was especially upsetting for him by an assassin althea had joined him in taking the drugs following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs althea does not have any such plans nor the determination to follow them as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea s situation as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect it s extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away edward norton plays flynt s lawyer alan isaacman again this is a solid performance the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt s courtroom antics flynt is not only childish in the courtroom but downright rude to the judges and lands himself in a lot of trouble and even in a mental institution because of it isaacman is very easy to like and great at proving in quite clever ways his points to the court milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs larry flynt it is not really an exciting or thrilling film but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story due to larry s character it is also at times a very funny film however it is much more than that it is about the fight for freedom of speech anti censorship and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy an excellent look at flynt his life and his story keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey 
the question isn t why has grease been reissued the answer to that one is easy to celebrate the movie s th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount s coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity no the question that ought to be asked is should grease be reissued the answer is not an easy one grease is a fun movie an entertaining fantasy of the s embodying all the cliches of that era the music is lively and the dance numbers choreographed by patricia birch are energetic and high spirited travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon cool but non threatening but grease didn t break any new cinematic ground it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider what grease is or has become is the highest grossing musical in film history ok let s not be a spoilsport grease is a fun and entertaining movie even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta olivia newton john taxi s jeff conaway and the multi talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers it s nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was and it s sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly cinematically the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur between grease and s evita you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated no make that cynical and jaded today if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight he or she would probably be hooted off the screen today s audiences lack the innocence that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed secondly a lack of talent performers with the charisma the style the larger than life panache of fred astaire gene kelly ginger rogers and judy garland are gone most singers and dancers remain on the stage and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts a good example is gregory hines one of the greatest dancers in the world he danced a bit in the cotton club tap and white nights but those were essentially dramatic vehicles so perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose if audiences show enough interest meaning if the re release earns the studio enough revenue it may spark a revival in movie musicals perhaps not original musicals such as singin in the rain an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years at one time or another according to the industry rumor mill hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber s cats a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago the latter reportedly to star madonna so let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals let grease be the word that sparks this revival 
ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon the book of the dead bruce campbell stars as ash who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods and his friends who have become demons including his own girlfriend the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film s tiny budget constant location changes and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years followed by two sequels evil dead ii and army of darkness the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it s original aspect ratio of the disc contains two versions of the film s audio a stereo track and a newly remastered dolby digital included are two separate running commentary tracks the first features writer director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film s star bruce campbell campbell s commentary is informative and extremely witty as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film such informative tidbits include the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead and in fact when the film premiered in that was it s title and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard also there s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they ve found that s explaining about the demonic forces in the woods for that scene it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana so being the wacky kids that they were at the time they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor s had never smoked before and as a result they became confused and were unable to perform the scene i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi rob tapert audio track the two people you d think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all don t get me wrong here when they do speak it s entertaining to hear but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask have anything to say sam to me that s not a good sign also it seems like sam raimi doesn t remember much about the film and it s production well compared to rob and bruce anyway also included on the disc is a photo gallery which includes pictures from the film s gala premiere and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques overall the evil dead is a good low budget horror film superior to many films in it s genre and the collector s edition dvd release is well worth your time if you re either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining 
it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival s palme d or a million plus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented film maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly as a co director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn in between he has moonlighted as an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performances now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard s novel rum punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed for the most part jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie the story which starts out slowly develops into a twisty affair with double crosses and triple crosses and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire s pop tunes and close ups of womens bare feet yet for all of that the production is something of a letdown the sheer in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent the mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn t match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino s previous efforts an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives and there aren t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around there s a samuel l jackson monologue about guns a jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk and a jackson robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that s about it jackie brown s lone innovation is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives this isn t exactly an original technique it has been done numerous times before most famously in akira kurosawa s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick s courage under fire however while in those two movies and others there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points of view tarantino s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it s unconventional had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages nothing would have been lost as a result this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity for the second picture in a row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a s icon this time around instead of john travolta it s blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown has become jackie brown in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier s career tarantino uses a s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre although grier never does any butt kicking grier is jackie brown a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states she s working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel l jackson but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton a federal official no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for a bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tv s banyon to post the necessary then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal jackie passes ordell s test however and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle of ordell s money into the united states without tipping off the feds soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordell s perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert de niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l jackson but ordell isn t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction in addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get a nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guys who rarely smile roles bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons to look sexy in a bikini to provide a little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantino s foot fetish robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middle aged actor the film which clocks in at several minutes over the two and a half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout although the payoff is a letdown tarantino keeps things moving along nicely with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself when it comes to recent caper films like the grifters and bound jackie brown is a second tier effort it s an entertaining diversion but not a masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender 
robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire one with class and style the film set in old detroit in the year stars peter weller as murphy a lieutenant on the city s police force s detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor security concepts inc whose employees the cops are threatening to strike to make matters worse a savage group of cop killers has been terrorizing the city on murphy s first day of duty after his transfer from another precinct these cop killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m p a a after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead s c i recruits his remains for their new robocop program using the remains of murphy s body as a foundation their scientists build a cyborg made of both flesh and metal the cyborg robocop is half human murphy and half robot the s c i engineers have erased murphy s memory and replaced it with a computer program or so they think with his lightning quick reflexes immense strength and impenetrable armor s c i envisions robocop as an indestructible super cop the solution to detroit s problems the remainder of the plot follows robocop s crime foiling and vengeance on his murderers as a science fiction action thriller robocop is extremely effective dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense shocking gore and spectacular special effects several sequences in the film such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist are destined to become cult classics because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience in other words in a movie theater although the special effects and action are exciting they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre rather robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative terrorism board games and television news broadcasts with air headed anchors these news broadcasts which are exceptionally clever recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore the satire in robocop however is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood s america as portrayed in the film may seem far fetched but is in actuality i think only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction social commentary unfortunately robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior the terminator and aliens robocop s main problem aside from its dumb title is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy s character we never learn the degree to which murphy as robocop is human and the degree to which he is a robot does murphy have any human spirit or free will left or is he merely a computer following a program the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action moreover it almost completely ignores the question and tragedy of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine robocop also contains several bothersome loose ends as you watch robocop you experience deja vu you feel as if you have seen the film before in many respects robocop is reminiscent of several other films including the terminator return of the jedi and even death wish however to its credit robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip off 
when jim henson passed away he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success it now seems hinged on his input jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially but as the last two muppet films or that silly computer generated monkey from lost in space demonstrate the thrill and genius are gone i m not sure the dark crystal made today would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe filled response an all powerful crystal has cracked causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings the big gentle mystics and the vulture like skeksis the mystics send jen a naive gelfling boy on a mission to find the shard that cracked away which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers before the great conjunction of three suns along the way jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive the rebecca demornay like kira an ogre witch named aughra who removes her eyes to look at things and a spastic but friendly tumbleweed like animal named fizzgig much of the beauty in the dark crystal which is a simple tale though it does not condescend to any viewer lies in its art direction and creature design the puppeteering is phenomenal observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute or the landwalker chase but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture a delicately narrated by john baddeley absorbing prologue the voice work in the film by muppet regulars and irregulars is tone perfect as well trevor jones score should not be discounted it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character i suppose due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature that it couldn t be helped but i wish the film was longer jen and kira have wonderful well chemistry and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated the dark crystal has a very small cult following the weaker labyrinth is probably better known which is upsetting a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth s creatures due to the financial failure of people less the dark crystal that film never quite found its footing it played like an acid trip episode of the muppet show with david bowie as guest host borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien s fan base i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public the dark crystal deserved and still deserves a bigger audience it s the best kind of children s entertainment elegant fantastical and courageously un hip brian henson fortunate son keep looking back at this your father s masterpiece 
virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre since dark city films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix all the films released after it have been less successful david cronenberg s existenz released only a couple of months after the matrix was accepted and even appreciated by some but the hype was gone and when the thirteenth floor aired this fall it was completely overseen and ignored i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying feeling like eating the same meal over and over again it was therefore i was less than excited when i went out to see to the thirteenth floor however i was positively surprised by josef rusnak s latest picture matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality combining the best of hollywood s action and effects with an intelligent story existenz was a violent gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality ending in blood and madness the thirteenth floor is somewhere in between instead of going after the crowds the action audience like the matrix or aiming at the horror fans like existenz the thirteenth floor presents a more intelligent plot witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding in a near future on the thirteenth floor of a classified building a genius scientist hannon fuller has created a simulated world his personal dreamworld where every inhabitant is a complex selflearning program that only believes it is real right after the first testing of this world fuller is found murdered douglas hall his closest friend and business partner immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth a beautiful woman gretchen mol who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence the first download into simulation is impressive it is the creator s first visit to his world his creation in order to enter this virtual universe you have to take over someone s identity become another person this is called conciseness transfer and this is part of the tragedy in the film people wake up in unknown places and strange things start happen they start to doubt in their own sanity these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their users and creators with their sanity and their lives it is a frightening reality the fact that all the people in the simulation the program links are living out their lives oblivious not knowing that they are puppets in someone s fantasy with an appealing blade runner type of detective story this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present our modern world is metal and glass cold unfriendly impersonal the thirties are different colorful beautiful elegant virile this contrast demonstrates a wish for change virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise to some a personal playground a life without any consequences for others a way to start over and correct their mistakes by living in an illusion of their past virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes dreams and fantasies to life at least that s how it is all beginning but when you re waking up from your dream the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise this almost narcotic effect soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised what is real what is thought who are we if these were answered this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made they are off course not answered but posed in an intelligent manner the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements since it portrays the contrast between these computer simulated universes kirk m petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour grace and color and setting this world in opposition to our own an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time a rather unusual thing about the thirteenth floor is the almost complete lack of special effects there are no cgi animated creatures no bullets in slow motion this is a more philosophical approach reminding about the european way of filmmaking this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians but the more serious science fiction buffs and dark city fans will be pleased this film is interesting and inspiring it has everything existenz doesn t but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix and then there is a happy end which like in dark city completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics including blade runner and dark city with this in mind the thirteenth floor doesn t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now yet this is a beautiful elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality

david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head it is one of many science fiction films released during the last year of this millenium that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future the story unfolds in a near future where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs the world of the future is an unfriendly place where the scared inhabitants are hiding in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world allegra geller jennifer jason leigh the leading game designer in the world is testing her new virtual reality game existenz with a focus group as they begin she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun she flees with a young marketing trainee ted pikul jude law who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard unfortunately her pod an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program is damaged to inspect it she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her the events leading up to this and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn t exist as the players are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game s perspective i don t intend to reveal more of the film s premise which is structured as a computer game with tasks that the characters must complete to win the game released after the matrix and dark city existenz has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films however existenz is moving in a different direction with a premise of its own a combination of dazzling special effects brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot made the matrix a rare and entertaining science fiction experience with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade existenz has a completely different atmosphere resembling dark city which is darker more serious and less entertaining existenz has the opportunities and potential but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored after the engaging beginning it starts to falter while i was watching the film many left the theatre during the first hour and indeed existenz seemed as a complete failure the actors seemed unreal the plot and dialogue silly unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level explaining all past events the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes and jet the film fails on several issues probably the best written character in the story is a game designer who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world than face real life this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg s script to the limits but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for it s a cold dark place where the players are forced to interrelate with unreal characters eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will it doesn t look like a place worth even thinking about david cronenberg has been the creator of the fly videodrome and the dead zone so it s not so hard to guess that existenz is a violent and gory film besides the regular murders of innocent people the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two headed mutated amfibium scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures the way i see it this is the film s crucial failure it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time space and problems of our everyday life do not exist a place of blooming blossoms green forests and clear waters a place really worth sacrificing your life for because of its lack of three dimensionality the film looses most of its possibilities but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes amusing performances especially by willem dafoe and one interesting and important thought depicted in many different ways throughout the movie during the film the audience is as confused as the characters detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created the matrix despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts ends with a light at the end of the tunnel existenz does not it is a one time experience ending in blood gore and madness a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow 
the s produced two brilliant science fiction films one was gattaca the other was the thirteenth floor just as gattaca was overshadowed by the mighty titanic the thirteenth floor was relegated to obscurity by the matrix however the thirteeth floor though it deals with similar themes is a much better movie than the frenetic childish and improbable matrix a cutting edge computer scientist hannon fuller played by the charming armin mueller stahl is murdered his associate douglas hall craig bierko apparently framed and suspected by the police enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery along the way a beautiful blonde gretchen mol more bodies and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture the thirteenth floor unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view first its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline second and more seriously it demands that its audience think and feel no wonder it fell through the cracks done in film noir style as a murder mystery this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels many audiences will simply be bewildered by it rather than engaged which is a shame because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie despite its philosophical challenges the thirteenth floor derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller mol and douglas hall bierko as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller in that sense it is more akin to gattaca than the matrix which for all of its cute philosophical byplay is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying wrenching and intellectually challenging in its final moments the film even takes on itself when david jane s husband who has come to enjoy killing accuses her of being the sick one although there is a victory for the leading characters this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane and thus a deep seated character flaw in fact hannon fuller s activities in the simulated world the behavior of jane s husband and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil the tragedy is not in their stars but in themselves the major actors all of whom are required to play two or even three roles perform extremely well bierko who will be familiar as the psycho from the long kiss goodnight is outstanding d onofrio as whitney who plays a pivotal role in support also turns in a good performance the lovely gretchen mol whose elegance integrity and determination suggest bergman in casablanca does a wonderful job her voice however lacks the necessary weight at times this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script some minor flaws hairline cracks in fine porcelain appear in places there are one or two instances of jerky editing the script takes the edge off the film s climaxes the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times yet there is a clue there too one wonders if even after two decades blade runner is still casting its long shadow over sci fi films one can see a group of suits in their suite waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in amadeus make it more like blade runner you know dark and rainy the thirteen floor is that rare exception among hollywood movies a rich emotionally satisfying intelligent sci fi movie and yet ultimately it proves the suits right for when good sci fi is made where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it if we don t support great sf who will 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned floating life australia s first ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category its dialogue is in cantonese english and german marks a special accomplishment by clara law a compelling at times poignant film it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama floating life centers around a hong kong family s sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong and is divided into clearly defined vignettes each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses which serves to emphasize the film s theme of family the film opens with mr and mrs chan edwin pang cecilia fong sing lee and their two teen sons toby wong toby chan leaving the bustling claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing annie yip in australia with their spacious immaculately white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one and with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life killer dogs poisonous spiders dangerous ultraviolet rays a frightening one this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing s domineering of her newly reunited family setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family meanwhile elder daughter yen annette shun wah happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter begins to suffer an identity crisis manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under among the dramatic threads of floating life this is perhaps the most effective and engaging with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming anthony wong left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting his is an uncompelling character and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm which quickly becomes tedious ms law s film cheerfully embraces melodrama each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn t help but find reminiscent to wayne wang s acutely unsubtle the joy luck club but despite the director s rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings i couldn t help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and in dramatic terms is certainly the highlight of floating life floating life at times spreads itself too thin given the myriad of characters involved it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters however it is a fine film with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling ching fong and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non actors special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee annette shun wah and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming s girlfriend from vancouver floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together which are able to withstand great distances and new environments 
after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard out steps a steel gray human like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit spencer the boy who observes this having seen his fill of science fiction flicks figures this thing must be a robot from outer space with the exception of disney and a few others most studios view children s films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit star kid stands out as that rare kids film that is undoubtedly low budget but is also highly imaginative remember the robot it wasn t one at all but rather a phase one assault cyborsuit the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit and the cyborsuit nicknamed cy has plenty of spunk cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like cool upon hearing that command cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop and when cy speaks we see spencer s view the backside of cy s lips and eyes as year old spencer joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue tied kid even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit he has his fears but he learns to overcome them if you run away things don t get better whether it s bullies spiders or girls his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three turbo joey simmrin the school s chubby bully beats up on him spiders frighten him and most embarrassing of all he can t speak when in the presence of his would be girlfriend with his cyborsuit on he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey played by a smart mouthed ashlee levitch who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker stacey derides her brother whom she barely tolerates by referring to him only as the fungus this whole setup for spencer s downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment the beauty of mazzello s performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he ll not soon forget the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire michelle lauren eckstrom his eyes open wide in revulsion mate with her spencer exclaims pllllleeeeease i just like her that s all the show has many funny twists in one cy sees a man in a barney like costume and begins firing at him thinking he is an alien life form soon things get way out of hand and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat as proof positive of the show s class it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor thought that was an oxymoron in a kids picture didn t you cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious the director s staging of this sequence is one of the film s more charming moments oh and eating is pretty funny too spencer whose idol is the comic book character midknight warrior gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit spencer s valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition for a family movie mixing humor fantasy and action star kid delivers although it s probably not the sort of movie you d want to see without kids with them you ll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story you ll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through star kid runs it is rated pg for fantasy combat although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up and possibly the younger ones my son jeffrey age got really excited about the picture he called it an especially good movie and gave it when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully 
unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric ostensibly the film is a documentary but use of that term requires stretching its meaning many scenes appear staged and a great deal of cutting and pasting has been done in the editing room the cinema verite effect is a conceit genuine spontaneity is at a premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera especially would be actresses like cindy crawford director douglas keeve who was mizrahi s lover at the time freely admits that he couldn t care less about the truth but was more interested in capturing the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion despite violating nearly every rule of legitimate documentary film making however unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment while it sheds only a little light on the behind the scenes world of the fashion industry it presents a fascinating if incomplete picture of designer mizrahi this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study he s funny energetic and eminently quotable he has unusual views on just about everything from fashion it s about women not wanting to look like cows to mary tyler moore between her and jackie kennedy they shaped this country to style it s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress it s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection in particular unzipped traces mizrahi s development of his fall line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show which highlights a number of prominent models including cindy crawford naomi campbell kate bush and linda evangelista on the technical side a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped a variety of film stocks were used super mm black and white and mm color there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie and during the climactic fashion show color is used to show the audience s perspective while black and white is for the behind the scenes sequences nevertheless some viewers will be put off by this treatment while unzipped isn t an expose on the fashion industry per se keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear overall however this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed when the designer declares that everything is frustrating except designing clothes that s beautiful and liberating it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed 
 gattaca represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science fiction films it s a genre picture that doesn t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color intelligence and life span they d like for their child and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects those made the old fashioned way are labeled as in valids and confined to the lower rung of society vincent freeman ethan hawke is one such person born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish molded younger brother anton fed up with being second rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation everyday he watches as superior folk make his fantasy a reality determined to do the same vincent meets a dna broker tony shalhoub in a funny cameo who sells fake identities to in valids his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow jude law an ex athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life for a price and the promise of a caretaker jerome supplies vincent with his identity as well as blood skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on the job tests and physical examinations this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card because of his drastically improved status vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca and catches the eye of comely co worker irene uma thurman on the way obsessed with her own minor heart defect she s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn t know is a lie but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure the mission director is murdered two ardent detectives alan arkin and billy bathgate s loren dean determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca and the sole clue they find at the crime scene one of vincent s eyelashes threatens to blow vincent s cover and derail his goal even if gattaca were dramatically empty it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials the film s look is dazzling without ever being flashy first time director writer andrew niccol he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama the truman show demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy retro ambiance an opening credits sequence where skin nail and hair fragments fall in slow motion through a colored camera lens displays these combined talents uncannily niccol even utilizes voice over narration a device almost always poorly employed in an effective way when it comes to acting the movie is also flawless ethan hawke does magnificent work proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side but needfully so adding to the setting s clinical chill as the bitter jerome jude law has a star making presence and it s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core in gattaca s series of final shots the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other and the effect is sad lyrical and beautiful things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax when vincent s relationship with his brother comes back into view the big dramatic culmination is a swim race which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed still the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop it s successful sci fi without showy special effects it s a crisp thriller with character driven thrills it s a futuristic fable without blood and guts even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage although it s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim gattaca serves up one of the most thought provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film 
near the end of analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king the following year saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia at best that s all it was a sleeper hit designed to surprise but not shake the industry in however things have been decidedly different there have been a number of pushes on disney s death grip on the market and fifty one weeks into a new champion has emerged dreamworks the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed the other two contenders warner brothers quest for camelot and disney s own annual entry mulan lacked inspiration and drive respectively although camelot was borderline abysmal and can t really be considered a shot at the title mulan had the makings of winner unfortunately it was saturated with traditional disney cute animation and lost points against the rapidly changing face of the competition in making the prince of egypt dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product the animation is flawless and aside from a bug s life is the best looking movie to date the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects and the d d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with the key to success however was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot namely some of the most important action sequences like the parting of the red sea were done almost entirely in d dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ve got the stuff of success and that they re capable of challenging disney the story is also well written and the characters voiced with talent for the most part the plot follows its source material the book of exodus although only in the most general sense the writers took a few creative liberties and most do not damage the story in any way in fact the shakespearean relationship between moses val kilmer and the pharaoh rameses ralph fiennes makes the story more interesting if anything moses a hebrew is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile he floats into the pharaoh seti patrick stewart s palace and is taken in by the royal family moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves by this time rameses is now pharaoh and the two brothers now on opposite sides of the line face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention the cast of voices is most impressive and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock jeff goldblum danny glover and steve martin the script does not have a lot of one liners in it and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams but overall the story is exciting and interesting it s decidedly for an older crowd and the tykes who haven t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost but for those who make the bid the prince of egypt can be a great watch 
capsule a rock and roll fable indeed like a hubert selby jr novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen and a ton of fun streets of fire bills itself as a rock and roll fable and the description is perfect this is a stylish great looking and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby jr novel with a damon runyan rewrite irected by bruce springsteen noir is one of the few truly american movie genres aside from the hollywood musical and the western this is post wwii brooklyn noir for lack of a better label with a generous injection of rock n roll and an all around confrontational attitude it all works the plot is simplicity itself rocker ellen aim diane lane is kidnapped by a vicious street gang led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven willem dafoe very nasty her old soldier flame played by michael pare comes back into town to save her but doesn t count on a whole bunch of things going askew that s about the entire plot save for the spats with ellen s manager a hilarious rick moranis an encounter with a doo wop group that winds up becoming ellen s supporting act and a whole gang of other fun little touches but in movies like this when is the plot important the movie is all style all visuals and attitudes quotable lines and posturing and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing no surprise that it was directed by walter hill hrs who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly and has put together a movie that s a mixture of times and sensibilities but perfectly unified in tone when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw and passes out every minutes on cue streets of fire isn t the greatest movie ever made but it occupies a totally unique little niche and enjoys the position it has anyone with a weakness for doo wop neon motorcycles rainy streets the el studebakers gang pictures lonely heroes and a great looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up i did 
the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes and the greedy trade federation has used it s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo s ruler the young queen amidala natalie portman to sign a treaty giving the federation control however the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui gon jinn liam neeson and obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi and the first battle begins it seems that for me and thousands of people like me the love for george lucas s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time we re the fans not the freaks we won t go dressing up like darth vader although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool and we won t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations not all the time anyway but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest we re throwing down all right stop looking at me like that we have been faithfully and patiently waiting waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll you see the trilogy is not just a set of movies but a religion of sorts to we the faithful disciples and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah unfortunately it is not our savior for weeks beforehand i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good stupendously good miraculously good anything less and it ll be the biggest disappointment of the century i didn t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true really i didn t but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking character development is virtually nonexistent with the possible exception of qui gon most of the film s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions none seem very affected by their experiences and few even show any passion at all contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala jar jar s life is saved by qui gon early in the film and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh or supposedly so his speech mannerisms are so cute ified that i couldn t understand a third of what he was saying and the slapstick he performed was just distracting his head gets caught in an electronic field his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast he describes being in trouble as deep doo doo and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors in star wars we had obi wan telling us mos eisley was a wretched hive of scum and villainy in the phantom menace we get doo doo the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story a long time ago in a galaxy far far away this film on the other hand constantly reminds me that it s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition it s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy like play by play i liked the pod race it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction this aspect coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all didn t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in over and over again didn t the action figures still sell like hotcakes of course they did and it s only poor judgment that allows the most eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults one aspect that will appeal broadly however is the use of special effects the people at lucas s industrial light and magic the world s premiere effects house outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer generated images and real life footage some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed especially the shots of a land battle between the federation s robot army and jar jar s countrymen the space battles are also impressive although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer this however is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today john williams is back of course providing a score for the film as only he can his music is pervasive throughout as rousing and as dramatic as ever always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine episode story star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four five and six respectively the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar as a result attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi wan for example but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films one of the new characters is darth maul hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film s release in spite of the hype darth maul is a character which almost didn t have to be in the film his role is so insignificant he has maybe three spoken lines believe it or not a second actor voices the character and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean with that working against him he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe something which has been prominent throughout however he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible offering an easy out for story writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real life connection oddly while trying to capitalize on spirituality lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force loving parasites in your body s cells this only serves to de mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection don t let me mislead you too far the phantom menace by most standards is a good film it contains a lot of visual treats sets the stage for an epic story gives us a bit of excitement here and there and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends it s just that when held up to it s predecessors and to not do so would be unrealistic this film simply pales 
seen september at p m at the sony nickelodeon theaters boston ma theater with matt perreault for free using my sony loews critic s pass theater rating okay seats sound and picture modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before from teenage sitcoms to nc rated films about fetishes the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it your friends and neighbors takes a different approach as it s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer director neil labute s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story firstly and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex detailed story of lust betrayal arrogance hypocrisy greed and just plain stupidity between six different characters three men three women without hardly any supporting characters a few have a line or two mostly extras everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full circle back to themselves whether it be positive or negative but to just state this is arbitrary and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult labute s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat but what s specifically impressive is the fact the characters names are never revealed until the end credits roll for the sake of this review i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus we re always able to tell where the characters are someone s home the gym a restaurant hotel room etc but what the city they live in what year it is what the society is like etc is relatively unknown the film is a complete character study with the tight intense drama of the theater no one plot dominates the story which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background we re simply dropped in on the characters lives and are expected to figure out the rest the characters are a group of middle class white people who are all successful at what they do but they re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives first there s barry eckhart and mary brenneman a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don t know what they re problem is barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife and the sex they have but doesn t have a lot of ambition he just follows everyone else mary is a writer of some sort but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character but ironically doesn t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something labute s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two obviously this is the theme which is enhanced by the actors good performances but at the same time seems just a bit hollow another couple is jerry stiller and terri keener who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time yet they constantly argue over anything and everything their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship if only one aspect of the film could use improvement it would be this area it s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together what did they ever see in the other person to begin with labute never really answers but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process it still makes for good drama tension and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it s fascinating two other characters act as catalysts cary jason patric and cheri natassja kinski cary is an arrogant hostile sex maniac who defines the word bastard somehow he is able to bend women to his will either through charm or just attitude into getting his way he s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he s secretly perverted but somehow barry finds comfort in his company although jerry is always nervous around him patric gives an outstanding performance so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different from becoming involved in a relationship with one to brushing it off as small talk with another to being outright appalled by yet another she s a sweet woman perhaps the most normal of any of the characters and although her symbolism is obvious her role as the outsider is the most relatable i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others action as that s the hook of the film the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each s scenarios but it s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom the result is sometimes surprising other times predictable but the actual course of actions is always fascinating for a while everyone has their fun but ultimately each character s guilt attitude or ignorance will disserve them one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be since the characters only interact with each other there isn t much pop culture references as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it are we to assume that these people are as the title states our friends and neighbors i don t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie but what this film does have that the others don t is repercussions in the end although the film creates its own reality it goes to show that even the immoral aren t immortal in what way your friends and neighbors is supposed to work is open to interpretation it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically still it s an accomplishment in film making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective 
capsule a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs it lets us see some new dinosaurs is that an oxymoron and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious i had a good time low to here goes my credibility this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority i liked the third jurassic park film i even liked the second jurassic park film in a lot of ways jurassic park the lost world was a creative three way braiding together of michael crichton s novel the lost world arthur conan doyle s novel the lost world and the classic silent film version of the doyle jp was an adventure as doyle said for the boy who s half man or the man who s half boy that is what all the jurassic park films are expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon s mines had under written characters also jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require i feel i got my money s worth the story opens with eric played by trevor morgan and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park they hope no doubt to get a look at the island s dinosaurs from a safe height the height is safe but driving the boat in the water is not the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant sam neill in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple william h macy and tea leoni who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once right guess what happens next jp probably functions better as a sequel than jp first it has alan grant and ellie sattler laura dern back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm sattler has a much smaller part in jp but is still present to tie this story to the first curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films of course these raptors look a little different also so perhaps they are a different related species not only are they more intelligent than in the past films they are also more sympathetic in this story they are not just killing machines they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs of course in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus but larger and presumably more nasty it has a crocodile s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs sometimes they just move too fast to see occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision a few times we get unconvincing matte shot particularly of the laboratory but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams s score for the first film joe johnston who directs already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay the film they have made is a long way from great cinema but it still is fun if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today the film is for you i rate it a on the to scale and a low on the to scale 
imagine this scenario you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long excruciating cross country car trips far from the city and into the deserted rural routes so far the trip is idyllic when abruptly your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere it is not an easy situation but a perfectly plausible one the panorama in which breakdown musters it s throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays but breakdown doesn t bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful titillating climax that by it s finale engrosses a viewer with total absorption the plot is somewhat reminiscent of s the vanishing kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver who later will be an important player in the plot department minutes later after that their brand new strikingly red jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops jeff cannot detect the car s problem so he allows amy to take a ride with red j t walsh a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town where jeff will meet her at a local diner it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo suspenser but instead it opts for maximum fervor jeff manages to re start the car himself but when he arrives at the diner she is nowhere in sight disconcerted the coffee shop s bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife a town about twenty miles from here there trouble arises and i shall not reveal anything else since that would be spoiling the fun of what s head there are many involving tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil and rooting for the good guys in this case jeff kurt russell is one of the few top notch hollywood actors which doesn t overblow his acting and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter perfect suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation from a jolly man to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one not many well paid actors can deliver these type of performances but russell is one of them as an everyday man he pulls it off extremely convincingly what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films minutes although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences very well done yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with faced with an enigma about his wife s whereabouts the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters including the cryptic villains who in essence make the movie what it is what s most impressive however is the feature debut by writer director jonathan mostow mostow hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail biting suspense sought for in a well made affair contrary to most american thrillers he doesn t rely on visual flair but on aesthetics and substance after breakdown he should gain vast notoriety the villains in the movie aren t your routine out of this world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective the baddies in breakdown all well acted are normal seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks and of all things in the world it is becoming rather easy to root for villains jon voight in anaconda in today s movies worth a special mentioning is j t walsh who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision as the leader of the gang he renders a deliciously wicked performance temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for alfred hitchcock used suspense and action not only to stimulate but as a way of aiding his audience s fascination in his stories which were slowly realizing man s biggest fears breakdown yields exactly that it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man acting like an ordinary man looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock i think would approve of breakdown 
sam matthew broderick is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda kelly preston he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton tch ky karyo comes as a complete surprise to him but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton s apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them suddenly anton s ex maggie shows up but she does not want her former lover back on the contrary all she wants to do is vaporize him she may say that she doesn t want to kill him but the possibility doesn t bother her too much either after all people die every day in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times but we haven t griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since while you where sleeping the camera obscura adds a special something to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy everything about the movie is perfect from set design to casting the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite meg ryan known from when harry met sally or sleepless in seattle surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her much more so than in last years courage under fire where she played a gulf war pilot matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality the viewer can tell that he doesn t only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them he has trouble keeping in touch with reality after all who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love his naivet that we don t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge she would do anything to harm anton she doesn t hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier tch ky karyo is perfect as anton he is well repulsive that s all there is to say about him you can t really manage to pity him even after all his mishaps he not only took sam s bride away from him he is also a french chef worlds collide i e the usa and france this can only go wrong even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking you just can t sympathize with a man who plays je t aime moi non plus on his tape deck not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for sam certainly isn t too bad for anton for him things take a turn to the worse addicted to love is one of this year s most pleasant surprises 
swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults steven spielberg may not have directed he only executive produced but his touch certainly is evident in this movie and he knows a money making winner when he sees one the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster big action funny comedy and the pacing of a rollercoaster hopkins plays don diego de la vega otherwise known as zorro a fighter for the people he is eventually captured by don rafael montero stuart wilson who also unintentionally kills his wife the film cuts to twenty years later where vega still wants to montero dead however he s far too old now and trains up thief alejandro murrieta banderas to become the new zorro banderas motive to avenge the death of his brother who was killed at the hands of captain love matthew letscher who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie with the scene set the movie goes on full blast with sword fights a plenty and witty one liners banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro s playing each other off with ease hopkins seems to come off a little better but banderas does some excellent work as the bad guys wilson and letscher seem one dimensional but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way the audience does hate them which can t be bad catherine zeta jones also pops up as hopkins daughter and although she provides little more than the usual female lead she delivers a charming but one note performance the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones there s a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed until jones clothes fall off all together the director fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye handles the film perfectly the action is well done and fast paced the comedy put across well the cast help a lot but the direction is still outstanding although the film is very long the plot keeps chugging along and there s barely a dull moment however the film is a little over indulgent and it could have been trimmed it manages to hold the attention thankfully and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel screenwriters john eskow ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script although they ve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action the plot itself is barely existent there s lots of little sub plots hanging around but there s nothing substantial to bring them all together the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to buy california using gold stolen from the guy he s buying the land off this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines however this doesn t seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film so the film is never quite sure where it s going in the end however zorro provides action and comedy in spades it suitable for everyone so put the guilt behind and put some more money into spielbergs bank account you won t regret it 
men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction action and comedy that hits the target in every possible way although another alien movie men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn t and towers above many other movies of its type the brilliant acting especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay is also as good as it gets director barry sonnenfeld who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty has crafted a masterpiece the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be the men in black or mib are a top secret governmental agency that is not known to exist the mib are responsible for saving the world from the scum of the universe a though job indeed the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens the human kind being transported across the mexico border and into the united states presumably these aliens are all migrant workers that is until the mib show up and begin interrogating them agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien but a real extra terrestrial alien when the alien makes a run for it agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib s very unique weapons and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them the device described as out of state eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on from here we are introduced to james edwards played very well by will smith edwards a police officer is chasing a fleeing criminal the criminal gives a very good chase and at one point when edwards confronts him the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go because someone is after him edwards doesn t take this seriously but when the criminal shows very non human characteristics and leaps off the building he begins to wonder back at the police station agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions he informs edwards that is was in fact a non human that he was chasing and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man made he has edwards identify the gun and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he after goofing up for half of the time edwards puts on a show at the firing range and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib he chased down the criminal on foot which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do in the meantime an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter edgar vincent d onofrio owner of the farm investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport the bug as he is called is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors and it up to the mib with newly recruited agent jay formerly james edwards to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war men in black delightfully combines fast paced action with often hilarious comedy which is usually from will smith although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot as in another big alien film from the past summer screenwriter ed solomon writer of super mario bros and the upcoming x men film has surely struck gold with this story all ages will enjoy men in black it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again although it runs a very quick and speedy minutes the entire film from beginning to end is a non stop adventure the ending of the film which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters is also very well done a sequel is already being planned so there is more to look forward to 
richard gere can be a commanding actor but he s not always in great films everything comes together here gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity it doesn t go exactly as he expects gere s client aaron edward norton is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop the evidence is stacked against him he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishop s blood his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene he has a relationship with the priest gere talks to the boy believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer despite the lawyer s proclamations that he doesn t care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with people s lives he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him lots of complications and twists the prosecuting attorney is gere s former co worker and lover they both work each other s motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on gere s case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas gere is exceptional as the well dressed reserved counselor but just once i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his suit persona even when he loses it you don t see very far inside norton s aaron is convincing he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story as with most of the effective courtroom dramas the cinematography is crisp and rich the story will keep you on the edge of your seat nothing is what it seems 
i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of good will hunting based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film in which the main character will hunting matt damon an mit janitor in his early twenties is discovered to be an einstein level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who s had his share of run ins with the law and before long he s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight professor lambeau stellan skarsgard who had brought up the math problems in his lectures tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police will is to be released provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff but good will hunting rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will s therapist sean mcguire robin williams lambeau wants to get will to use his brain while sean wants him to listen to his heart both of which he has been largely neglecting will finds that the former is much easier than the latter so much so in fact that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar minnie driver an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her what makes good will hunting work so well aside from the strong performances especially from damon and williams is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will s life the script s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong lambeau while he may seem a little cold at times is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we re not sure if we like what he has to say and sean for all his warm heartedness has as lambeau and later will point out not lived up to his full intellectual potential either the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will will s reaction to this situation and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters opinions rather than setting up an obvious right and wrong side and beating them over the head with it for a film with such an extraordinary character good will hunting presents itself as remarkably ordinary it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far fetched situation good will hunting also has its share of fun humor such as when will in an early therapy session pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa will s relationship with his friends most notably chucky ben affleck is usually rather amusing if somewhat crude the film has uses of the f word which was most likely the reason for its r rating and lends itself well to the development of will s character add all this to the fact that good will hunting even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental and you might be wondering why i haven t given this film four stars well for one thing no matter how well damon and affleck who wrote the screenplay and director gus van sant pull it off the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions still good will hunting takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of films 
 the endurance shackleton s legendary antarctic expedition in as the great war descended upon europe sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica this time to be the first to cross the ice bound continent on foot men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years director george butler using film footage and photographs from the historic journey tells their remarkable story in the endurance shackleton s legendary antarctic expedition the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse on foot the vast wasteland of antarctica as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea the entry to the cold cruel continent they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed stranding the men on the flow propelling them away from their goal and eventually into their lifeboats for safety shackleton faced with a desolate situation made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island once on this safe haven shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the mile journey on the world s roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia miraculously the six land after days at sea on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous snow covered mountains covering miles in just hours this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen in the end he is successful and everyone made it back home alive only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war the title of this fascinating documentary the endurance is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived months of the toughest most grueling conditions on the face of the earth the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men with astonishing foresight shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men day to day life the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow after the sinking of the ship the remaining film stock with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world s harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his documentary south an interesting companion piece for the endurance if shackleton s original idea document his trek across the frigid southern continent had been successful it would have been considered a super human feat as you watch the story of the endurance unfold you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent shackleton s amazing mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself there are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work though actor liam neeson narrates the story but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material both film and photo in the documentary s first half as the crew s adventure takes more drastic paths hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks but the treasure of the endurance its film footage is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition i can t think of a true life adventure that shows better the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds the endurance based on caroline alexander s book is an eye opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and even more remarkably all survivors lived to tell about it i give it a b 
usually when a blockbuster comes out it s loaded with effects stars bad scripts and plenty of action mystery men may contain an all star cast and efects but the clever script and characters are what really works which is rare to see this year the film is based upon the comic book series the flaming carrot by bob burden in which wanna be super heroes try and fight crime only to be out done by the real hero of champion city captain amazing greg kinnear things go a little haywire when the sinister casanova frankenstein geoffrey rush is released into the city where he captures captain amazing and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city well the trio decide to take matters in their own hands by saving the city but first they need some assitance this is where the film takes a turn for the better in the beggining there were only wanna be heroes blue raja hank azaria mr furious ben stiller and the shoveller william h macy sure they were enterataining but their acts grew old fast that is until they aquire invisible boy kel mitchell and the bowler janeane garafalo and mr splein paul reubens of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess thankfully the original heroes become amusing with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen the whole premise is rather ridiculous but packs a few punches to keep interest for one the film is considerably clever it literally pokes fun at super hero films like batman and robin superman etc in fact many scenes are similar to batman and robin including the opening sequence only altered in a humorous and superior way a part of the cleverness comes from the cast sometimes a film with such talent is overblown but the acting is what keeps it alive here while azaria and macy were enteratining characters really stood out one was paul reuben no matter how disgusting or revolting mr splein may be you still can t help but laugh it so incredibly moronic it s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions janeane garafalo also was an interesting character she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem due to her enthusiasm that kept the film flowing men is worth seeing alone for those troubled heroes on the downside a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off kel mitchell and geoffrey rush were both utterly useless their parts were so limited they d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than minutes ben stiller too was wasted mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue none of these characters get a rise out of anybody but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film as far as the budget goes it was wisely spent on the cast not the effects while the set designs and action all look nice i m glad there was a seperate aspect that the film focused on and for that i applaud slow at times and rather pointless mystery men still delivers it forgets about money making because it s not likely to make a bundle like it s proceeders and that s what works stupid maybe but for once i m not disappointed no one expected an intelligent film but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year

elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid s it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings internally the catholics wage war against the protestants meanwhile spain scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth cate blanchett will be their greatest hope for survival the film charts elizabeth s tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom as a protestant she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen but her half sister queen mary kathy burke deathly ill and unable to conceive a child pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne mary gives her her blessing on only one condition that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land once declared queen elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault both by her own subjects including the duke of norfolk played with steely eyed grace by christopher eccleston and by forces abroad slowly but surely the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham geoffrey rush in a perfectly subtle performance also on her side is sir william cecil sir richard attenborough her well meaning but misguided chief adviser with few people she can trust elizabeth must prove her self worth any way she can even if it means being the iron fisted ruler she secretly despises blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self consciousness and shrewd charisma though not a classical beauty blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk she is at home with her character s playful tendencies particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley joseph fiennes whether fending off unctuous suitors or playing the houses in court blanchett s elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur s visual delights he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes rolling green hills extravagant ceremonial galas dark and foreboding corridors all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here though writer michael hirst s script gets a little murky at times and his injections of humor get a little overplayed elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing as a whole the story survives because elizabeth s struggle is one which deserves attention by the time she makes her shocking but very sensible final declaration we re ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen 
it s wednesday march and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte south carolina the crime a young prostitute elizabeth renee zellweger has been brutally slain one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority miles away the police duo of braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are strapped for leads at the moment they have only one possible suspect wayland tim roth a wealthy unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act that s the premise for deceiver a new thriller from the pate brothers jonas and josh who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not so bright cops captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland s iq is by contrast kennesaw s is and braxton s is the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered over three days as wayland returns to answer more questions the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until inevitably it boils over other plot elements are thrown in for good measure wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can in stressful situations render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent braxton a compulsive gambler is deep in debt to a local syndicate and kennesaw is haunted by a dark abusive side that delights in terrorizing women especially his wife rosanna arquette whom he suspects of being unfaithful the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth s death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand the suspect or his questioners deceiver which mostly transpires in a dimly lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue has the feel of a david mamet play edgy claustrophobic and tense the atmosphere is explosive and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting deceiver has the power to grab an audience unfortunately in the end it succumbs to the need to throw in one last unexpected twist and this is its undoing for while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers it also stretches our credulity too much and raises more questions than it answers it s only an effective wrap up if you don t think too carefully about its full implications of course the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic police procedure is totally ignored and it s almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction not plot details deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth s final days and hours the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice over by visually showing what really happened moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks the movie obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir drips atmosphere there are some fascinating stylistic touches for example although the setting is contemporary all of the telephones are old fashioned rotary models cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver s look some of the things he tries mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow work exceptionally well while others like any of several lazy susan shots seem more like unnecessary visual tricks as wayland tim roth gives the film s top performance despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he s supposed to be the other two leads chris penn and michael rooker aren t as effective both play their characters like familiar types penn s performance is uninspired rooker s lacks subtlety some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors renee zellweger in a role that s miles away from her star making turn in jerry maguire brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw s wife and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who s entrusted with evaluating wayland s condition one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience plot points aren t hammered home and although the ending has its weaknesses everything isn t spelled out in bold letters the pates give audience members credit for having brains which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers occasionally gripping and never uninteresting deceiver is a fine noir effort 
gothic murder mystery yarns are not a new conceit in fact they ve been around in books and on film for many many years without the proper handling they come off as old fashioned bland and outdated the gift directed by sam raimi is a tried and true effort that surprises very little and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond it s fairly obvious who the killer is in fact i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions the film ultimately shouldn t work but it does thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other annie wilson cate blanchett is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale hilary swank who is severely abused by her husband donnie keanu reeves and buddy cole giovanni ribisi an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father for annie she does not give the readings merely for money but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone s future her late grandmother rosemary harris told her as a child that it was a gift she was given and she should always remember that when annie s eldest son is involved in a fight at school she meets the nice guy school principal wayne collins greg kinnear whom she finds herself attracted to but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king katie holmes whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about at a party with her best friend linda kim dickens annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan gary cole soon after jessica has disappeared leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale and the pond behind his home the gift may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level but the performances and tight direction from raimi who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film s for love of the game lift the picture up several notches slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights the disappearance of jessica at the minute mark divulges the movie s true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut at times frightening horror mystery at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett s the talented mr ripley who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run of the mill protagonist into a very exact down to earth realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing both as a character and an actress blanchett isn t the only bright performer as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year in her first role following her oscar win for s boys don t cry hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie who seeks guidance from annie but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all to leave the grossly abusive donnie as donnie keanu reeves s the watcher makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all for the often criticized reeves whose acting abilities have never been the best this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get and it is also one of the better performances he has given giovanni ribisi s the boiler room is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad in the small but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king katie holmes s wonder boys has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before and she is radiant in her few scenes finally kim dickens s hollow man makes her usual strong impression as annie s spicy best friend linda the other notable aspect of the gift is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it s almost suffocating thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent but one that is filled with dread helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast the gift is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills and offers up a fair share of chills too it may not be groundbreakingly original but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time 
wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon denise richards and neve campbell that deals with all the issues sex love murder and betrayal the setting of the film is a town named blue bay it consists of many swamps and slums and on the other hand rich estates owned by the town s different benefactors the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town s ritzy expensive high school it is here that we meet all of the core characters there s guidance counselor sam lombardo police officers ray duquette and gloria perez dark mysterious senior suzie toller and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor but none more than kelly throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape shortly after suzie too confesses that sam raped her as well this pushes kelly s sex craving mother sandra to stop at nothing until sam is convicted during the trial kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her however it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor after sam is cleared kelly s mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her it is then revealed that sam kelly and suzie were all in on it together it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda matt dillon stars as sam lombardo sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage he isn t the obvious best of actors but dillon does give a convincing performance however his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles although he never had many to start out with in the first place neve campbell who most people relate to scream and scream plays blue bay outcast suzie toller suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film campbell is very successful with this character adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch playing kelly van ryan is denise richards kelly is your typical rich sexy head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses like her sexpot mother sandra one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother denise richards still hot off the press from starship troopers gives the most interesting performance in the entire film in the beginning kelly looks to be a paper thin character but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy but dominating as well kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette this character looks to be one of the most boring predictable in the film however it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story still the film doesn t seem to gain much from bacon s performance only his name in the supporting cast theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan daphne rubin vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez and bill murray shines as sam s lawyer ken bowden hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller the eroticism which is portrayed with good taste is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it s share of twists 
wong kar wei s fallen angels is on a purely visceral level one of the most exciting films i ve seen in a long while unfortunately wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for ordinarily that alone would be enough to sink a movie but in the case of fallen angels this is not so every shot in this film is exciting just to look at wong does really interesting things with the camera but he doesn t allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over as was the case with last years dismal knock off which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe ugh the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives i can t say much more than that as i didn t really know what was going on most of the time in fact it wasn t until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character the constantly moving camera doesn t really allow for the audience to associate with any one character we re always kept at a distance from these people i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters fallen angels is a refreshing change of pace from most hollywood films which never bother to try anything different at least on a visual level in fact i d go so far as to say that fallen angels is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i ve ever seen sure there s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images there were far too many instances during fallen angels in which i asked myself now who are these people again is this that first couple or the second couple it was impossible to keep track perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which by introducing them to us with name cards as in scorsese s mean streets that s really besides the point though wong kar wei has proven himself through very few films that s he s a movie maker to watch let s just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies 
i don t know what movie the critics saw but it wasn t this one the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring in my personal opinion they couldn t be more wrong if you were expecting airplane like laughs and agatha christie intense mystery then yes this movie would be a disappointment however if you re just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time this is one to see honest it is this story is about a th network wbn taking to america s airwaves in penny henderson mary stuart masterson the station owner s secretary must deal with her overbearing boss an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment s notice partly due to the fact that they haven t been paid in weeks among the mayhem she must also deal with her soon to be ex husband roger brian benben who desperately wants her back unfortunately her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation while trying to woo penny back roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny i m trying to be unbiased so i won t tell you how amazing she looked although brian benben gets most of the screen time along with the two leads are several recognizable faces including corbin bernsen l a law michael mckean laverne shirley and bobcat goldthwait the special effects are amazing and fooled me which some may argue isn t very difficult to do in many scenes although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie overall i gave it or an depending on what system you use some comments collected from friends 
mary norton s children s book series the borrowers has been made into several below average television movies so i wasn t too enthused as i entered the theater for the big screen debut of the minute clan but i was in for a shock the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home their aunt who owned the property never left a will now an unscrupulous lawyer ocious potter john goodman plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra modern housing development but the lenders are not alone in their house living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human beans above the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders so it is up to the clocks pod jim broadbent and homily celia imrie along with their kids arrietty flora newbigin and peagreen tom felton to recover the will and save the household but when potter learns of the tiny people he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff mark williams to kill off the clan there s plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers especially in the furnishings of the clock family house made out of lost board game parts and credit cards the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling based on an original story the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a inch tall person as the villain john goodman s performance veers on the edge of being over the top but his performance suits the role well and he does very well in the film s many slapstick moments with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets bluescreen shots and cgi the special effects in the borrowers are very well done there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children only movie for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch 
 a bug s life may not be toy story but it s more close than antz was i really liked antz basically because yes it is clever and witty and intelligent and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead perhaps the year s most inspired casting but there was in fact something missing from it and i m the first to admit that maybe it s that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun it s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging and if it weren t for woody allen it would have been just a really clever good not great flick a bug s life has a similar premise and it also has disney to insure that it s g rated and not totally over kids heads like antz was not a bad thing believe me but what it also has is a tone that s completely innocent even when it s also remaining perpetually clever antz is still the more witty film and i love it for it and a bug s life is more for general consumption but it s also more entertaining it broadens its horizons and when it really moves from the ant colony it really shows us a whole new world we ve never seen before and it s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in antz it s also light and clever the visuals are instead of earth tones bright worldly colors and still gives the amazing visual technology of antz at least a worthy contender the characters are also nicely realized though watered down for broad consumption they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films the lead character flik voiced by dave foley is nothing more than a slightly less neurotic z from antz but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z instead of gene hackman playing the villain we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper the nicely titled hopper and for the romantic lead we don t get spacey sharon stone but intelligent and hard to get julia louis dreyfuss who doesn t even come around until the very final frames not that the plot s really any better than the one in antz it s basically yet another redux of the seven samurai with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else when flik a bone fide inventor creates a time conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season s donation he puts them all in risk and is sent away so that he won t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers he runs into a group of warrirors who are unbeknownst to him a group of carnival bugs and they agree to help under similar false pretenses these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in toy story foppish walking stick slim david hyde pierce german caterpillar heimlich joe ranft quick tempered and insecure male ladybug francis denis leary pretentious praying mantis manny jonathan harris his assistant butterfly hypsy madeliene kahn spider rosie bonnie hunt and two fleas tuck and roll michael mcshane who speak in undiscernable jibberish the writers lightly touch on each bug s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat whose usual mild mannered squeal is a scream of death the bug city is a modern day metropolis complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb holding out a cup with a sign lying next to him that says kid tore off wings and a rainstorm is like a giant flood with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour around this the pixar animators stage several large set pieces like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket meanwhile each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting something antz couldn t do and by the end over the end credits a bug s life pulls it s final punch out clever ing antz with a series of incessantly hilarious faux bloopers that come just at the right time when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money s worth of entertainment still it s no toy story that film maybe above any animated film i ve ever seen encompassed almost true perfection in story character and wit it proved that it didn t need to brag about it s cutting edge technology to really soar it s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far but is still the most satisfying and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun yet a bug s life as well as antz are still amazing films and prove without doubt that if you re gonna make a computer animated film send it to the guys who created these three flicks evne if they re not working under the same roof 
i must admit i m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre but something drew me to this film maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role and the hilarious eugene levy maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity con air and pushing tin but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life the story of serendipity is simple two people john trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale looking ever so hot have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves with buck henry smack dab in the middle charmed beyond repair these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf called serendipity talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink but with each of them already involved with other parties sara has john write his name and number on a bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera sara declares that if this thing let s just call it love is destined to happen fate will bring them together in the future years later and on opposite coasts of america john and sara both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat and mouse game with the fates involving such items as mistaken identity a graduate homage john corbett as a freaky new age musician and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman to find out if that thing was right after all fortunately first time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong well rounded characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones and the use of time lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters on the flipside films such as you ve got mail made in heaven and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film s main journey at hand but it s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture 
not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets lies like bergman director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations also like bergman leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ravished and wracked faces and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film all that is missing is a discussion of god which is not to say that secrets lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master in fact it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind nonetheless what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place that it takes some effort to adjust to the film s rhythms once the adjustment is made however there are great rewards one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is though leigh may have adopted some of bergman s stylistic touches most obviously in an early scene of terse cross cutting during a married couple s strained conversation as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any style at all whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality leigh makes the camera a mere observer almost as in a pbs documentary the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors it is a tribute to everyone involved that despite such scrutiny only infrequently are we aware that anyone is acting much has been made of brenda blethyn s performance and rightly so but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is there are a few missteps for one except for one scene tragicomic as it happens there is scant humor in the film this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout and occasionally as with bergman the bluntness of the situations can seem forced for all that this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film in fact it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film s unspoken take on race relations something an american audience at least would do well to observe nonetheless secrets lies is not for the faint of heart though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen needless to say it is also very depressing at times but for many of us of course so is life and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better 
frequency n the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable etc don t worry when watching the thriller frequency you won t have to know what the heck frequency means the premise although it may sound complex is very basic on the big screen a new york cop john jim caviezel finds a radio in his house which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father frank dennis quaid who died thirty years ago immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn t supposed to the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john s mother and nine other women it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place i told you that wasn t confusing overall i was very pleased with frequency it s occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes i usually don t buy those cheesy i love you dad segments in movies but this one surprisingly satisfied me maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative frequency s creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended what if what would i do would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated or stop some kids from shooting other kids or buy stock from yahoo a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future both share that change the past slightly and you ll change the future heavily warning the changes between the present and the past such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs are very similar both are also wonderful feel good family films that can attract to a number of generations the only difference worth noting is that frequency s final scene doesn t set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making there are some problems with the film though first there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently no pun intended switch from to while telling the story another problem is that the supporting cast including noah emmerich and andre braugher are underused while in the film which is not enough the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you like it almost did for me check this movie out you may be surprised as well 
every once in a while a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise i don t necessarily mean in terms of quality rather i m referring to the mere knowledge of its existence usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo it has slipped rather quietly into limited release and appears destined to slip out just as quietly that s a shame because princess caraboo is a delightful fable romantic gentle and very appealing what s more it s surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp witted lesson in english social history princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early th century england involving a young woman phoebe cates who is found wandering the countryside apparently unable to speak any english she is taken in by good hearted gentlewoman mrs worrall wendy hughes her banker husband jim broadbent is none too pleased about this strange houseguest until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island the princess caraboo this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr worrall and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs worrall however local journalist john gutch stephen rea is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo as a social satire and comedy of manners princess caraboo is a winner it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr worrall a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude he is worse than one of the idle rich he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them and since the house and money are all from mrs worrall he is a bit too close to them for comfort while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule director and co writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light hearted to be heavy handed he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes as the princess becomes a sensation at court in one of the film s best sequences princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in sensations an idea that takes on a timeless quality and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show social commentary aside princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment the performers are mostly delightful particularly phoebe cates who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime her supporting players are also appealing wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs worrall kevin kline as frixos the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler stephen rea as the world weary but ultimately romantic gutch only john lithgow is a disappointment turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess s identity the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt without becoming gimmicky it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn t given more time to develop because the potential seemed to be there when it finally does blossom it seems too quick to be plausible princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp still it has both escapist and intellectual appeal and is well worth seeking out it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding a hidden gem 
what if one of our cities became the target for terror what can we do what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster so far america has been the leading nation opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world it is the land of opportunities it is the land of freedom but what if it became the new target this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality when a special branch of the united states military under the command of general william devereaux bruce willis takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice the only warning the fbi receives is a single cryptic message release him then all hell breaks loose in new york a bus is destroyed killing civilians a broadway theater is bombed hostages are taken at a school as the wave of terrorist activity crests the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law devereaux argues against that eventuality but is nevertheless ready to lead men into action on american soil another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard denzel washington the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities his staff is comprised of smart energetic intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o f moronic feds we re used to seeing in movies hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft annette bening whose department knows more about the situation than they re willing to reveal but the attacks escalate the fbi are helpless chasing an invisible enemy the land is under siege they have lost control a terror is coming from within what s great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life it reflects reality and that s why it makes such an impact edward zwick has created a clever well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously and so his film plays on several levels never loosing focus on its main objective he is exploring the abuse of power the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u s government the army the fbi and the cia he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved the palestinian community in new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii there are concentration camps and unlawful interments all in the name of the greater good in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul freedom was that what the terror ists really wanted this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab american population in the u s and n y especially but to me these protests seem unnecessary zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys the script is therefore wonderfully balanced agent hubbard s best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad tony shalhoub is lebanese american and it is quite often you hear lines such as my first boyfriend was palestinian they seduce you with their suffering or they love this country as much as we do but no matter how you twist this matter you won t get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab speaking population who are in the great majority more to the point the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab americans by the u s military and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any way denzel washington is dashing as always in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage a network of snitches and seduction to gather information bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist hungry for power that never looses his connection with the audience since his point of view is not too hard to understand the film is elegantly shaped the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism he tightens the intensity as the events progress and when a plot twist comes it actually is surprising it is not a film drained in patriotism like the work of roland emerich nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey it has courage enough to get involved in politics it questions our foreign policies mentality and defense i must admit that it ends rather disappointing as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down but despite of that it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts a virtue that few summer films can boast of this is the u s army it s a broadsword not a scalpel believe me you do not want us in an american city gen william devereaux the siege 
this british import follows the mis adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths there is marc renton who narrates spud the dim witted one sick boy the sean connery obsessive and begbee the violence obsessive powered by a top rate but not top name soundtrack iggy pop sleeper elastica lou reed the film follows renton who gets clean gets back into heroin and gets clean again some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction esque and some is just dumb dumber gross the bed sheets and stupid the bb gun although the film starts out on a comic note it takes a sharp term in the middle and becomes almost depressing the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it is an obscure gem that has been over shadowed in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors this is a very original film as far as films go today it definetly deserves multiple viewings partly because of the slang and accents jeremy dennison mr orange centuryinter net 
i rented this movie with very high hopes this movie got praise as one of the best films of and unfortunately was not as good as i hoped but was still very intriguing and thought provoking first of all the casting for this film is great tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly with a plot as unbelievable as this film you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast tobey and reese bud and mary sue parker play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability william h macy an actor i have grown to love over the past year turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife a colored person and his friends the non colored ones he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood joan allen is equally great as betty parker the ideal tv mom her character is the most ambitious she is very na ve and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that her lack of chemistry with macy which the role calls for and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast then this film would even been even better as said before jeff daniels gives a bad performance his character displays the change going on throughout the town yet he does not display it with enough conviction his character is very confusing and he is not very believable this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance the movie is very provocative it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch but do it in a slow pace the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length some films are not meant to be that long pleasantville is one of those films this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it first they are amazed by the implementation of color then they want to have it then they do not want to then the war ensues between the colored and non colored this is all strung out over two hours which was way too long some movies need a lot of time saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time this film is only two hours long and seems much longer length is everything in films if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace you can win half the battle pleasantville can move at a good pace at times but it is not consistent enough overall pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days i went in expecting a light hearted film about change i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change luckily pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time 
capsule the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi day festivities mira nair s film is pleasant enough with a little human drama a few family secrets some sadness and some happiness you have seen it all before but perhaps not from india the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable low to mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala her newest film written by sabrina dhawan is very similar to previous films like betsy s wedding but it is set in new delhi a wealthy family is having a wedding an indian wedding is a multi day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial even more than in the us it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get together the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members individual story lines aditi verma is marrying hemant an indian engineer working in the us she had previously had a relationship with vikram her supervisor latit her father played by naseeruddin shah is juggling many problems not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice one of the family servants several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex family secrets or both there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna on the other hand it was not clear to me at least if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english the latter will however help with an international release sabrina dhawan s screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog we have seen films with plotting very much like this but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life i rate it a on the to scale and a low on the to scale 
krippendorf s tribe is a formula comedy done poorly formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema however every now and then one emerges like krippendorf s tribe that actually works professor james krippendorf richard dreyfuss the renowned anthropologist is in trouble his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea however he found nothing his wife has recently died and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael lidner tonight he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe rather than break the news and face the consequences of misusing his funds he invents a tribe the shelmikedmu named after his kids however one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu but his research becomes a popular phenomenon soon professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over eager colleague veronica micelli jenna elfman and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist ruth allen lily tomlin krippendorf s tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes luckily as the film builds momentum that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by though there s some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable and the comic timing required for some of the film s latter scenes is superb richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe jenna elfman s position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times but she plays the part with extreme affability even the kids who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side are endearing and humorous yes the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor but it has the best excuse of all it s funny it may not go down as an all time classic but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy plenty of laughs 
i don t box with kid gloves i don t play nice i m not a nice guy and i never ever go easy on a film i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic however i do some favors and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery rigormortis the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking gets several of these points each time i still however will not go easy on them they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy which begins quite wittily with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it in the famous lines of many martyrs i have no regrets well i do have some regrets but that is not the point in the previous sentence the point of it was that down with america was a film that from a critical standpoint did not entirely disappoint me sure the risky use of vhs instead of super mm or mm was a pain and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable down with america concerns a government agent needless murder and a book containing everything from the unabomber s manifesto to the apple computer profit report like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed it displays an off kilter humor and intelligence it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the s a dying movement from the day they started these paranoid thrillers had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word roswell in down with america the line roswell is highly absent with an about ten minute running time down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich that the conspiracy films fell into makes jokes at them at the same time and provides us with funny and memorable characters again i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn t care less about the film as previously stated concerns a federal agent peter roach an obsessed librarian meri stevens a mystery man joe kaczkowski and two people obsessed with silence in the library robb sherman kevin flowers the plot a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in a public library where it can be viewed by all from there we go into a delightful parody the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to no name it ends up being the no name people who do a good job delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out for once i don t have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l auto and les x files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself it s almost as much fun as the film 
there was a lot riding on this movie everyone even moderately interested in the scream series was dying to know how it would end what would be the final act this is the end of an era for them a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies and for kids under those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into scream while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves no need to worry scream is endlessly inventive and entertaining a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name reinvented the horror genre and continued in the self referential post modern tradition of quentin and co so how does the story go as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe sidney prescott neve campbell now all grown up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress but rather in upstate california living understandably alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone but that s not where the movie starts off instead in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar and conceptually horrifying sequence in eye for an eye cotton weary liev schreiber now a big star drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls demands the location of sidney s home and when he doesn t get it threatens the life of cotton s girlfriend christine and cotton can t do anything to stop him the rest of the sequence is particularly clever setting up a constant throughout the picture the killer has a high tech electronic voice changer that tops that of the first two not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice over artist roger jackson ha ha he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters including sidney and the returned gale weathers courtney cox arquette and dewey riley david arquette at the same time stab the third film within a film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro whereas the account of the first two films was true the franchise within scream has now become totally fictional nevertheless we learn cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production as himself to be killed off in the first scene so it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie either the actor portraying them or the real thing sometimes both clever indeed but who goes next no one knows three different scripts were penned we re told to keep the true finale off the internet a nod to the scream fiasco a few years back and no one knows for sure which one the killer read still all the while sidney stays concealed in her home only visiting dad for the first half hour of the film while also having horrifying visions of her mother which takes us back a bit to sidney s fear of becoming what her mother was or at least what her mother was secretly when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent she s chased onto the set of stab wandering through woodsboro written and directed as an odd surreal nightmare indeed this is one of scream s finest moments okay over the years i ll admit that i ve become quite the scream fan no i don t have the ghostface costume or the director s cut laserdisc but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films yes i said dramatic element sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with scream throughout the film though i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films granted that there s stabbin a plenty going on throughout but there s considerably less blood less gore honestly i like this approach it s more classical more rebellious constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience some critics have noted that scream seems to take itself more seriously this time maybe so or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger arlington road who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts saw an opportunity for true irony maybe even a little bit of satire if the film worked in a few more clich s what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film i m afraid is the ending or rather the identity of the killer it does the job i guess accomplishes what it should bringing the three films full circle but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived too arbitrary after a second viewing which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation the killer s identity still seems a little too random but his motivation came across more sound this time around and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying all in all scream does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy it is not the worst of the films as a trilogy scream was a lot of fun refreshing humorous offbeat almost sad to see it go but then it does seem best to quit while you re ahead and scream does a fine job of providing closure to its characters for now scream holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid not too shabby 
director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films you need look no further than die hard he was director of photography speed and last years twister for examples of his hi octane edge of your seat thrill prowess speed is no exception this time the action takes place on a huge cruise liner on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship yep that s right no keanu reeves this time but fear not jason patrick is more than up to the job speaking of which the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist willem dafoe from crashing the liner into a huge island after stealing a diamond collection the reason for this act of destruction is revenge after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers he contracts copper poisoning and is retired naturally what entails next is a lot of running jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day thinking back on this film you can t help but admire it s structure the way willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers the race against time to save the liner from crashing and of course the finale chase scence although this is ruined by an over the top one too many stunt and explosion simple in construction effective in it s execution and the result a clear and concise highly enjoyable action film the acting is adequate although it s darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a hot totty appeal to the men and she does that perfectly jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist overall speed is a most enjoyable thrill ride not up to it s predecessor s high calibre but very good all the same there is plenty going on some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie 
the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be in some ways in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint and its series sequel the return of the saint val kilmer plays simon templar an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others this movie closely resembles a james bond flick it has the classic bond symbols a man who can do just about anything and get away with it a woman whom the man persues a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests as a young boy kilmer s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name that of a catholic saint he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be this leads to a devestating mistake which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life kilmer s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak played by rade serbedzija during a press conference he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area avoiding guards cameras and many other potential obstacles once his mission is completed and he is safely home the fee is paid when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of million he decides to carry out only one more mission then retire dr emma russell portrayed by elisabeth shue has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia where millions are without heat and are freezing to death the only problem is tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal tretiak hires him to steal the equations small pieces of paper from shue one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions they are very convincing not only to the characters in the movie but to us kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue s character into getting to know him even more which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula when the two meet and end up having a sensual experience kilmer s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell as she is falling in love with kilmer s alter ego a traveling artist yet he must reach his goal of million which requires him to steal the energy formula putting his feelings aside shue s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces the names of the catholic saints together something no one else is able to do when she finds him they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak the saint is very action packed with few slow points the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments along the course of the movie there are even a few although brief moments of comedy these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer s extraneous very convincing disguises and personalities all in all a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non stop action 
only a year after the initial release of scream the horror send up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre the inevitable sequel scream has arrived in our theaters while the tongue in cheek parodic element is still noticeable in this film it s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story the first film while often violent and gruesome was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant the premise of scream is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called stab based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers courtney cox about the events in scream is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy its conclusion in which a bleeding wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it s a publicity stunt is more surreal and disturbing than anything else the satire in scream thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general although resident horror film geek randy jamie kennedy is back with fresh dialogue about sequels and interestingly enough how they are usually inferior to their predecessors the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well everything from friends and saved by the bell to showgirls and terminator is referenced here horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning and there aren t any wes carpenter jokes this time more importantly this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from scream in fact the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety and one man seems willing to save the heroine s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show understandably scream does not go so far as to actually blame the movies but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted couple that with the fact that several of the characters most notably the lead character sidney prescott neve campbell are fairly well developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine chilling suspense and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right we don t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered and in one case a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner while i have not seen any of his other work it s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated slasher film director as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing unfortunately scream occasionally reverts to the time honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window for example several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that s he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction as for the question of whether or not scream is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor well it s hard to say i gave the first scream stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light hearted send up scream bounces all over the place stylistically but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment i m not sure which is the better movie but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing sequels however much randy might argue do not necessarily suck 
roman emperor marcus aurelius richard harris chooses his trusted general maximus russell crowe as his successor however the emperor s evil son commodus joaquin phoenix murders his father before the announcement can be made and maximus as well as his family is sentenced to be executed maximus is able to escape his executioners but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo oliver reed proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money he being a former gladiator himself and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence style of moviemaking the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used it s choppy slow motion which is unsettling and distracting it s similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan but nowhere near as effective the actual gladiator battles are thrilling but also a bit disjointed many times it s unclear as to exactly what s going on all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled we re not sure who s blood or by who s hand though there s an instance of this earlier in the film too that s disappointing it s comes when maximus escapes his executioners some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free but i still don t know exactly how he did it russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in s virtuosity for whatever reason his stardom never arrived but he should have it now from here on moviegoers should now be able to say let s go see the new russell crowe movie he gets the best scene in the film and one of the best moments of all recent movies when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum it s both rousing and chilling joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character which could have easily happened commodus is conniving sneaky and whiny but phoenix never lets the character get silly it s a very good and very creepy performance oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator and it s a huge loss to the acting world i ve always been fascinated with reed he s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years it s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again as he gives a fun and sincere performance the film is dedicated to him and he will surely be missed reed s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem as he still had scenes to be completed rather than recast the role and end up reshooting a great deal of footage a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of million dollars ironically that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film anyway this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of for about twenty seconds and if you aren t looking for it you won t even be able to tell some of the other digital effects are less convincing however and like i always say noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately it s sad that such a good film has these distractions movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events but is entirely a work of fiction however it s a work of fiction that s great entertainment and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in a d 
the rich man s wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double where the story and characters are so one dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn t be enjoying yourself but somehow the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things not that it s bad it s just that it s been done before and better in my opinion i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre but it s probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet striving helplessly to get out and instead of just flushing him you end up kind of rooting for the little guy that s basically how i felt about this movie i mean it s not very good but it s not completely bad either the wife of the title is josie potenza played nicely by halle berry she is married to tony christopher mcdonald you know the guy who looks like joe piscapo a really stressed out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn t give josie the attention she deserves cough cough thus she is driven into the arms of another man jake golden clive owen near the beginning of the film josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods once there however tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details i m still not quite sure what line of work he s in making the best of her situation josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars one night she meets a stranger named cole peter greene finally getting a meaty role they have dinner together and eventually both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal after learning that she is not happily married cole offers to take care of the problem managing to escape from the psychotic maniac josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband but then one night cole shows up and here is where the fun begins from this point on it s going to be a no holds barred cliche fest ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out and for the most part they re right the rich man s wife has nary one original bone in it s body but who cares if you re looking for good ol dumb suspense movie you can t do much better than this and if you suspense buffs aren t already sold it has a killer of an ending too 
upon taking a seat at the theater and surveying the crowd i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises i m twenty two but have been accused of looking sixteen yet as the film began any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close knit yet troubled sisters director pat o connor inventing the abbots circle of friends weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss need and the bonds between five sisters the family is ruled by kate meryl streep an unconsciously strict schoolteacher who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family there is very little background given to the viewer as we are thrust into a tense but loving home squabbles take place one after the other caused by years and years of history perhaps one of the best things about this film is its naturalness no situation is over wrought and characters react as real people do to real problems this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples both in lughnasa and africa in fact dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness legs tap and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster only after the music stops and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble in the quiet after the music we muse that it s sad that music has to cease and families falter the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy the narrator of the movie as a young child flying a kite he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string and the kite floats off farther into the distance drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained and at another glance mischievous the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite and kate s hold of the family isn t strong enough to hold off the winds of change as michael stands staring at his kite fly away we hear the adult michael looking back at the season that his world changed forever the movie is not overpowering but it gives us a beautiful window into the life love and trouble of a household of lonely women note this is the first movie review i ve ever written any responses on it would be greatly appreciated 
ingredients pouring rain small flooded town damn about to burst bad guys going after millions of dollars synopsis at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church he replies something like the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire well the fire wasn t that bad since while the church was burning looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding everyone has had to evacuate because it s raining and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break enter a working class smart alecky new armored car driver named tom christian slater suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money hide it and swim for his life this makes for an action movie full of jet skis speedboat chases and gun battles as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen minnie driver but unknown to tom and karen the national guard never heard tom s initial distress call will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters opinion don t expect thought provoking issues or dramatics there s not much more to this movie than hiding running swimming shooting and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning but that s what makes it escapist and fun relax take your shoes off and break out the popcorn 
the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do lives are often at stake and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment s notice the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor psychologist and sham artist in addition to being a police officer he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower most of all the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible and quickly gain control of the situation dominate the conversation and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants it takes a pretty smart person to do that but what if the hostage holding criminal is just as smart what if he s also able to think on his feet in fact what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f gary gray s the negotiator in this film police negotiator danny roman samuel l jackson is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman s home roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder faced with the scorn of most of the police department and under close scrutiny by the media roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain s office i don t quite remember if the captain actually said i hate to do this but although it wouldn t surprise me if he did luckily the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above after being offered a take it or leave it deal by the district attorney roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum j t walsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming he has been framed although roman s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue jackson while a superb actor is miscast in the role of roman the actor has become so popular and so often identified as a protagonist notable exceptions can be found such as in jackie brown that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence how can we believe he s going to shoot a hostage no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier unfortunately this preconception saps the film of some of it s would be suspenseful moments and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson s acting ability almost every time he s in a scene jackson steals it without looking back when spacey appears the film has already run about a third of its course his is an interesting character made out to be some kind of negotiating superman our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower but i can t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he says when he gets the call to action however he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be soon his character has to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in a team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiations fail this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor as the second protagonist spacey measures up nicely gray really lucked out with this cast david morse as commander beck ron rifkin as commander frost and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices morse played a similar role in the rock rifkin played the d a in l a confidential and spencer played a police detective in cop land with the level of acting however this can be forgiven also in the supporting cast paul giamatti as rudy one of the hostages is notable for the comic relief he provides his character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just looks so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even says anything fortunately this doesn t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout j t walsh as the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks in with one of his final performances sadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon for one of his best performances check out sling blade in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success the actors performed together in a few good men the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing in the end the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it s reality we re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best as an audience we re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie and we d like to see if one will dominate the film both provide some pretty good entertainment 
quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers after his pulp fiction many actors began receiving many offers for jobs john travolta made his come back and is now one of today s most bankable stars bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor jackie brown on the other hand boasts quite a well known cast except for the main lead pam grier most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films but she s never really had a breakthrough performance her first film was in the roger ebert written beyond the valley of the dolls that is until now jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction after mediocre acting jobs tarantino returns to what made his name a household one directing and writing jackie brown is the result and it is fantastic entertainment despite excellent direction from tarantino the cast steals the film giving one good performance after another pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent samuel l jackson bridget fonda michael keaton robert de niro and robert forster more than likely you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult as you really can t say much or you spoil it for everyone else i will tread lightly jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown grier in a blue outfit walking through the airport the camera tracks along with her and ends up revealing her occupation we are also introduced to ordell robbie jackson who sells illegal guns to interested buyers for a hefty price ms brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away however an fbi agent keaton and a local l a cop michael bowen are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money they try to reach him through beaumont livingston chris tucker one of ordell s buyers but he mysteriously ends up dead they try again through brown but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong doing but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell s friends fonda she is caught and sent to jail ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent max cherry forster and then wants to find out what she told the cops after she claims to have said nothing she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison ordell doesn t like this but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track this scheme seems to be going as planned but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown and that s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments and slang terms but they are always done very well and believably his hitmen are normally cruel but pleasant in that nasty sort of way they talk like normal people except for when doing business and they are rude to their girlfriends of course this is a tarantino film and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop of course tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film adding a lot of his reservoir dogs style storytelling to it things are told from one person s perspective and then from another and then from another each time learning more and more this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion which decides who is on whose side on the technical side of jackie brown quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his film however this time around it isn t as nearly as impressive or original the writing on the other hand is quite good although i do find tarantino s use of slang terms offensive the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction but it s much more easy to understand his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation but jackie brown is very simply to follow especially considering that the time is given during the leaps in time perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel rum punch by elmore leonard the dialogue is pretty much intelligent and all the characters are fully realized the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro who has worked with tarantino on previous films and the editing is very good and as with pulp fiction the music is a highlight bringing back memorable songs from the s and s the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable the performances are incredibly rich with hidden meaning behind every characters actions nothing is quite as it seems and you can t really tell which side one person is on the real treat of course is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits which play an important role in the film watching grieg i could tell what was going through her mind even if i didn t know what she was thinking her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad happy or in deep thought bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato i didn t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits her performance actually reminded me of heather graham s in boogie nights michael keaton comes across very well as does michael bowen chris tucker has a small but effective performance samuel l jackson is very good but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction although much less cynical but no matter jackson is very strong in his role robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times but overall he does a good job as one of ordell s perspective clients and friends robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film as he has one of the most developed characters he is present throughout most of the film and he holds his own against jackson and grier jackie brown is rated r for language sex violence drug use and some offensive remarks as a film by itself jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment with a complex plot to draw viewers in however one can not help but compare it to tarantino s pulp fiction and expect great results when compared it comes up short but not that short it s a worthy effort with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress i can t remember seeing her in anything except for a small role in mars attacks but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations and hopefully she will even be able to nab one 
as i walked out of crouching tiger hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a great piece of work and viceversa attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology as the word implies a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality crouching tiger hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category crouching tiger hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore with the requisite blend of legend fantasy magic and mythology it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half gods greater than life purer than life stronger than life physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil which must choose between the two it is the gifted pupil who under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters are poignantly represented the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours de force not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art as are the prodigious leaps and flights to from and between rooftops the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line which takes place at an ordinary human level yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy do not assume however that the art is limp wristed for those who are put off by the art label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure action and romance there are no weak performances in this movie michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth humanity and wisdom chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart zhang ziyi is a budding superstar she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably kudos to screenwriters james schamus wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing choreographer yuen wo ping photography director peter pau and music director tan dun each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film ang lee as the director co producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes including those who hate martial arts movies don t miss it 
jamaica is a hot vacation spot the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth approximately jamaican dollars to one american the sea is a brilliant blue the air is warm but lacks humidity and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica s biggest trade foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid it guides the audience along a tourist s journey and the story of the native inhabitants instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen it quips you don t see what happens after you flush the toilet this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there this strong sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals this isn t just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation from field to factory as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not of course as can be expected the united states is slammed owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica s economy will help the country back on its feet but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u s is forcing on the citizens admittedly some of the back and forth between the business minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument but jamaica isn t against the united states and this documentary does not accuse the u s of being the sole perpetrator of its grief if anything it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations 
in some respects rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element the duo must always be completely mismatched the hero has to say some smart assed comment before and after shooting someone however that doesn t necessarily make for a bad film rush hour is jackie chan s first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ie hong kong jackie chan is given much more free reign than before still some die hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes which he views as too short according to one interview this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west jackie chan is lee the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case while chris tucker is carter the loudmouthed destructive cop that is promoted to the fbi to help him or at least so he thinks also another classic notion in action films the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes despite the necessary conventions of action films rush hour is some of the most fun you ll spend and hour and forty minutes watching jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches chris tucker familiar from his whiny annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable complementing jackie chan s straight laced character however jackie chan still maintains his comic slapstick edge as expected of him and his films perfectly downplaying the fish out of water routine through his character s attempts at mixing into american culture he makes up for the down time his character experiences when he is in action however you ll be amused and dazzled still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up in this case a steering wheel a serving tray and a barstool jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu chris tucker s character may come across as irritating yet is also humorous since he s not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan he uses his main weapon his mouth hence the tagline fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare it is appropriate for the film and still very funny while not necessarily poignant attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well lee s knowledge of american pop culture that s the beach boys when contrasted against carter s lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick while carter teaches lee hip hop dance moves while rush hour is not at the same level as police story and known in north america as supercop and jackie chan s first strike respectively it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr nice guy with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs it makes for a fun film as well it is a true departure from jackie chan films as it is missing one common element a whiny female co star 
denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances this perhaps may be washington s very best to date he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent this season to become his character copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting the hurricane a much better film than it actually is when his rubin hurricane carter feels pain and is tormented by racism he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy disgust and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone as his tortured carter sum up the troubles of racism in america s history he is that amazing the problem with the hurricane is that when compared to washington all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles mainly because the script focuses so much on carter that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors this is without a doubt washington s movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance as rubin carter we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit then after a successful marriage and boxing career he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder carter s second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous powerful white men who refused to let him succeed from these past experiences in jail carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america after several court appeals an autobiography and many public marches for his freedom carter remained locked in prison it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter s book in the s that a serious battle for freedom took place the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career the devastation in washington s eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it in the hole carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot his anger is heightened to a point of no control we see multiple carters a violent angry one a silent passive one and a mediator we see an emotional boxing match inside carter s head from this point in the hole to the end of the film this fight continues it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison the angry carter at first erupts white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life this reminder leads to anger in his head however as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him he realizes that society is changing that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here if only the other actors had this same determination dan hedaya ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around it felt like his character was taken straight out of a scooby doo episode he would have gotten away with it if it wasn t for those annoying little kids the kids in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable the lawyers who help release carter also are underused as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard the complete opposite of his character in shawshank redemption there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears hedaya was superb in clueless same for david paymer in get shorty harris yulin in ghostbusters and liev schreiber in the daytrippers it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles on the other hand it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin hurricane carter this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get 
an unhappy italian housewife a lonely waiter a goofy masseuse lots of love and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips which proves charming despite its covering of predictable well worn material the story concerns the aforementioned housewife rosalba barletta licia maglietta who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation instead of waiting for a ride home rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town but to instead hitchhike to venice upon arriving she tells her self centered husband mimmo an excellent antonio catania that she ll be home in a few days of course that doesn t happen as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries in what seems like days she moves in with lonely suicidal waiter fernando bruno ganz gets a job as a florist learns the accordion and befriends her neighbor a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia marina massironi rosalba who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando i can think of at least five other american movies including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman that are more than similar to bread and tulips but maglietta and ganz who act with restraint and care help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world throughout the movie maglietta has an easygoing confident demeanor which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz s character the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up director and co writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor the cheap mimmo desperate to find his wife after all he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won t do it hires a job applicant giuseppe battiston at his bathroom supply firm to do the job the reason mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories the novice detective s various misfortunes including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother are very funny unfortunately there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips cheery tone rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice which bring the movie to a halt it s like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie several details in fernando s life also never get proper closure including his suicidal tendencies early in the movie he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door after that fernando s step towards death is never made reference to probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm underdeveloped subplot about fernando s stormy past it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn t need any but there aren t a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips the movie is fun and romantic with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we d like to live if we had the nerve or if our passports weren t missing 
have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally at any given moment in life or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world or outside of it these thought provoking questions are the subject of final destination which is the most riveting horror drama since s the sixth sense stylishly filmed and tautly directed by x files alum james wong the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters in accurately written teen speak rather than overwrought highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn t use all the while developing into a darkly foreboding severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less successful but still suspenseful epilogue at the start of the film year old high school senior alex browning devon sawa is about to leave with his student french class for a field trip to paris progressively getting a case of preflight jitters he spots several mysterious coincidences including the departure time being the same as his september birthday as well as hearing the john denver song rocky mountain high over the sound system in the airport bathroom john denver died in a plane crash alex grudgingly mutters to himself once seated alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff and after causing a ruckus onboard he as well as six other students and a teacher are thrown off arguing in the airport lobby alex s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight killing all passengers including the rest of their classmates as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode the fellow survivors whom he has saved treat him in varying manners carter kerr smith the hotshot jock holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate alex s best friend tod chad e donella wants to stand by him but can t because of his fearful parents the teacher mrs lewton kristen cloke is frightened by him believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker only outsider clear rivers ali larter who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life that is only the setup of final destination and the less said about what follows the better suffice to say the film does indeed turn into a slasher film albeit one that is more thoughtful than most and replaces a knife wielding maniac for the never seen granddaddy killer of them all the grim reaper itself the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes and final destination surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner they manage to occasionally be so intense you don t know whether to shrink down in your seat tap your feet in nervousness or turn away devon sawa a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in s underseen slasher comedy idle hands is even more of a charismatic presence here the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival which he comes to believe he wasn t meant to do as well as the loss of the other passengers is superbly and subtly acted on his part one scene in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful ali larter s varsity blues in the other central role is also effective as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man the exact opposite of her now deceased father the other roles are not as fully written and most remain rather one dimensional the movie is mainly sawa s however and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles tony todd s candyman as an arcane morgue attendant pops up for a five minute cameo but his appearance is rather supererogatory and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy ultimately what is so good about final destination is that within the confines of the slasher genre writer director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten two things that are rarely found in today s horror films if anything it s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again 
i love this movie and i ve just seen for the umptenth time unfortunately it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it it s my mission in life to spread the word see this movie fred george doug and howie are reaching middleage three of them have a wife kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay only fred is still a bachelor together they take the local train every morning to work in town on one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night since they always split everything four ways they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well kathy however kathy isn t completly honest to them in fact she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male with these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper ok have one thing clear though the romantic rendezvous between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent the script stays above the waist or to be precise above the neck noboyd claims that kathy is their mistress the four guys call her their companion the censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above years but that only shows how long ago was small children could watch this without being corrupted kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies i liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife tony randall is funny as always was more than years ago how many accountants copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work this is the white middle class i can t remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology 
field of dreams almost defies description although it s about baseball it s not a baseball movie although the film is extremely spiritual it s not about religion and although field of dreams is melodramatic it s not a tearjerker to really understand what field of dreams is all about you have to see it in the film kevin costner plays ray kinsella a baseball fan s berkeley graduate and iowa farmer one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields ray hears a voice it tells him if you build it he will come then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again and even though it depletes his family s savings and his neighbors think he s crazy ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field complete with bleachers and flood lights if you build it he will come and lo and behold shoeless joe does come bringing with him several of his dead teammates and then ray hears the voice again it tells him to ease his pain ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann an influential and radical novelist from the s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society with great aplomb james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey the cast in field of dreams is excellent especially kevin costner in the lead role costner gives a quiet subtle and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray s feisty and loving wife who against her better judgement supports her husband s crazy ideas in her most impressive scene madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p t a meeting displaying the sincere passion of a s berkeley radical ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the chicago black sox scandal and finally burt lancaster is memorable in a small but important role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life wonder mystery spirit and humor it for the most part succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief ray kinsella s spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama it unfortunately does at times go overboard and by the end it gets down right sappy in general however field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics

clint eastwood in his ripe old age is cashing one talent in for another midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood directed film clint isn t even in and it s damn good adapted from a best selling john berendt novel based on true events this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head and that s just the mayor as director and producer eastwood contributes a self indulgent but very competent minutes neatly balancing drama suspense and humor like all great movies midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves and not from some contrived juvenile intrusion the acting from big time stars john cusack and kevin spacey is as good as you d expect but it s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm cusack plays a free lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey s parties lots of food beverages and gunplay yes an employee of spacey s has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead it seems like a simple matter of self defense the guy threatened spacey shot at him missed then spacey took him out but being a movie there s much more to it than that and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in the weird circle of entertainment this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in there s the requisite sexy woman alison nepotist s daughter eastwood the strange piano player the voodoo woman and the transvestite miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his her own as the stealer of every scene she appears in what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony chablis playing herself is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul but never seems exploited as the movie s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey s lawyer both help immensely as does having the fly guy as the jury s foreman it s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey s homosexuality yes spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man before he shot him of course midnight in the garden of good and evil isn t a classic but it is one of the better celebrity directed true story best seller adaptations out there likewise no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations but the performances are all great in fact i d almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category serving america for more than th of a century 
you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to in order to make the film a success all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body it s basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner only adding a few modern twists essentially it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy not to mention very manipulative but oh how enjoyable that manipulation is but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does because i absolutely hated the previous ryan hanks teaming sleepless in seattle it couldn t have been the directing because both films were helmed by the same woman i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail but then again is that really important if you like something so much why even question it again the storyline is as cliched as they come tom hanks plays joe fox the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run children s book shop called in a nice homage the shop around the corner fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business little do they know they are already in love with each other over the internet only neither party knows the other person s true identity the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen sure there are some mildly interesting subplots but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship all of this of course leads up to the predictable climax but as foreseeable as the ending is it s so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love i was filled with such for lack of a better word happiness that for the first time all year i actually left the theater smiling 
many people dislike french films for their lack of closure while possibly shallow i ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany or at least a resolution in the films which i view there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional however the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion denying protagonist stephane daniel auteuil stephane daniel auteuil is a master violin maker he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing even the relationship between he and his boss maxime andre dussollier is a controlled and almost manipulated association highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches in the beginning of the movie stephane is a closed solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man camille kessler emmanuelle beart is a master violinist and the new love of maximes maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife like stephane camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges when stephane and camille meet there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals however whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him stephane ignores his feelings for camille which the audience cannot help but to see is present as the movie progresses the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another these two people with very similar approaches to life initially react to their new circumstance very differently stephane becomes even more rational and controlled while camille becomes more tempestuous until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship however their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well due to his relationship with a master violin teacher however apparently he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing consequently stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays in contrast camille had almost given the violin years earlier however with the aid of her manager she has progressed to being almost one of the world s finest successfully submerging herself to her playing during the course of the movie we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions stephane attempts to remain unchanged however we do see subtle hints of his transformation one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash the development of all of the characters many of which is not included in this synopsis is incredible american movies with rare exceptions have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development in its essence this movie is about the development and growth of the characters camille and stephane the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie including a death is to further the development of camille s and stepahne s characters i am not sure why berardinelli says at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified and it is to auteuil s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty this movie is not about judging stephane s actions as being right or wrong but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are i find the ending appropriate unfortunately i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling this portion of the film is where the sense of closure could have been successfully accomplished unfortunately there is a hurried and almost a soap opera type surge of emotions from all of the characters while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart ravel has his day in this film the synergism of the tension of ravel s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen the directing in this movie is wonderful the actors and actresses are excellent each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth emmanuelle beart s personality is beautiful and needless to say i must say that emmanuelle beart herself is beautiful besides the near ending the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot has their attitude towards love changed i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at but i am unsure of which the director is espousing in summary this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship in the process we see their attitude towards life and other people in itself i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we as americans have preconceived american notions of relationship love and people i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture however i bringing my american preconceptions enjoyed the film i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it 
that s the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into the wedding singer the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus does he draw laughs from his sad puppy dog expression and don t hate me for being a simpleton observations or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over well there s a little bit of all of that in the wedding singer and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr sandler s thing i did have a surprisingly good time that s because in a nutshell the wedding singer is one of the sweetest movies you re ever likely to come across that s right sweet the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh out loud hysterical but the tone well it s just lovely i have to admit i was half expecting farting armpit humor gratuitous nudity superfluous cloying subplots and some nasty unnecessary violence instead well i ve said it before sweet the year is and sandler plays robbie hart the eponymous wedding singer a job aspiring rock stars often settle for when robbie s fianc e dumps him at his own altar robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia drew barrymore who has some problems of her own she s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who unbeknownst to her isn t that big on monogamy it isn t giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love aww sandler and barrymore are a good match and they re assisted by some terrific cameo appearances including steve buscemi and jon lovitz whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film writer tim herlihy with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion it doesn t all work but it s handled with such light heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights sounds and affectations of the s the soundtrack an ever present force in the film is packed with wall to wall hits of the period new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol s white wedding to the smiths how soon is now to culture club s do you really want to hurt me the mix of music and fashion would make the wedding singer a great double feature with boogie nights if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs then the wedding singer is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride if you re a fan of the lovable laughable adam sandler well let s just say that the wedding singer might well be the only film in recent memory to make me want to rent happy gilmore 
eyes wide shut isn t the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick s final film but it is an impressive achievement a mesmerizing haunting adult psychodrama about marriage fidelity and sex it s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end consistently exhibiting the auteur s trademark penchant for long continuous takes his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast indeed eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot kubrick a renowned perfectionist reportedly held his cast hostage on the set for nearly a year in an uncharacteristic maneuver kubrick cast two big name stars in the lead roles namely real life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman they play bill and alice harford a volatile couple who during the course of a couple nights ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other he is an m d she s unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party at the affair they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman after smoking a dash of weed inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night he truthfully says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story evidently some time ago she had a thing for a young naval officer she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night bill is jolted by alice s story and we anticipate his reaction but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go show his face at the house of a just deceased patient this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street then through a series of coincidences he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic and frankly creepy orgy takes place with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other erotic dread mounts as cruise who s not supposed to be there wonders the spacious halls watching the action until he is discovered to be an outsider much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros digitally edited the orgy scene with the help of a computer they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts they can still be seen just not in all their glory in order to avoid the dreaded nc rating european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it roger ebert calls the american version the austin powers version and many others have bashed the alterations i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene s mystical atmosphere the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks this is an artful distinctively gorgeous production shot in dark moody hues and featuring some elaborate beautiful scenery from the giant mansion used in the film s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford s apartment this film is always a pleasure to look at to boot a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still at the core behind the graphic controversial content and unappealing mood this is a good natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic it s something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship at the end it seems bill s eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman tom is completely convincing as dr harford a man who seems guided solely by destiny with no control of the course his life will take nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective she s headed for an oscar nod the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast at the head of which is director cum thespian sidney pollock enigmatic and articulate as harford s mysterious friend eyes wide shut is not perfect the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander still this is an important work from a great director and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick s best it is a worthy final film a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness eugene novikov 
my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance or a movie that we ve all seen a million times two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins this is exactly what happened in this movie but fortunately they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way the movie starts with a quick and i do mean quick glance of two presidents russell kramer jack lemmon and matt douglas james garner william haney dan aykroyd and ted matthews john heard are the new president and vice president there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead this movie was exceptional for many reasons one being that they found people lemmon and garner that have good chemisty together they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly one being a ladies man and one being the old man i ll let you fiqure which is which also they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman except then he was a congressman experience counts for a lot 
barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks on the surface he s coming home for a high school reunion but since this is a movie you know that he s really looking for some major life decisions a fairly small film this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman rosie o donnell and a bunch of actors that you ve seen before but can t quite place commendable jobs all around they seem like real people hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spirit dead father terminally goony brother and old high school chums all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him the problem is that she is only unconsummated no it s not that type of movie their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it star crossed lovers with no where to go so hutton is gaga over a barely teen one of his buddies is two timing his girlfriend with a married old flame another s girlfriend is sleeping with a meat cutter and she s a vegetarian things are a mess enter uma thurman the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls her character is fun to watch even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her like the lone ranger before she leaves she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives the ending is a bit too pat everything is tied up with a neat little bow rosie o donnell is a stand out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and tell it like it is pronouncements structured somewhat like a diner a few years later this feel good story is a good time but ends a little too nice 
the film magnolia can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one magnolia is a clever well thought out film from prodigy director writer paul thomas anderson of boogie nights fame the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make magnolia memorable however what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories the film is never confusing anderson s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of magnolia s scenes drag on too long any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn t get boring it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees for example cop john c reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes races and genders suffer anderson s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get the performances in magnolia are perfection this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting anderson allows many of hollywood s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best character acting all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film worth noting is tom cruise who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon s character as phillip baker hall s wife she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film magnolia uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future 
jean luc picard patrick stewart and the rest of the crew of the u s s enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the s series star trek gone are kirk spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek the next generation as usual a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist s will it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction it doesn t do a bad job other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek fan only jokes while many of the others just fall flat the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet why do they have to be moved the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f murray abraham s aliens who number only a couple of dozen so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion at least that s plausible but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen which makes no sense whatsoever the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf michael dorn the trusty klingon worf was on star trek the next generation so they want to include him in the films no problem so far worf is now a character of star trek deep space nine so the writers have to find a way to have him show up in the last star trek movie first contact the included worf in a credible fashion in this one the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren t hanging on every word on the screen my minor problems with the movie aside star trek insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones while many of the jokes do miss the mark many are pretty good even for non trekkies the special effects are among the best for the star trek series the action is plentiful and well done this is a very good looking movie it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek the next generation that the acting is first rate it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series if you ve always hated star trek there is nothing here that is going to change your mind star trek insurrection is not the best film in the series but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones 
while watching boiler room i was constantly reminded of last year s masterpiece fight club both films consist of a predominately male cast both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped while boiler room writer director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire paying homage to oliver stone s classic wall street younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older more experienced types as is true in real life younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks some people are convinced that an all male cast automatically means there must be gory violence here is proof that this is not true if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck go see reindeer games this weekend if you want to see a smart insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script see boiler room giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film s narrator seth after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man nicky katt he agrees to take the job in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years of selling stock to well off americans from the mid west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co workers learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production seth figures this is too good to be true after stumbling into a room at the wrong time he knows there is something no good about this company at this point seth is left with the ultimate choice continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin playing seth s dad the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film the supporting cast of greedy co workers is also flawless ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable due to the lack of a major event boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller the romantic segments involving seth and abby nia long are not properly finalized and the dialogue isn t funny enough to make it a comedy in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole boiler room is slightly confused at times it doesn t seem to know which category to fit itself into one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better otherwise the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors 
it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst k tm he had never seen any episodes of the show and i have watched a scant few due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes for those of you not familiar with the premise dr clayton forrester beaulieu wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public to achieve this he in the words of the tv series theme which is missing in the movie bumped mike nelson nelson on the noggin and then shot him into space and is monitoring nelson s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions tom servo and crow t robot the format of the show consists of nelson servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched and breaks every minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love the ship on which our heroes are marooned only two things are different in the movie the absence of forrester s sidekick tv s frank and the slower pace of the jokes this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke for their big screen outing the producers have chosen this island earth a classic and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill unfortunately for that film but making it ideal mst k fodder acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which by today s standards are less than impressive nelson co make jokes about everything from japan s dominance in the world market to star trek to the state of disrepair of seattle s kingdome and most of them work unfortunately the segments set outside the satellite s movie theater seem out of place and aren t particularly funny but at least they re fairly short the big question about this movie though is why i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen there are no special effects to dazzle you no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat and no use of digital surround sound so it seems pointless to spend per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts nevertheless mst k tm provides more laugh out loud opportunities than any film you re going to see this year and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse given its uniqueness i hesitate to grade it against other films but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b movies it does well 
some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen i finished mike figgis leaving las vegas hours ago and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr alot of people refer to this film as that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude leaving las vegas is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are a drunk and a whore ben nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years is the drunk his family and friends have long since abandon him and all he has left is his liquor in a scene early in the film we see ben staggering into a resteraunt looking for a friend of his to mooch some money off of he finds the guy richard lewis having dinner with a buddy and two chicks trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid when ben approaches the table you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable after lewis gives ben the money he coldly says i think it would be best if you didn t contact me again now even though through the course of the film some much more depressing things happen this is when i felt the most for ben there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face not to sound hokey or anything it almost brought a tear to my eye it turns out that ben was once a semi successful hollywood player and apparently a pretty popular guy now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women not so much for the sex but for the company for someone to talk to or spend time with once he is fired from his job ben decides to burn all his belongings collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death one night he runs into a prostitute a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue how far she has come since adventures in babysitting named sera she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp a scumbag who gets off by cutting her they are both very lonely self destructive people they immediatly hit it off both of them realizing that they need one another and it isn t even a sexual relationship they don t even have sex until like the last ten minutes of the film leaving las vegas is not a film about plot with the exception of what i have already revealed which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so by the way there isn t too much of a story to it it is more a film about people and how they react to one another from what i can see this is basically a perfect film the direction is great with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody smokey atmosphere of a film noir and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the s or any other decade for that matter but don t go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you re getting yourself into first off if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge stay away from leaving las vegas it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon that s right secondly if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film don t see it however if you are cool with those two things you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have 
i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory this was of course a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this not only did i get to see an advance screening i was able to see an advance screening of a very good movie the very fast paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher a fast talking witty comical taxi driver in new york city gibson s performance is terrific and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films gibson again teams up with richard donner as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick and this time around the combination works even better the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique try to imagine a toned downed version of travis bickle who this time around is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover ups if you can imagine that then you ve basically got jerry fletcher in many ways i was surprised by this movie to begin with i was surprised at how good it was don t get me wrong it s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring but it was a very enjoyable movie secondly i was surprised at mel gibson s performance he provided a fantastic performance the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all out action flick which after viewing it was almost the opposite in a certain sense gibson s character has an almost uncountable number of one liners hilarious situations and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film for instance jerry s apartment and especially his security is memorable and last i was surprised at how good the plot is writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story and when watching this film you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher s far fetched or so they seem at first conspiracy theories are helgeland s own opinions mel gibson isn t the only stand out in the film julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton the department of justice employee who can t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories he also seems obsessed and in love with her but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories she shrugs him and his beliefs off continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him jerry obviously determined to continually seek out the truth continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory which will be printed in his newsletter same title as the movie although he only has five subscribers he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work and publishes his next edition very soon after he does so he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr jonas patrick stewart after barely escaping alive jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust alice sutton the remainder of the film is almost always fast paced and full of action and suspense with jerry s life being constantly put into jeopardy and more along the way the audience and alice learn more and more about jerry s life many things are explained throughout this film both to the characters and to the audience for instance the meaning of the book the catcher in the rye and its ties to assassins the reason lone gunmen have three names e g lee harvey oswald and james earl ray and the real truth behind the grateful dead make sure listen closely throughout the film as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above definitely when conspiracy theory hits theaters august th make sure you are standing in line to see it i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film especially if you are into an action thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations and even if you aren t you should still like this film 
cinema has been around for about a hundred years now it s not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film but i d like to think that i m beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time recently i ve seen the films of hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius they are likely to be remembered for well quite a while i like this film too yes it s a disaster slash action movie true its budget is a lot more money than i ll ever see in my lifetime and there s not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money in fact i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film had they thought it would ve been more profitable i certainly don t care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such a skilled director that i doubt he d ever make a film that is difficult to sit through of course skillful direction doesn t complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together the story is well thought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters yes you read that right armageddon actually has characters you can care about if you don t like this film then you have a problem with the genre itself armageddon is as good as a film like this can be if you ve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film so it s up to the u s government to stop it why the u s is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated their plan to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate a nuclear warhead within the head driller is harry stamper bruce willis his group of men is a colorful bunch including a j ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi there s also an interesting triangle formed between a j harry and grace liv tyler who is harry s daughter a j and grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad isn t too happy with the situation it s absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you d like to call armageddon it s not about story it s about viscera and action and thrills a minute and all that stuff it s incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens but bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better i think most of the budget went to cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles take the spectacular opening scene for instance in which a meteor shower obliterates new york a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars the action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways i like his quick edit style because it s abrasive and exhausting to watch it s also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times but it s fun to be obnoxious sometimes the special effects in this film put every other blockbuster to shame deep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable special effects are very important in a film like this if they re not good then the image is not convincing and the film doesn t work everything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid the effects that don t look totally real are still a pleasure to behold and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice looking that it actually qualifies as art of course all of this would add up to little more than an above average light show if i didn t get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action the film is two and a half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots i won t suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions aren t put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way in fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and that s a lot more than i can say about deep impact which was banking on the feel good parts of its story bruce willis is terrific and i m glad to see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing tyler and affleck are great together and make a convincing couple all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level patton who is a magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his ex wife and son is very moving the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays a crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keeps the film lively and funny i wasn t challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon and i don t mind too much but the film doesn t insult my intelligence it s pitched perfectly to entertain which is what all it really wants to do it s not mindless and escapist but well crafted cinema it might have been created for the wrong reasons but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good in spite of the producers and the budget i m not saying that films like this are risky moves what i am saying is that armageddon is a big loud expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms 
that thing you do r tom hanks s screenwriting and directorial debut that thing you do has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment fun lively and oh so nice it is the latter quality however that becomes a hindrance for this s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast that thing focuses on the wonders a teen rock band from erie pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in when they score a major dance hit called of course that thing you do the group s members are naturally a diverse group there s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy johnathon schaech girl crazy lenny steve zahn the lead guitarist a goofy geeky type known only as the bass player ethan embry and the film s center guy tom everett scott the drummer who has aspirations in jazz along for the wonders ride to success is jimmy s perpetually neglected galpal faye liv tyler hanks proves to be a capable writer director deftly recreating the innocent spirit of which hanks calls the last innocent year the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music which like the other recent period music film grace of my heart was expressly written for the film hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled it s still playing in my mind as i write this it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors eliciting charming likable work from the entire cast most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler who is remarkable in delivering the film s biggest and best dramatic moment the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early s they do not appear to be s grungers playacting retro yet for all the light frothy charms of that thing you do it s nearly nice to a fault while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting everyone is so happy basking in the glow of overnight success marvelling at it all except toward the end but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness ending on an appropriately feel good note there isn t much of an edge throughout that thing the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks s turn as the wonders manager and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it s bland but a little niceness goes a long way these days and there s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do it s just about impossible to hate it s an inoffensive enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming if not singing that thing you do quite possibly for days to paraphrase a passage from the song though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play that thing you do

earlier this year the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics a real charmer of a movie it s possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience now at the end of comes waking ned devine a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter there s no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere they strike all the same chords but still ned devine is a movie worth seeing the plot is interesting and robust the latest lottery winner is ned devine jimmy keogh of tullymore ireland ned s prize is over six million pounds but the shock of winning killed the poor old man and the check remains unclaimed enter jackie o shea ian bannen and michael o sullivan david kelly the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village the two men eventually find the ticket and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he s actually ned the entire town can reap the benefits their only adversary is an ancient old woman eileen dromey who sees more profit in reporting the fraud ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael jackie stocky and large is the brains behind the operation michael scrawny and short is the method man the two contrast each other delightfully and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience every viewer is sure to like both of them there are other minor subplots included as well such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer this appears quite inconsequential until the end and even with a startling revelation it s a tad bit unnecessary overall waking ned devine has a predictable outcome and plot twists are never really taken seriously the ending a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout the kirk jones script is indeed off the cuff in a way waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents warm friendly outgoing and jovial it s the perfect kind of comedy a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes there s nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one indeed it s one of the year s best feel good movies minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss 
at first glance it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of year olds that s true of home alone and i d bet money that it s true of home alone opening soon but home alone actually has a lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesn t get in the way the mcalisters all of them are going to france for the holidays four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse the littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kids cruelty kevin s patience runs out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza has already been eaten and he s going to have to starve he attacks his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him the fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table a few cousins and an uncle the knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased but they all point their fingers when he fights back the ultimate punishment comes from mom catherine o hara who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night on his way up the stairs he tells her that families suck and that he hopes never to see any of his family again that night the power goes out knocking out the alarm clocks so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport in a surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family heads off without him it s interesting that in a subtle way his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling and second they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class they re two thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child meanwhile kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true he s finally rid of his family life is a dream come true he can jump on the beds watch r rated movies eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips and dig through his big brother s secret box slowly the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane he grooms himself he does the laundry he goes shopping i bought some milk eggs and fabric softener he also starts to miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring the furnace in the basement is a scary monster the old man next door is a snow shovel murderer and two crooks are trying to break into his house macaulay culkin is cute but he isn t much of an actor still we can see that kevin s character grows thanks to some good direction and editing for example acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night just as santa is getting in his car kevin asks the man to pass on his request he wants his family back to the real santa he learned how to deal with the furnace you turn on the lights and it s not so scary anymore he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow shovel murderer who actually turns out to be a nice man they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid finally in the last minutes kevin confronts his last fear the bandits head on literally this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movie s genuine dramatic setup it is dessert it s a lot of fun and it doesn t overwhelm the rest of the movie on the whole home alone is a great holiday movie john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings but it does have its flaws the smallest problem is that culkin doesn t act very well as i said before he is cute but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin s insight into his character the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villains threaten kevin s life about five times instead of i m gonna get that kid they say i m gonna kill that kid some might argue that the tone is the same but i strongly disagree mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux pas i ll probably never see home alone and i wish i had skipped home alone but i do enjoy home alone almost every year don t let your impressions of the others detract from the original which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick 
it s hard not to recommend the others the supernatural thriller written and directed by alejandro amen bar open your eyes adroitly establishes and maintains a low key atmosphere of menace the cinematography by javier aguirresarobe is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied overall the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old twilight zone episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented only to learn they are actually a child s toy a military test subject or a department store dummy watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter i always wanted to shout get on with it as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in the others my reaction was much the same set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii the story focuses on grace kidman who tends to her children anne alakina mann and nicholas james bentley and worries about her husband charles christopher eccleston a missing serviceman anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all doors protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time at the beginning of the film three servants mrs mills fionnula flanagan young mute lydia elaine cassidy and mr tuttle eric sykes an aging gardener join the family the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not to make matters worse the children are upset nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them that s essentially the whole story with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear earlier there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog the visuals in the otherworldly sequence courtesy of aguirresarobe are simply astounding i also enjoyed the presence of religion a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural grace is a christian and answers her children s questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper when mother is away though the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore just as real children do but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending the others sets out to be a classic ghost story but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist 
 take a number fill out a form and wait your turn starring kati outinen kari v n nen sakari kuosmanen elina salo written directed by aki kaurism ki cinematography by timo salminen it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy but that would imply a sense of anger of vitriol of energy drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone it is the sad slow story of lauri and ilona a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward he loses his job as a tram driver because everyone drives cars nowadays within a couple of months she loses her position as a head waiter when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv which she greets with little enthusiasm she notes that they haven t finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn t spoken with such resigned weariness this sets the tone for the rest of the movie there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery but at the centre there is frustration and futility and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal the movie is about two people and what happens to them and nothing else matters lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship respect culture passion they go to the movies and walk out past old posters for l atalante and l argent but the movie they have just seen is a pointless violent unfunny comedy their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ugly greens dull reds insipid blues full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness and director aki kaurism ki often matches the colour of characters clothes with the background colour and or lighting so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love their downward downsized downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic as one setback succeeds another bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs more farce more deadpan wit but the film s great strength is the sober empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona s misfortunes irony would be an injustice situations and settings are broad and exaggerated this is not realism but they are not distorted the emotions are authentic if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens despite the droll performances the laconic humour that s because kaurism ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty eight who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two bit restaurant how humiliating it must be for a man nearing to confront his wife s former employer demanding the rest of her wages only to have the crap beaten out of him unable to land a single punch when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money all this is observed keenly with great economy every cut every line of dialogue is judicious if most films are novelistic in their telling this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the minute running length i have seen many movies far less profound less humane less necessary than drifting clouds but they filled me with an urge to watch them again and this one did not it does not need to be seen twice its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience because it cannot be pitched to one there is no selling point it is all understatement restraint melancholy the characters are unremarkable their best years behind them their dreams dissipated it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills this does not make them less fascinating merely less marketable which is a shame because this is a movie which should be seen precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore it engages us and touches us and resolves surprisingly and movingly into something resembling a happy ending the only thing greater than the ill luck that governs the characters lives is their refusal to give in to despair their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a feel good ending elsewhere but not here because this ending differs in kind from most such endings this one has truly been earned 
as the film opens up expectant unwed mother sally played by drew barrymore encounters her baby s father in a fast food drive through window after he gets his milkshake he drives off only to be pursued by a military helicopter from this moment forward you know that this isn t going to be your run of the mill romantic comedy home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian played by luke wilson a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally more than he would care to admit hint it has something to do with the father of sally s unborn child after taking a personal and professional interest in her he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works and the fun goes on from there this movie is a lot of fun it is comedic on two levels as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy the romantic moments are sweet yet not sappy one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes however the dark comedic moments are more memorable this is also a tale of revenge and a funny one at that the father of sally s unborn child also happened to be a married man whose wife is played by catherine o hara she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work my apologies if this sounds cryptic but there is too much of the plot to give away rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus dorian s overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy dorian s trainer at the fast food restaurant the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones even with the romantic nature of the plot if there are any complaints it is over drew barrymore s performance while she does light up the screen there are moments when she doesn t seem all that convincing the movie was filmed in texas and most of the characters have southern texan accents drew barrymore s accent tends to come and go luke wilson doesn t seem to have this problem as well she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant still this movie is one that will please many viewers with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments this is sure to entertain 
star wars episode i the phantom menace review a review by jamey hughton stars starring liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman and jake lloyd director george lucas rated g with all the hype that star wars episode the phantom menace has been receiving it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago in a galaxy far far away yes this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity but that doesn t mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment the phantom menace features the most eye catching jaw dropping visual look in cinematic history the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest and the special effects are nothing short of the best and most plentiful to ever be caught on film the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses even if it has some disappointing aspects after we re treated to the famous prologue in the sky with john williams thundering score we meet qui gon jonn liam neeson and young obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor a jedi master and his trainee padawan they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo oh but enough about that the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker jake lloyd into the picture as you already know this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter this particular race is the most exciting energetic high octane action sequence that you ll ever see one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised and the phantom menace is no exception i loved sebulba the rat like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race and boss nass the leader of the gungans who are a neighbouring species to naboo one character who has been subject to criticism is jar jar binks a member of the gungan race jar jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief yes he is initially annoying but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless goofy antics there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses the final light saber battle between the jedi s and the horrific and terminally underused villain darth maul is spectacular to behold jabba the hutt yoda c po and r d have cameo appearances lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments episode s i and ii when they arrive you ll know where to find me 
well i ll be damned what a most excellent surprise not to be confused with the campy and far inferior remake starring ex porn star traci lords this more recent attempt at remaking the s drive in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci fi flick of once again b movie king roger corman is behind this effort he directed the original but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries because it s an absolute must see for sci fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent the plot in brief paul johnson michael york is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who though needing to kill people to live is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure the key of which lies in the blood of humans he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr rochelle whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda elizabeth barondes to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires but before long amanda and johnson s sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric i must admit my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech the dapper clothes and cool spectacles the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character york is by turns hilarious menacing and tragic this is a tour de force and quite simply the best performance i ve seen from him and while obviously made on a modest budget the film boasts enormous strengths the casting is spot on the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent witty and consistently engaging cleverly updating the original the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect a marked contrast to the earlier remake from the film doesn t drag for a second of its minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little known director terrance h winkless and it doesn t matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy this is schlock after all even if it is high class schlock in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life threatening situation but these are minor complaints just see it not of this earth is one of the biggest sci fi surprises in years and michael york in one cool swoop you ve made yourself a b movie legend dude 
by now i figured i d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half dozen times not that i m complaining to call him the master of suspense is an understatement the paradine case admittedly one of hitchcock s lesser movies turned out to be one i d missed this one like all hitchcock films is well worth savoring the story opens with the rich mrs maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband as mrs paradine alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world to franz waxman s stark and moody music we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels stripped of her fine raiment she becomes a commoner again which as it turns out was what she was before she met her husband a brief skirmish and you ll be lunching at the savoy again anthony keane her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting predicting a fast and easy trial gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister she s no murderess he argues simplistically smitten by her beauty she s too fine a woman his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife gay ann todd unlike most hitchcock movies which are centered on the thriller and the mystery this one is more a romantic melodrama typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light she deflects her husband s affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs paradine s portrait nearby in the relatively unsatisfying first half little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs paradine acquitted because if mrs paradine dies his heart will go with her if she is freed he will be able to forget her as part of the soap opera a mysterious louis jordan plays mr paradine s valet who has had some not to be discussed relationships charles coburn plays anthony s legal partner sir simon flaquer and charles laughton who looks like coburn is judge lord horfield this being proper british society they will all dine together at the judge s house not long before the case begins court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences some subtle and others not between the american and the british judicial systems one for example of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations as the judge s wife lady sophie horfield ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress the film s only nomination for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk on at minutes into the film he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case don t miss it in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial s action as anthony explains it the simple case has only possibilities mr paradine poisoned himself mrs paradine did it or the valet did it the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid the paradine case runs the picture is in black and white it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested 
the rocky horror picture show special edition starring tim curry and susan sarandon cult films are never mainstream the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused yelling out what the hell is that fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the hidden jokes they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they re insane the rocky horror picture show recently re released in a special edition to video is the mother of all cult films period like some other cult films most notably little shop of horrors the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it this movie begins out innocently enough a couple get engaged at a friend s wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it s raining they go to a castle to try to use the phone little do they know that the castle is owned by dr frank n furter a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons the acting is pretty good overall tim curry home alone legend is over the top as frank n furter it s interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon s dead man walking first film she plays janet the girlfriend of brad majors even the singer meatloaf is in it the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way a sampling of titles range from damn it janet to touch a touch a touch a touch me all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors kind of a bad thing barry bostwick brad majors tries to sing as does susan sarandon but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience meatloaf sings like meatloaf the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version sadly the songs are tacked after the credits kind of defeats the purpose if you want to see a different film watch this one 
since the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style now instead of emphasizing feel good stories replete with characters of noble virtues the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times as s schindler s list shows most of today s mainstream drama however creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience that s why pictures like october sky which are a throwback to the good ol dramas of yesteryear are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam jake gyllenhaal a teenager in the s company town of coalwood west virginia it s a well known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships the rest grow up to work in the coal mine the mine which is run by homer s father chris cooper is not the place for homer however after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in homer feels a connection with the outside world as he puts it anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast homer begins to construct rockets with the help of their history teacher miss riley laura dern and several mine workers the four are soon bound for great things october sky is a skillfully crafted film and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston johnston whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars certainly knows what he s doing here he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust he does not push any barriers but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film s charm his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers or the silent struggle between homer s mother and father the cast is well chosen although the true bright spots are the supporting roles laura dern jurassic park lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher giving the boys the support and guidance they need her role is instantly likeable chris cooper the horse whisperer as homer s father is less likeable even downright despicable at times but his turn here gives gravity to the movie he s definitely a driving force in homer s life and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable the script is generally cheerful projecting the boys endeavors in a lighthearted manner there are moments when it becomes predictable such as the train tracks scene and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist it highlights the essence of youth however and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps october sky should be a success with audiences although it doesn t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she s all that it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards it s a welcome change to the dramatic genre and one that everyone should see 
it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of the horse whisperer the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to projection difficulties robert redford s film version of nicholas evans best selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december going head to head with titanic but is only now making its much anticipated debut this strategic delay has allowed the horse whisperer to compete sans fanfare against some smaller unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office no matter redford s film stands head and shoulders above james cameron s ocean going tragedy especially in the writing and acting departments whatever the reasons for its postponement the horse whisperer supports the old adage better late than never redford has taken evans book and given it the big screen treatment while parts of the horse whisperer are epic in scope and vision especially the aerial travelogue that maps out this great country of ours its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast when her daughter grace is involved in a terrible riding accident hard driven fashion editor annie maclean kristin scott thomas devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace s beloved horse pilgrim refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker redford who has a way with horses and perhaps with people too undeterred by tom s initial reluctance to get involved annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal redford s film unfolds slowly and lovingly echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds the film s a little long and even if you haven t read the book it s pretty obvious where it s heading but these are minor complaints redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other but it s scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role dianne wiest chris cooper lone star and sam neill better than i ve seen him before round out the respectable supporting cast and the director s respect for horses is clearly in evidence one word of warning however while brilliantly shot the accident scene involving an out of control truck is extremely disturbing redford s canvas is huge and exquisite he doesn t hesitate to incorporate vast sprawling vistas of the american northwest spectacular snow capped mountain ranges azure skies and shimmering fields of wheat all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson s viewfinder veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity since the horse whisperer is dances with wolves by way of out of africa oscar winners both for barry fortunately barry s replacement thomas newman contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate human conditions sonorous string laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic introspective movements ripe with nuance the horse whisperer is that rare kind of movie it looks good it feels good and by golly it does you good the wait it turns out was well worth it 
plot a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes he is taken prisoner along with some other humans and tries his best to escape his simian captors oh yeah and did i mention that the apes can talk kewl critique despite this film not looking like a tim burton movie or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun summer fare although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make up jobs and characterizations i mean i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real i also have to give it up to all of the actors inside the costumes not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make up slobbered all over them for hours but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well i especially enjoyed bonham carter s performance who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film human or ape and tim roth s bad guy who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part plot wise i liked the beginning of the film the whole build up once wahlberg got into the village the escape and most of the fight scenes but once things got out into the deserted area and the final battle sequence i kinda lost a bit of my interest i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of human beings as animals then i was about the end battle sequence which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film i also hated the kid character who just got on my nerves and didn t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved i won t ruin it here but c mon guys you coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that no but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter species love interests this dude didn t seem to give a rat s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn t really care about what happened to him either now i m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script but the film suffered because of it visually the movie was also nice to look at especially the apes but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton the surprise ending that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in felt a little tacked on here and despite being interesting didn t really make all that much sense to me unless you look at it from a sequel point of view so overall i loved the whole feel of the planet the apes that ruled it the manner in which they treated the humans screamed shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain but didn t appreciate the film s lack of human character development why was kris kristofferson even in this movie and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring but i would still recommend this film as a fun summer movie with laughs creepiness and a really cool premise ps for anyone who has seen the original i cannot believe that they didn t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character in this case mark wahlberg goes nuts at the world in which he s suddenly been thrust this is a mad house type of thing the guy in this film barely seems to be put off by the fact that he s surrounded by apes who can speak english where s joblo coming from the arrival battlefield earth godzilla instinct mission to mars pitch black planet of the apes sleepy hollow 
 crazy beautiful suffers from the damned if you do damned if you don t syndrome after a spate of flighty cookie cutter teen films the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story but rather than applaud the production early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown afterschool special even worse in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people the studio got a case of the heebie jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re shoot scenes and cut footage to tone things down needless to say the filmmaker was frustrated we were trying to make a cautionary tale he told newsweek and we couldn t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from regardless the film works thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes crazy beautiful is quality fare good enough that i half expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes set in pacific palisades calif the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens every morning and evening carlos nunez jay hernandez takes a two hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school an honor student and star athlete carlos is responsible modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy all is well until he meets nicole oakley kirsten dunst the daughter of a rich congressman bruce davison nicole is a drunk apparently hell bent on self destruction carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her but he is only human and she has the greatest smile plus as her father notes she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral as with save the last dance crazy beautiful god how i hate lower case titles takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh while noting the racial and social differences between the kids the screenplay dances around most of the clich s there are still several mtv moments though the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there cute as a button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole s behavior she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down i hoped the boy would listen as carlos hernandez is a revelation hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team the young man can really act we will see a lot of this guy in the future aside from its title the biggest problem with crazy beautiful is its ending which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy after carefully presenting credible characters and situations the conclusion feels rushed and lazy still this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots afterschool special my ass crazy beautiful is the real deal 
the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house from there things become a little more complicated i can say with absolute assurance that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me although i know it was all a staged mockumentary there s no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you i didn t feel much upon initially watching it i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend i ve gotten chills every time i ve brought it up since then this is not a movie that hits you right away instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine waits until you think everything is okay then it slowly starts to creep it s way up into your mind this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch the film is comprised of home video and mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film so don t expect any steadi cam shots or fancy camera work this is as real as it gets folks i don t recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape to film transfer done for the big screen word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras hours of deleted scenes alternate endings commentary the sci fi channel special and others is being planned for release i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd s i know i ll be first in line to buy one r 
the first thing you notice about this movie is that it s cold placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow covered ground against a background of white just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night as with most coen brothers films this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes each of which works out in the oddest way possible a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does in brief scenes of vicious violence people get shot through the head in the back face chest and various other areas of the anatomy there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen remarkably enough most of the movie is played for laughs even more remarkably it works the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff frances mcdormand who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity with every good film the audience gains new knowledge here you learn two things everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy and don t do violent illegal business with low life amoral degenerate scum sucking losers oh yeah if you get shot in the face using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy 
whenever writer director robert altman works in a specific genre he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms he made the west dirty in mccabe and mrs miller he parodied hard boiled detective stories in the long goodbye and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with popeye the same holds true for his most recent film the gingerbread man which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years the john grisham movie by the time the gingerbread man was completed there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham there s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise matthew mcconaughey chris o donnell or matt damon and it doesn t feature a great showdown in a courtroom instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession the gingerbread man is a rain soaked southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters a twisting plot line black humor a somewhat bleak ending and even altman s trademark full frontal female nudity the central character of the film is rick magruder who is unlike any of grisham s other lawyer heroes he is older experienced and rich he drives a cherry red mercedes that never gets dirty even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah georgia where the story unfolds rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife leeanne famke janssen and he rarely gets to see his two children jeff jesse james and libby mae whitman a reason is never given for the divorce but it isn t hard to surmise that rick s womanizing had a large part in it whenever he s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days leeanne always assumes it s because he s been screwing around after an office party celebrating another of his court victories he hasn t lost in eight years rick becomes involved with mallory doss embeth davidtz one of the catering waitresses he drives her home because her car has been stolen and they end up in bed together rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father dixon doss robert duvall a grungy stringy bare footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers it was actually dixon who stole her car that night and when rick asks why mallory replies that he always does weird stuff like that as another character puts it dixon is a few beers short of six pack rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell a private investigator friend robert downey jr and testimony from mallory s begrudging ex husband pete randle tom berenger dixon is put in a mental hospital but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out from there the story delves into kidnapping murder double crossing and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action altman s cinematographer changwei gu gives the film a dark soaked look if it isn t night time at least it s raining gu shoots the interiors which are almost all dark wood paneling with a minimum of light a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability in the city there is danger enough but when rick has to venture into the woods you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre from westerns to epic dramas to comedies but no matter what the genre he is always sure to give it the altman stamp which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings the gingerbread man is no different although his style is much more restrained here however without those little touches the film could have easily slumped into a routine action thriller a great deal of the credit for the film s success can be given to the actors especially branagh who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction here the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic rick is an extremely flawed man but branaugh brings real humanity to his character without it the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick s pain and frustration the supporting actors also put in fine performances including embeth davidtz who is probably best known for her heart breaking role as the jewish maid in schindler s list tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief and robert duvall spends most of his on screen time just looking weird it doesn t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue but watch him closely during the film s one courtroom scene his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing while the gingerbread man isn t in league with altman s greatest works like nashville or the player it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career some critics love to stamp films like this as commercial as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don t make money altman has done something much better he took what could have been a generic movie and by investing artistry and effort he made it into something more 
there s a thin line between satire and controversy and mike nichols the birdcage wolf has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election based on the book written by anonymous actually former newsweek writer joe klein john travolta plays governor jack stanton but he doesn t actually play stanton he plays bill clinton just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville although the credits will of course say otherwise the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton adrian lester a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations and whether it be keeping the history of his boss pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers richard jemmons billy bob thorton and daisy green maura tierney team up with henry as the would be president s advisors and hire lesbian veteran libby holden kathy bates as the campaign s eccentric tougher than dirt incriminator together they face all sorts of sexual allegations the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race in its satire and controversy primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it s characters letting us understand what they want and why and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look and the rest of the cast also make superb performances adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden at occasions you can t help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste there are long slabs of time where john travolta unquestionably the most interesting to watch is missed from the screen and since it is awkwardly structured as henry s story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot or even the point of the film having said that make no mistake primary colors is always enjoyable to watch but frequently we have to ask ourselves exactly what are we watching most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary and almost unsuitable to the rest of the film but as i mentioned before there is a thin line between satire and controversy and for the most part primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far from overpowering look at winning the public s opinion although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is thankfully it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it s scary 
 rebel without a cause is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to everyone feels that they are different in some way that they don t belong in some places and rebel without a cause successfully shows on screen these universal emotions no matter what generation you belong to these feelings are present this is why james dean is admired by america because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute in our minds we just try to do the right thing just like dean s jim stark does not only does rebel without a cause display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection this is because times change and in response people change no matter how popular you were once as your generation grows older newer breeds look at you in a different light this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past the teens could not believe this in one humorous scene stark his girlfriend judy natalie wood and his pal plato sal mineo pretend they are adults they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another speaking on behalf of my generation i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation same goes for brando redford even deniro i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon ben affleck and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film even if rebel without a cause has some ridiculous scenes the game of chicken did people really act this way an unbelievable conclusion how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end and a silly romance wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours it still is a fabulous film the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool now however the coolness is fading 
when andy leaves for cowboy camp his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys one of these toys is wheezy a penguin with a broken squeaker woody tom hanks saddles up andy s dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy woody succeeds in his mission but doesn t make it back to the house before al the unscrupulous owner of al s toy barn recognizes woody as a rare collector s item and steals him buzz lightyear tim allen leads hamm john ratzenberger mr potato head don rickles slinky dog jim varney and rex wallace shawn into the city to find their friend meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped al has collected every piece of merchandising from the s tv puppet show woody s round up except for a woody doll now that the collection is complete al plans to sell woody and his round up gang bullseye the horse jessie the cowgirl joan cusack and stinky pete the old prospector kelsey grammer to a toy museum in japan the gang is happy about the move they ve been in storage for years waiting for woody if woody doesn t go with them they ll be closed up in a dark box again possibly forever trying to convince him to stay with them jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy buzz and the boys invade al s toy barn where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn t know he s a toy the new buzz generates the movie s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on zurg s fortress i e al s apartment building the original toy story won me over because its central themes reflected a grown up sensibility rather than the usual this is what we think kids want to hear while most kids movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill in toy story buzz discovered that he wasn t special that he was just like everyone else buzz sank into a suicidal depression but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy in other words it s okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we re not space rangers and we re never going to be toy story addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded abandoned or sealed up in a dark box in the attic this is another big grown up theme everything ends the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody s arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp on the shelf woody meets wheezy who s dusty broken and forgotten the other toys are shocked that woody has been shelved and they worry that woody s ride out to the cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt after he s stolen woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals of course in spite of the heavy themes toy story explores it s also very funny most of the laughs come from the toys assault on al s toy barn and on the apartment building the brief substitution of a new still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise i d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original most of the vocal performances are first rate tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work however one voice over also stands out as horribly miscast kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector although he does a lot of voice over work in commercials and on the simpsons as sideshow bob grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice he doesn t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete the animation is even better than in the first especially impressive were the textures of the figures we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic in the first movie the people looked just like the toys but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint we can also see that bo peep is porcelain as you can tell from the long winded phrasing common in the merchandising disney and pixar s toy story this is pixar s coming out party to celebrate they appended their first project a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball to the beginning of the movie they made the short in which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then on the downside toy story follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale and some sections tend to drag overall though i had a great time and found story to be a worthy successor to the first toy story bottom line this one really is fun for the whole family

first i am not a big fan of the x files tv series i have nothing against it particularly i just don t happen to watch it having said that i can now say that i liked the x files pretty well for us non fans there s nothing big going for it but there are a lot of little things the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in b c two proto humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy lucas black from sling blade is captured by the same black ooze we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder gillian anderson and david duchovny who have been pulled off of their previous assignment investigations into the paranormal and put onto the bomb squad detail a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas texas on a hunch mulder checks out the building across the street and wouldn t you know it he turns out to be right the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse five people die in the blast and when mulder learns who the victims were a light bulb goes on over his head the two agents team up to investigate against fbi orders the links mulder has made their search leads them back to the north texas cave all across the country and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to the truth the plot and the truth are uninspired i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me it didn t the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them but the point of the x files is not what the truth is but the extent to which it has been hidden it s a slightly more interesting angle but it still raises expectations about that truth too high if this were the whole film i would say the movie was mediocre perhaps even boring but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest before the audience can get tired of one location the agents follow a hot tip to another location and so on and so forth the locations are not all computer generated sets either there are some artificial settings but the desert night of nevada the edge of suburbia in texas and the endless fields of snow in antarctica actually somewhere in north america make this fantastic film feel more real ward russell s cinematography is very good the overall look is dark and ominous appropriate to the intended tone of the film s plot russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding when the movie is set in darkness the picture quality is still rich and detailed finally and specifically there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train i don t know if the shot is faked in any way but it looks dangerous and it looks great the movie s soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film skip to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie there is a spoiler in the following sentences during the opening prehistoric sequence a howling wind dogs the soundtrack never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound in one of the movie s most effective sequences metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees the visuals of the scene are good but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound there was no question as to who the movie s stars would be even so duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination both are easy on the eyes and together they have some good timing banter and energy there is a hint of chemistry between them but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street there might be some romantic interest but for now they re more interested in their environs than they are in each other no single element really makes this movie outstanding not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular but enough things were done right that the x files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along 
october sky is a rare oddity in cinema a self proclaimed uplifting film that is actually uplifting based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam rocket boys october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream it s and for the boys of coalwood west virginia there s not much hope of a rosy future coalwood is a coal mining town and except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship most of coalwood s boys are destined to work in the mine but in october an event happens that sparks one boy to dream the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam jake gyllenhaal to dream a future of rocketry and space travel of course homer s parents chris cooper and natalie canderday aren t quite sure what to make of their son s unusual interests homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley laura dern a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair and so with stars in his eyes and thoughts of scholarships in his head homer enlists the help of three other boys william lee scott chad lindberg and chris owen and begins to build a rocket but do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched however miraculously october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls making the exact right moves at the exact right times a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film from the outset of the film he is immediately likable and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience unfortunately while october sky focuses on homer the other three kids get the short end of the stick they remain little more than placeholders reading insert friend here of the adults in the film chris cooper is the most fully realized character the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child s dreams but instead shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town but is too stubborn to realize what that is director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge however there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial however these lapses are minimal and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course the problem with many so called uplifting films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat october sky never resorts to that level and yet manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits 
it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship a green ovular pin and the birth of oscar wilde but if one really strains they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off wilde s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned loosing his family and his career the glam rock movement in the early s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else and that s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began it s been said that todd haynes velvet goldmine the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it steals a lot from citizen kane and that s true in the film a british journalist in the s arthur stuart christian bale is asked to go back and find out what happened to s glam rock star brian slade a fictitious rock star who faked his own death on stage bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement structure wise this totally steals from kane not only from the set up he interviews three people and the story is a result of their flashbacks but in other things like the beginning death then newsreel and smaller details like the bitter ex friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex wife as a washed up lounge singer found in a bar after hours this is no kane and it really doesn t aspire to be it doesn t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like kane did and it doesn t really uncover anything poignant about humanity instead it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants the s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging but the s scenes are engaging though not to mention addictively campy they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era and a feel that s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then footage they become not only a symbol of decadence but of times when everything seemed so simple instead of creating the world the way it was haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you ve experienced it everything else seems so mundane there s no outside world to speak of secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero curt wild and their relationship that created molded and then brought down the movement reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that contributors blade played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers and wild played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop respectively complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one time partners in music but also partners in bed through discussions with slade s ex manager cecil michael feast ex wife mandy toni collette reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade and finally ex partner wild journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality when he opens up his first slade record he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene finally resulting in leading a boring job in america haynes demonstrates that he s quite the visual auteur molding scenes that are like long heald breaths such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover baby s on fire with scenes from a decadent drug party and the film s most wow inspiring sequence the first concert scene of wild with his band the ratttz where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy esuqe movements including stripping naked and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent and another slade discovers his idle even the brief music videos spoofs of bowie s have a rare visual flair that s pure camp and which would cause ken russell to drool the best sequence though may be the beginning following the prelude a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post movement era in it stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet with brian eno s famous needle in the camel s eye playing in the background the scene has a detached exhileration the song doesn t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are it has a distance that s hard to put a finger on and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair depressingly staring into the mirror it comes off as a none too obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film this movie s not so much about plot but more about the way it is presented making this one of those films which is classified as being style over substance a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack however for the most part the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world by using his sets costumes cinematography and especially the music to play as characters in his film the music is especially notable the soundtrack which is wall to wall consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno t rex and roxy music as well as covers by slade s band with vocals by thom yorke and occasionally rhys meyers himself and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie like the cast is rather impressive but no one really walks away with the film and no performances are extremely good although eddie izzard as slade s manager who challenges slade s first manager to an arm wrestling match to see who gets control of his career and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly and collette and mcgregor have their moments rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub par neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes rhys meyers brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era dying when he turned into a retro garbo resorting to a life of salinger ism and found in the mid s to be lying around sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl in fact no one in this film is really seen as a person rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era bale s character is an especially tough sell bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood he s not an extremely personal character and his cliched experiences being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a poof never help us communicate with him nevertheless rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them and others bitter part of which helps the film work since this is a major piece of eye candy at the prime of the movie they at least look the role of fashionable leaders slade with his perpetually changing androgonys persona and wild with his topless and unpredictable image which clash and fuse into an unstable union their story of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who cares attitude crossed with camp is engaging without the personal background the story of stuart though is a tougher sell because he s the everyman and when you can t totally identify with the everyman your story s in slight trouble as a cultural rock piece velvet goldmine is rather good but it is merely good it never totally takes off although it has moments where it absolutely flies but then comes back down it s really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments surrounded by material that could really be much better the beginning is captivating but slow the middle is fantastic and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that it drags the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion it could probably stop at any point and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past which is commendable but not totally so still it does what the oliver stone pic the doors didn t do right becoming very insightful to what happened using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half assed i suppose the message is live life but after you ve lived it what else is the point when you ll be forced to live with regretful memories the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down 
in brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept the audience isn t stupid from that they went on and created the most plot driven intricately pieced movie in the last years the result the usual suspects one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist the story is convoluted and is really confusing to read although easy to follow on screen special investigator kujan chazz palminteri grills verbal kint kevin spacey a crippled con man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than victims kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis the rogue cop keaton gabriel byrne is actually dead kint relates the majority of the film in flashback beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police station lineup in new york city along with dour keaton kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus stephen baldwin mordantly sarcastic hockney kevin pollak and fenster benicio del toro whose speech is virtually incomprehensible together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from new york s finest taxi service crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins what follows is a shell game of violence and betrayal all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze the film is brilliantly compact its the shortest minutes you ll ever spend in a movie theater the cast is exceptional palminteri shines he is brutally honest a true cop one who is going after the whole story because its there byrne is terrific his brooding character his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro who is a riot as fenster del toro is brilliant his lines are a jumbled mess you can t understand a word the man says but it sure is damn funny baldwin is also very good he is careful methodical and cold a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot blooded sarcasm pollak is also terrific as usual a very good character actor however this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey spacey is simply breathtaking he is a force on screen giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze spacey s performance will be remembered for years for it is the best of his career it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last years verbal kint is a clever storyteller weak oppressed and gleefully evil to the bone yet pitiful one who draws sympathy the film is a good one a decent film until the last minutes what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history for me at least the revelation of keyser soze the closing gunfights it is something wondrous you have to see this movie about times to believe what they do kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful fast paced furiously plot driven movie with quirky characters phenomenal acting and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb without furnishing too many details he concocts his story and lets it run hoping the audience gets it at the end we do this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created kudos also to singer and john ottman who created the score they both create what is a true film noir setting carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final jarring ending there are flaws more questions raised than answers lack of character development and no strong female characters save one however the plot and that stunning ending make up for all the flaws and more if you haven t seen the movie rent it watch it then rewind the tape and watch it again trust me you ll be amazed 
perhaps it s time for me to say a little about my reading habits i really do like to read and i ve enjoyed many books in my lifetime my problem is that i m a slow reader and not very dedicated i ll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time it s taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina even though i m loving the book in addition to this i typically don t read anything created after the th century the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting time after time that i haven t read any of the books on which these films are based the only exception i believe is great expectations however i don t think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film needless to say i haven t read the elmore leonard novel out of sight on which steven soderbergh s new film is based i can t say how faithful of an adaptation it is or if it lives up to leonard s vision i can say that it s a terrific film with sharp acting great dialogue and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh it s certainly a nice distraction from s lineup of brainless blockbusters all hopelessly wishing that size mattered out of sight proves that it doesn t i had originally written george clooney off as a one note actor incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair after seeing his latest performance in this film i ve changed my mind this guy can act but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those million superstars here he plays jack foley a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living he does it because it s fun i think but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won t start he goes to jail which is interesting only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend buddy ving rhames we re then introduced to karen sisco jennifer lopez a u s marshall who conveniently is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes fortunately they take her hostage and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence and since this is a gritty crime comedy flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise at first i kind of felt that it was a gimmick but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction too it s a fun gimmick though and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally i ve only seen a few of soderbergh s films i was impressed both with kafka and sex lies and videotape but i think he s excellent at what he does he s an artist without making it obvious and without being pretentious which is always admirable he uses tricks yes lots of freeze frame stuff here but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film as i said clooney is terrific and he s matched by lopez lopez is of course beautiful but she can act too i can sense that she s honing in on her skills for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u turn the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another the best scene in the film by far is the seduction scene the brilliance of this scene is also due in part to soderbergh for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances layered upon light dialogue and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema meaningful and engrossing the supporting cast is strong led by the always reliable ving rhames dennis farina who plays karen s father is good as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain steve zahn who plays jack s nearly brain dead accomplice glenn steals all of his scenes and that s in a film where every scene is already at a high level all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently constructed script by scott frank out of sight is certainly a light film although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory overall i can recommend it simply as great entertainment not every film has to change your life and it s nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers as for the book this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at 
after watching rat race last week i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that when not laughing aloud i had held a grin for virtually all of the film s minutes saturday night i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn t enjoy it as much the second time as the first rat race is a great goofy delight a dandy mix of energetic performances inspired sight gags and flat out silliness hands down this is the most fun film of the summer the movie begins with zippy retro style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a s slapstick comedy featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky jerky bodies bounding around the screen then comes the setup donald sinclair john cleese the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients to that end he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines gathering together the lucky token holders he explains today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six the competition is simple each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city n m containing million in cash there is a transmitter in every key so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead the race has no rules whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes let s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers decked out in flashy trashy clothing and sporting big hair vera baker whoopi goldberg is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby she finds that grown up merrill lanai chapman is erudite conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life thrown together it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature owen templeton cuba gooding jr is currently the most hated man in america an nfl referee he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high profile game after escaping from a vengeful cab driver owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention mr pollini rowan atkinson is a cheerful odd little italian man on holiday in america he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times pollini hitches a ride with zack wayne knight a hyper tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation randy pear jon lovitz promised his wife beverly kathy najimy and two kids a fun filled vacation in las vegas fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview beverly insists the family stay together so they hop in the mini van and tear off into the desert brothers duane seth green and blaine vince vieluf cody are young crooked and stupid blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self done tongue piercing and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal finally nick shaffer breckin meyer is a no nonsense lawyer in training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet amy smart for the journey at first glance they seem blandly wholesome but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn dean cain and spies him swimming with another woman director jerry zucker airplane ghost leaps from racer to racer periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr grisham dave thomas his personality impaired right hand man continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers as with any zucker production a few jokes fall flat but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay off had i been part of the filmmaking team i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm inducing hint of child molestation i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence my god do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing all star but enough carping rat race is a riot with terrific no holds barred performances from the diverse cast see it see it again and when the dvd comes out buy it because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned the teaser trailers for my best friend s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope it looked like the sort of goofy light hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight but little more i d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend s wedding was such a success a strong bouyant romantic comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects featuring a triumphant performance from ms roberts the heroine of my best friend s wedding is julianne potter julia roberts a successful new york restaurant critic and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes rupert everett that years ago she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex lover michael o neal dermot mulroney a sports writer that if they both hadn t married by the time they reached they had promised to marry each other both julianne and michael are both single of course and when george inquires about michael s age julianne realizes that he s mere weeks away from his th birthday and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day however she finds herself even more distraught when michael s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace cameron diaz and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary the setup for my best friend s wedding then is a fairly conventional one and in many ways the film s storyline is formulaic but only to a certain extent the film was directed by p j hogan whose first feature muriel s wedding had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly duckling story and the same holds true for my best friend s wedding which confidently combines traditional romantic comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr hogan for example there s a heartfelt emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film with a trio of teenagers inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks harmonizing in the background my best friend s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen s everyone says i love you i d even assert it s a more successful one my best friend s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well in a typical romantic comedy kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty conniving ice queen and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps this film is smarter than that here kimmy is sweet sincere and innocent julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy s life she d actually like her too the george character is almost a staple of recent film the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason but in my best friend s wedding he gets to have a playful mischievous and charming personality throughout the film the formulaisms one often sees is romantic comedy are given little twists and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion there is a lot of smart writing in the well paced screenplay by ronald bass we re given four interesting vivid and likeable characters with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments my best friend s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts who turns in a top notch confident and reassured performance as julianne this isn t the sort of role one usually associates with ms roberts the julianne character s neurotic fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role but ms roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience if not entirely sympathetic even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable even better than ms roberts though is cameron diaz who turns in a shining performance in my best friend s weddding with a smile which lights up the screen she effectively conveys kimmy s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner and never hits a false note in the film she even sings i won t soon forget her charming serenade of i just don t know what to do with myself rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film his george is a bit of a devilish rogue entirely affable and mr everett s performance is a delight to watch he s clearly having fun and his joy is infectuous dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role unlike the other characters in the film he s not given a lot to do but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms roberts and mr mulroney and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic when julia roberts lustre began to fade and she was usurped from her title as america s sweetheart by sandra bullock i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile while that didn t quite work out it s near certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in the romantic comedy will once again raise her ante in the

a couple of months ago when i first downloaded the face off trailer from the net my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold yawn followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss poor trailer then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u s unique excellent must see well i thought still skeptical i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here here of course was still three months away i ll admit when i trotted off to see this film the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow i d heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled but his films were definitely not on my must see list that let me tell you has changed completely i knew this fact only five minutes into the film after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick seriously i ve never been a big john travolta fan but he like cage perfectly suited his role in the movie sorry make that roles in the movie even travolta s great performance however paled in comparison to cage s character portrayals my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler s hideout half drugged out of his mind he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son s death from castor s perspective doesn t it just break your heart he mutters coldly now don t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie it s not that s what really makes this movie unique it s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters not a common mix at all suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though that s the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around rounds at each other and never hit several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press rewind and watch it over again the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double sided mirror is just plain brilliant whilst cage s and travolta s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies the lesser characters are just as intriguing joan allen who usually sticks to the straight drama movies plays her part perfectly as archer s long suffering wife i like the fact that her character didn t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie it would have wrecked her potrayal gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy s mistreated girlfriend make that one of castor troy s mistreated girlfriends other movies would have used her character as just window dressing a sex object but instead her character is very strong and independent dominique swain who plays archer s daughter also does a nice job though her character is not as explored as much as allen s or gershon s faults well there were some i have to say first the movie s ending whilst being very good overall was a bit too drawn out for it s own good after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can t help but think geez are you guys nuclear powered or what there were certain bits that weren t handled properly like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform prison more explanation here would have been nice overall this movie was not perfect but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made i certainly hope so 
robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible god given gifts but are able to act like ordinary people in the natural he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined to be the best there ever was but still acted like a humble farm boy in butch cassidy and the sundance kid he was the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good looking charmer even in indecent proposal where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting a tale of lost love in his latest film the horse whisperer based on the best selling novel by nicholas evans redford again plays such a character redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie i suppose the character of tom booker a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses was just too good to pass up despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses a magazine article coins the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life booker s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas a new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson was recently in a horrible accident the accident which is filmed with gut wrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses an eighteen wheeler kills grace s friend severely wounds and traumatizes grace s horse pilgrim and causes grace to lose part of her right leg annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed as well which leads her to booker at first she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that doesn t work instead she packs up grace and pilgrim leaves her husband robert sam neill behind and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sister in law diane dianne wiest in many ways the film is like a journey both literally and symbolically the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal and it s hard not to see annie and grace s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs country in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide open spaces of montana that grace s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate annie s controlling nature begins to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed a river runs through it six years ago in many ways the horse whisperer comes from the same poetic vein as river and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera time on the grass and mountains but then that would ruin the magic much of the film s photography is truly elegant and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land to further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killers platoon cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film which takes place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filters and a more squarish aspect ratio when the action shifts to montana richardson switches to soft focus and natural lighting and the screen widens to a aspect ratio in terms of the story itself the horse whisperer gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean s a brief encounter and clint eastwood s adaptation of robert james waller s the bridges of madison county richard lagravenese co screenwriter here also adapted bridges although the horse whisperer has a strong romantic sensibility i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who s being left behind for this brief heart sweeping affair but there rarely is in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddy duddy husband falls to sam neill he plays the character as a decent hard working man who is a good husband and father his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be a normal fairly uninspiring man there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out of place in a baseball cap as they enter the pen booker assuredly swings over the fence while robert hesitates then opens the gate and in a goofy moment forgets to close it behind him it s a small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movie s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it the best scenes in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse although booker s horse training methods are mythical and unrealistic the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true at some point i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nevertheless redford is obviously a romantic at heart and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film there are no dramatic sex scenes but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow dancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moments like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission

tempe mills cinema az this movie had us in non stop stitches from beginning to end all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie if you thought they were funny see the rest of the movie it s hilarious how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head bopping on snl to exactly one song easy write an interesting script around tried and true ideas add some good lines and satire and voil you end up with an excellent well done very entertaining flick will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day at night they pursue their life long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills ca the only disco act worth going to the only problem the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door the roxbury closes all the while bearing witness to guys with one hundred dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss the script authors steve koren will ferrell and chris kattan cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury their flower shop van is rear ended by richard grieco who fears a law suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star struck to think about the car accident they just had but not about getting into the roxbury grieco happily takes them in even introduces them to the owner which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers elisa donovan and gigi rice who bet their time and bodies on will and chris what follows are some of the best slap stick dancing routines ever the music is superb and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez s born to be alive the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by for example the bee gees and their stayin alive it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will and chris don t have any mone y and dump both on the spot even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away an art imitates life poke at shallow women it s a scene that s an approximate parody of the vinegar s own rolf luedeke s editorial this week national organization for men nom replaces now ted unabomber kaczynski himself rejected for not having money will identify well with this scene if he ever watches the movie of course the script wouldn t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good looking disco blondes proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby nevertheless will s father wants him to marry molly anyway but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest quarter exile during the wedding ceremony will s heart isn t exactly into getting married and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head bopping music will thinks worse of the knot tieing idea and runs to chris definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony i found this scene a riot however it went over brandi s head she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries instead the step in buddy weight lifter who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy and who has been lusting for a good looker for a long time but ready now to take anyone more art imitates life stuff not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world the idiots mother is played by loni anderson whose barbie doll looks don t play well anymore she s a bit old and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in need of a lot of laughs go with a date brandi laughed non stop as i did and a deaf mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for minutes 
fritz lang s first american film since leaving nazi germany is an eye opener about a lynch mob in a small town joe wilson spencer tracy is a regular joe a hard working stiff a decent guy who is living with his two brothers tom walcott and charlie albertson in chicago he is engaged to katherine grant sylvia sidney but can t save up enough money to marry her she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher before she departs she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother sews up his ripped trench coat corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento and kisses him goodbye a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her he arrives at a near by town called strand but the deputy sheriff buggs meyers walter brennan comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl the sheriff ellis finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money and he fits the general description of the suspect locked in jail he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence in the local bar the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect a mob storms the jail burns it down and dynamites it when they can t get through to the prisoner s jail cell the sheriff called the governor for the national guard but one of his political advisers countermanded that request saying it wouldn t look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him somehow joe escapes but his dog rainbow dies katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell and becomes convinced that he died the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers who are startled to see him alive that he wants revenge he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the leaders in the lynch mob an ambitious district attorney walter abel prosecutes the for murder katherine not knowing he s alive remains in a state of shock but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death the defense claims that it can t be a charge of murder without a corpse the trial proves to be interesting as the citizens in this close knit respectable community lie under oath providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn t have been at the jail the sheriff also lies saying he can t identify anyone in the mob but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film as for proof of the corpse an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe in the note memento is misspelled which makes katherine realize that joe is alive when the sentence is announced of the accused are found guilty of murder but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened katherine forgives him and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have but don t blame lang for all the changes in the film of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive mgm couldn t bear to have it made the way lang wanted it that is by having tracy die in the lynching instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script to lang s credit even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised you couldn t help get the feeling that the citizens didn t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their vigilantes from going to jail even perjuring themselves their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren t going to be convicted lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed and the innocent jovial good guy seen in the beginning of the film has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience 
maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it s not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker broadcasted on abc on a monday night starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth respectively because it s not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it s so great underneath the to die for cinematography the brilliant acting and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it tell it in a certain original way it doesn t merely go from plot point to plot point it goes from character to character it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all and makes the story of a world reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters both musicians who have a totally unique relationship it s that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this unlike patch adams effortlessly emotional and real in short this movie is just awesome it merely tells its story really well and that s something that just has to be commended these days when most stories are botched because they re not told by great storytellers director anand tucker tells this story well he overdramaticizes everything but still keeps it real the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr rachel griffiths and emily watson respectively two sisters who are first seen in childhood played by auriol evans and keely flanders respectively as the very best of friends they are also both musicians hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist and when it all begins both are considered child prodigies but hilary is seen as the better of the two jackie a bit jealous works and works at her playing skills and soon the tables are turned when they both hit adulthood hilary strives for a comeback while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world but instead of fame captures the heart of a hapless joyful conductor kiffer finzi david morissey in a semi star making turn they marry after a short courtship and move to a lovely country house making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life when she plays she has the eyes of the world but when she stops she s alone she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist daniel barenboim james frain in hopes that she may overcloud her sister but she eventually begins to lose it and runs away to hilary s country home where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure it s all terribly melodramtic as you can see and by the time jackie has contracted ms in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi smiliar shine in technical and emotional devastation it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn t been handled in such a way the key thing here is that it s not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it s about her tumultuous relationship with her sister which i might add is perfectly realized their relationship is the most down to earth complex entity of the year they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world but they re also completely jealous of one another when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities she tries in vain to make a comeback but can t and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i ve ever seen in a film only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man and the whole time their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested another thing i really liked is emily watson s performance i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease or any combination of the three my reasoning for this is that it s a fucking easy job the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in beloved sure she s good but what s so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around slurs her words together and acts like a three year old inside a year old s body hell i could play that if i had a pair of breasts in that same exact movie though is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane her brothers run off never to be seen again and her mother s lover is scared off she has to actually deal with real emotions something much harder than mere stumbling about but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons if you don t believe me look at jack nicholson s performance in as good as it gets great performance but easy job this isn t so for watson though because her insanity comes from real emotions not just a plot point and thanks to the opening sequence where we see her and hilary as kids we understand the motives behind all her actions and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life we ve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses rachel griffiths who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson s protagonist actually matches watson step for step because as watson grows insane and demands unspeakable things from her griffiths holds her own and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her griffiths an otherwise unknown actress and watson being famous from breaking the waves and the boxer is absolutely brilliant just as absolutely brilliant as watson is and if the academy and all the other critics groups who ve already deemed watson s performance the best of the year glance over hers because she s the one who doesn t get to go insane read she gets the boring role then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me after all griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real the tom cruise role in rainman the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman she does and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year it s griffiths together the two actresses work extremely well though and both have to go through deep emotional hell the likes of which haven t been seen this year if it hadn t been for an otherwise not totally great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety i d say this is one of the top ten best films of the year it s so close to perfection in its structure its treatment of its subject and its beautiful technical specifications cinematography nomination without a shred of doubt in my mind and maybe film editing that it s nearly a shame that it s not the flawless gem that it should be but hey as it is i can hardly complain 
the full monty is a whole lot of fun its wacky witty and original it s written and directed by relatively unknowns simon beaufoy and peter cattaneo who both turned up oscar nominations how did this movie with a budget under million gross over million worldwide its been rumored that this film may be the second most profitable movie of the year and to think its about male exotic dancers and not sinking ships six steel workers who have been recently been laid off and are all looking for jobs inspired by the success of a chippendale s production gaz robert carlyle decides they should all put on a strip show to make some money quickly as the six team up to put on the show of their lives they run into a few problems for instance dave mark addy is worried about his weight horse paul barber thinks he may be inadequate and gerald tom wilkinson is worried about his reputation and timing so when the night of the show comes will the men be able to do the full monty as i said before this is a fun movie and not just that its really artistically good the writing and direction are great the acting is appealing all the performances have a human quality to them so you can relate to at least one of the characters the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture which left me wondering one thing why didn t trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year while the full monty is a great lighthearted comedy it doesn t carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting still the full monty is a great film a must see 
it has happened again a movie that is well scripted well acted and well directed it is involving suspenseful it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie the sixth sense is that movie starring bruce willis armageddon as a child psychologist and haley joel osment forrest gump as a troubled youngster the sixth sense is more spooky than scary though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle eight year old cole sear osment sees dead people not just in dreams and not just as lifeless bodies he sees them walking around like regular people and he sees them all the time dr malcolm crowe willis is trying to help him he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest but first he needs to gain cole s trust the boy is so frightened by what he sees he has closed himself off emotionally being unwilling to tell anyone not crowe not even his own mother toni collette clockwatchers about his secrets crowe begins to spend more and more time with him even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him his wife anna olivia williams rushmore becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy bruce willis underplays his role allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won t communicate to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations to wondering if perhaps there isn t some truth behind what the boy sees mr willis does a serviceable job letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona eleven year old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance he demonstrates an amazing amount of self composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro it is fine work for one of such a tender age keep your eye on this young man the supporting cast is also quite effective toni collette as the confused frightened and frustrated mother who can t understand what is happening to her child olivia williams as crowe s once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband and donnie wahlberg ransom as crowe s ex patient now grown who illustrates his doctor s failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable twenty eight year old m night shyamalan wide awake directed his own script maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film s full impact is not reached until its final moments when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr shyamalan as the one responsible is certainly to be commended in giving the sixth sense a favorable three star review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit i must also point out that spiritually speaking the film is highly misleading there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the living dead the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve thou shall not surely die a direct contradiction of god s admonition that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ an event which has not yet occurred therefore the dead remain in a state of oblivion having no consciousness until that long awaited time when the final trump shall sound and then you ll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens 
this dumb cowboy blondie who thinks he is a darn good loverboy decides to leave his dusty ol town somewhere in texas and go to new york he puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach when he arrives to new york he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best darn stud in the whol o new york city obviously he fails he meets the cripple rico dustin hoffman who is terrifically good in a bar rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down so he walks in a peculiar way rico is a thief and wants to get some money off this rich dumb cowboy he cheats our cowboy out of through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears soon our cowboy runs out of money he gets kicked out of his hotel and starts getting hungry walking through the city with everybody s talkin playing in the background oh and his prided techno transistor radio in hand he spots rico in a cafe rico half scared pours out all the money in his pocket filthy cents our cowboy hungry is forgiving he is glad he found someone he knows rico offers to make it up for him and he invites him to his place and what a filthy cold place it is our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the junk bed when he finally wakes jumps up he finds rico looking at him you wanna cup a coffee rico asks in his friendly sleazy somewhat childish manner while he smokes on a ciggy what re you a goddamn faggot what do you want from me where are my shoes what did you do to them but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded rico really has a heart together they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees but he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida we will soon be in miami is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking moving end of a film it is the classic theme music midnight cowboy helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable 
it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive so delicate so insightful and yes even so enjoyable somehow the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through set in the s the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells tobey maguire ride with the devil an orphan twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr wilbur larch michael caine little voice father figure to the orphans of st cloud obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage he might as well be of use dr larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics soon homer is delivering babies like a professional he refuses to perform abortions instead wondering why the couples just didn t behave more responsibly larch too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals marvels that homer continues to have such high expectations of people such is the result of an insulated upbringing though skilled in certain medical procedures homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world he must go out into it befriending a young couple who had come to see dr larch he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived thus homer begins his worldly instruction with new friend candy kendall charlize theron the astronaut s wife a willing tutor tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life s questions many of which he was unaware needed to be asked he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing michael caine is in a word brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans many of whom he helped to bring into the world calling them princes of maine kings of new england in his ritualistic goodnight mr caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine delroy lindo a life less ordinary has many powerful moments as mr rose the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins director lasse hallstrom what s eating gilbert grape and screenwriter novelist john irving the world according to garp who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter regardless of one s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers figuring the rules didn t apply to them since they didn t have a hand in writing them they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along dr larch in his own way acts similarly there is a danger in that line of reasoning god has also given us a set of rules unlike the list posted in the cider house god s rules if followed promise us benefits beyond our imagination and yet many continue to ignore his rules preferring to make up their own as they go through life trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding proverbs kjv just as a builder follows a designer s blueprint or a conductor follows a composer s score why shouldn t we follow the rules of life given to us by life s architect for our own blessing 
i m an avid fan of the alien saga so this review is obviously a tad biased at least i admitted it of course that doesn t mean that i m gonna be giving this a four star review or something because alien resurrection the fourth film in the cool as hell series is not an absolutely amazing film much like the first two were however it s a very good film which never fails to entertain and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series in short i had a good time alien resurrection leaves off years after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genre s answer to job had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one of course the last one wasn t very great or anything i liked it though not as much as the first two and more importantly it wasn t financially successful a tawdry million bucks so back we are with ripley back as a clone which means we get another little satirical look at cloning not that that s a bad thing but it s becoming a cliche so she s cloned aboard an even more futuristic looking ship called the auriga by some doctors including the necessary bad government guy dr wren played by j e freeman as well as the little seen dr gediman played by none other than brad douriff mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her once you get past the fact that you can t figure out where they got her blood although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one the film s okay also on board are a band of mercenary pirates including michael wincott ron perlman kim flowers raymond cruz dominique pinon a jeunet sytable and winona ryder who plays analee call who turns out to have a bit of a secret i won t state it but unless you ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years you probably know all about it although it s nicely covered up there s a bit of a non sexual yet slightly homoerotic relationship between her and ripley but it s never really deepened enough oh well well as you might have guessed the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship including some shocks dan hedaya for instance who s death is comical yet sad since well he s dan hedaya and the remaining people about or are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth of course the plot is all balderdash and just an excuse for some good old alien brand fun the real focus of the series seems to be on style not really substance although there s always a bit of it most notably in aliens with the relationship between ripley and the little girl what s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach alien is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights aliens is a wild tense thriller alien is a bleak moody piece of semi noir alien is kind of like an off beat french film filled with lots of humor and cool scares jean pierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like das boot has with echoes hinting at a possible threat the chills in the film are really cool especially with the music which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes there s the most tense surgery scene since face off towards the beginning and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed one is the aforementioned surgery scene another one takes place between call and ripley which is just awesome the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense thrilling and jaw dropping scenes in the entire saga with a small allusion to jeunet s earlier film delicatessen and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool with a lovely allusion to goldfinger but the best scene in the entire film i m sure i m not the first to mention it takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her she has a an tatooed on her arm it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work as it never really deapens a lot of the characters however it does make us care about most of them so that when there s very little of them and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow we are pretty scared and yeah there are some very funny lines ripley who do i have to fuck to get off this boat johner well i can get you off but not this ship the acting is good all around with stand out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad in se en who performed the lust sin as an anxiety ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him winona ryder is good but not amazing like she usually is although she meshes well with the film of course and as usual sigourney weaver steals the show playing a variation on the ripley character less emotional and more rude and bitter she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable she s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for aliens but she s just awesome overall it s a thrilling entertaining film which doesn t really amaze like the first two but is much more amazing than the third installment the style is the best part of the film which isn t really a bad thing but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply but it s entertaining as hell and it s definitely fit for the alien series 
trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the s then cut to the harsh reality of the present sheffield has become some sort of a semi slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel factories a once flourishing industry gaz carlyle spends most of his time in the worker s club a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers he and his plump friend dave addy as well as their former foreman gerald wilkinson have been sitting around the club for months without any call for duty what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the pounds of child support money to his ex wife suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild idea to get the money he desperately requires dave and gerald too have problems of their own on top of his lack of employment dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his plump appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as months leaving home for work when he was actually a long standing member of the worker s club there we have it people with real problems and a not so practical solution for them gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag to perform a strip act at the local pub in gaz s own words while looking at an add for a strip act featuring hunky beautiful men if women are willing to pay for this they sure as well will pay for real men the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all it is a small film which delves in the harsh reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human factor going for it never for once was it trying to be manipulative at all the full monty was true to itself all the way while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh something lacking in many comedy films wannabes from hollywood other than carlyle who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on screen however the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying carlyle s work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting implying real acting skill and flexibility on screen kudos to the people involved in this film especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just another striptease already a critical and financial success for such a small film the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way the full monty gives one the same satisfaction in half the time 
with many big budget science fiction films great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts cheesy plot twists and terrible acting the fifth element the abyss and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting writing or both at first glance the matrix larry andy wachowski s sci fi kung fu shoot em up spectacular looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high concept bad movies especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue the matrix works it s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films most obviously the terminator films star wars and total recall but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout reeves plays neo a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with trinity carrie anne moss a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks a unseen omniscient cult figure known as morpheus lawrence fishburne and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems moreover he discovers that the grim bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah with grave doubts that he is actually the one prophesized to come and save the world reluctant or not what follows is a mix of hong kong style slow motion shootouts surreal dream sequences high speed chases and comic book kung fu fights the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion unfortunately the matrix doesn t provide many answers to the questions it raises but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions shoot outs and flying roundhouse kicks perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving who plays agent smith the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix weaving s stony appearance deadpan voice and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting evil technological force that controls the matrix like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t terminator in terminator judgement day weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because despite his power and seeming invincibility he looks ordinary even scrawny weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography it seems to be deliberately kitchy with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors in a few scenes the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring however with the comic book style and tone of the film you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience the matrix isn t a classic its open ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero the kind of shmaltzy feel good goo that most of the film avoids reportedly the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel unfortunately audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future the matrix is an fun enjoyable diversion like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival just don t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry 
this film is based on the campy tv show from the s under the same appellation mind you most people including yours truly who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series the movie is really a stand alone in that regard the family robinson lost in space plot set in the year the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future a colonization process if you will they are joined by able pilot west leblanc and evil uninvited stowaway oldman who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip eventually their trek goes awry and all are lost in space how do get back to earth is the question that infests the rest of this sci fi epic critique this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element from the summer of it s a film with a lot of flash but very little actual substance admittedly there isn t an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film but this film does run a little too long and did lose me in regards to its complex time travel multi dimensional story line having said that the special effects in this movie were amazing and the overall look and feel were also way above average you really felt like you were in the future and riding through space with these poor souls unfortunately for this chosen family their year old son is the smartest one in the group and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ever heard that one before yawn the acting is ok and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend s matt leblanc who shows us all that he s definitely more than just a pretty face on the down side the family riff raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time consuming even though we gotta give them credit for trying to develop characters in a sci fi pic the story line is hard to follow the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he s evil and the movie goes on for about minutes too long on the slick side many of the special effects are really cool the sequence in which the family is paralyzed during the hyper drive is awesome and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling i will also admit that somehow they got me to semi tear up near the conclusion of this picture very odd overall if you re a big sci fi fan check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative and if you re not i would still suggest seeing this movie but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts little known facts this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic out of the top spot at the box office after straight weeks at number one garry oldman is british and was once married to uma thurman for about six months mimi rogers was tom cruise s first wife 
the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients a witty and whimsical script inspired performances a great sense of humor a large and wonderful cast and the beautiful scenery of vancouver it s a movie of weddings marriage family infidelity and oh yes love like men and a baby cousins is an americanized version of a french film s cousin cousine the plot is complicated but it goes something like this larry and tom are cousins each of whom is not so happily married tom starts an affair with larry s wife tish and to get even larry and tom s wife maria pretend to have an affair of their own soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role and virtually every performance deserves mention ted danson in his first starring film role finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on cheers he is also complex and vulnerable with more between his ears than empty space as maria isabella rossellini is a joy to watch she is shy sensuous and immensely alluring sean young is perfectly cast as larry s picture perfect wife tish a superficial and trendy make up consultant keith coogan from adventures in babysitting is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larry s rebellious son mitch and finally lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitch s rambunctious grandfather he provides some of cousins best lines and laughs like moonstruck cousins is a mix of drama and comedy the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart tug how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other as friends and as lovers well to its credit cousins is just such a movie let s hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins 
when i saw the trailer for the sixth sense i didn t expect much from it my snap judgment was that it was a watered down version of the shining or possibly a late entry in the glut of angel related movies tv shows of a couple years ago but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe at the beginning of the movie he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work but he is soon confronted by vincent a patient malcolm failed years earlier donnie wahlberg former new kid in an impressive cameo a year passes and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed cole sear haley joel osment is a withdrawn kid who is called freak by the other boys in the neighborhood weird things seem to happen around cole his mother olivia williams leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn t moved and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn t for example that there was once a gallows in his school he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom the trailer gave away the movie s first major plot twist if it hadn t the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn t know what s wrong with cole if you re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer stop reading this review right now and go see the sixth sense anyway since the trailer gave it away i figure it s fair game to discuss here once malcolm gains cole s trust cole reveals his secret he sees ghosts everywhere dead people wander around not knowing that they re dead invisible to everyone except cole malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth the box office success of the sixth sense has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that s so i hate to burst anybody s bubble but the sixth sense isn t really a horror film at its core the sixth sense is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally scarred adult help each other to move past their problems some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy though one that really got to me the ghost of a boy says to cole i ll show you where my dad keeps his gun when the ghost turns we see the bullet wound in the back of his head osment gives the best performance i ve ever seen from a child actor it s hard enough to find a grown up in hollywood who can give a subtle realistic portrayal although willis gets top billing cole is really the protagonist of the story and osment truly brings the complex kid to life if only willis work were as impressive accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm his most challenging role to date this is a bad omen for his next movie the story of us which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage writer director m night shyamalan has a light poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite he s also a skillful storyteller as the movie s ending demonstrates only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole bottom line osment should get an oscar nomination and you should go see this movie 
scarface a remake of the film of the same name is a very gripping and as far as i know a true to life story of how power and violence lead to corruption al pacino as tony montana for whom the movie is named also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states many of these cubans had criminal records such as tony montana a cocky fast talking man who has the look of crime nearly right after his arrival in miami tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry along with his friend and partner manolo steven bauer tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez robert loggia a high roller in the organized crime field tony also begins to fall in love with elvira michelle pfeiffer who at the time was frank s lover of course sooner or later in this industry betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force this is not before he becomes one of the most respected and often feared men in miami tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him no one can trust him and basically no one does scarface although incredibly violent is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance it truly is a very good one in fact his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination although he did get a golden globe nomination another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity a figure tagged to the film boasts that the word fuck and it s uses are uttered times throughout the film which is apparently a record the thing is the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie as odd as it sounds it s true in the end scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard 
up until about a year ago john travolta s career consisted of those look who s talking movies notice how they never called them look who s talented and the bomb shout which was bad enough to make most people scream but somewhere along the line travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in would experience fame and fortune once again while barry robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a straight to the cutout bin album aptly named size isn t everything and of course they learned that sales are everything but now travolta s back on the hollywood scene once again and i think we all know why four words contract with the devil and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich s contract with america no satan is much more humane anyway yes travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld how do i know i own the document in question amazing what you can buy at those collector s shops for a few hundred dollars isn t it get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction with travolta as crime minion chili palmer he goes to collect some of the mafia s money from a b grade director gene hackman and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game sure a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood but i guess that s beside the point palmer is determined to get hackman s next project made so he sets out to convince big star martin weir danny devito to star in the movie bringing along down and out horror actress karen flores rene russo who has already had affairs with hackman and devito it doesn t take a las vegas odds maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well after the customary sexual tension and denial which has been used in every comedy from who s the boss to speechless it works in this case unlike who s the boss although it s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman s other films and want in on this one too along with travolta s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction despite the obvious similarities this movie doesn t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i ve seen this year yes even better than halloween vi get shorty is my kind of movie one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence i m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on are you getting this shorty 
the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man s life especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances thematically in cinema love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters it is rare however for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni s neo classic drama life is beautiful through a central cast of father mother and son benigni demonstrates the wonderful undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times life is beautiful for guido orefice roberto benigni directing himself here for the sixth time in his career an italian jew master con man and aspiring waiter extraordinaire living in s italy he lives a carefree life of good fortune it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora nicoletta braschi although dora is already engaged guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead the two have a child named joshua giorgio cantarini unfortunately for the happy family the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie s theme of family love becomes the strongest although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm he relaxes the role to ensure his son s happiness now instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right benigni s performance is truly a well rounded one and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year the supports are all strong as well but the movie truly excels in its script life is beautiful is a self proclaimed fable one which tells its story in grand two part fashion in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a saturday night live spinoff a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot but in the movie s second half the script s circular nature becomes admirably obvious characters make reprise appearances in fine form and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot s outcome in all fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture and novice movie watchers may take this opportunity to see their first artsy film life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone and above all is a fine thematic picture 
perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects there is no question that action adventure and science fiction action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years such as raiders of the lost ark were made in grand traditional fashion contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion dollar creations of computer technology the latest in this visually awesome series of movies the wachowski brothers the matrix is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie s story unlike many sci fi movies which promote themselves as effects heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event it runs minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film s length contrary to popular trend the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound in this regard the movie is something like a card sharp with its flashy mass stripped away the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented the script is characteristically weak and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach but like the card sharp the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent the viewers don t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner and right around the corner they usually are for the script tells a fast paced albeit frequently revisited story as the movie explains the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence the matrix farms our life energy only a select group of individuals knows of the real world and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra cool morpheus laurence fishburne morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo keanu reeves believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion the set design is very dynamic running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy the costumes as well as the actors who wear them add to the roles for instance the manifested antagonists in the movie a group of agents created by the matrix in its computer program all dress in matching secret servicewear the rebel fighters on the other hand dress in rich hues of leather the casting cannot be criticized for the typically stoic reeves isn t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool supports in carrie anne moss joe pantoliano and hugo weaving are all effectual one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year s science fiction masterpiece dark city particularly if one ponders how this same premise would ve worked from a different approach the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear here the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise the better picture between the two depends on the viewer but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun 
i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate cuba s oscar nominee for best foreign film directed by tomas gutierrez alea who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo memories of underdevelopment i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late s it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition i knew then that memorias was probably a state sanctioned political missive and now expect strawberry will follow suit fellow internetters primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba soc culture cuba have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line it probably looks like political criticism but it ain t so having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro s repressiveness i can t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution and i can t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement as kids say these days duh the revolution s current state needs no criticism its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident the proper questions to put relate to castro s legitimacy i bet the film takes castro s power for granted and that this or any other movie produced under cuba s state control cannot question his right to run cuba s political show ongoing now for more than years that s why i just can t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime let s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up i saw the film twice i was right castro remained intact strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young dialectic materialist as he describes himself and a homosexual photographer diego in cuba the young man david is the son of peasants a symbol of the revolution s reason for being grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education he studies political science instead of literature his avocation because he perceives it is his duty therein lies a likely unintended irony since cuba has no need for political theoreticians cuba s government is castro diego s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life he enjoys the finer things tea opera art he does not do voluntary work for the revolution his small apartment is a sensual oasis the moniker bourgeois figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie however he is a revolucionario in his own way the supporting roles are filled by an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche david s roommate who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme david s ex girlfriend who dumped him for another guy yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband german a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit and who strikes a faustian pact with the government gutierrez alea and co director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too heck towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor he really loves the revolution as supposedly does everybody else in cuba and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws real criticism is missing though this movie is political window dressing luis aguilar leon s op ed piece on fresa in the miami herald march at a did not color my judgment it presaged my intuition aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film s political angle best like many artistic manifestations in cuba strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point although terrible propaganda this is otherwise a fine film 
niagara niagara r bob gosse s niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young lovers on the road movies wild marcy robin tunney and calm seth henry thomas meet cute literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store a mere couple of scenes later the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants along the way true love inevitably blossoms what sets niagara niagara apart though is that marcy is afflicted with tourette s syndrome a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics tunney displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year s venice film festival to term her work a tour de force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery tunney s effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability which makes her depiction of marcy s illness which often causes her to act violently that much more convincing and tragic she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off kilter chemistry their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss a detour involving a kindly widower michael parks who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt and the key character of a trigger happy pharmacist stephen lang is highly unbelievable but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney s bravura turn which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved opens march i didn t know what to expect it s like something you chase for so long but then you don t know how to react when you get it i still don t know how to react michael jordan on winning his first nba championship in or my thoughts after meeting him on november 
so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton but they just don t get the good grades so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide the remaining roommates will get an automatic chris michael vartan and tim matthew lillard are two guys who really want the to get into harvard how far will they go to get their chris and tim are also roommates with rand played by randall batinkoff the two scheme to murder rand make it look like a suicide so they can supposedly get their they have heard this rumor many places and they are willing to take the chance to find out rand is a very very mean person he treats his girlfriend natalie played by tamara craig thomas like she doesn t matter at all she is very afraid of him and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant she does tell him and he becomes enraged that night would be the last night of rand s life tim and chris give rand a bottle of rat poison making him think that it is beer rand drinks down the poison and then dies now tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself it does not take long until the suicide note is found but the body isn t found the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information feeling extreme guilt chris is having a very hard time especially with his girlfriend emma played by keri russell she wants to know more but he will not even speak with her will he give in will tim turn chris in will chris turn tim in will they turn themselves in all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film the events in the curve are very surprising original and fun the plot sounds much like dead man on campus but that is not the deal with this film this film is a very serious one with not many laughs there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying it is a terrific suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride the sound really stood out in the film it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film the way the movie is filmed is also great all of the technical aspects as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done the performances in the curve are very good matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role just like in s scream a he is very strange in this film as well i like him in this sort of role rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she s all that michael vartan is fantastic as chris who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed where he co starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student keri russell also gives a great performance she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film tamara craig thomas is also realistic especially coping with the death of her boyfriend some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case the bottom line i might just have to curve that a into an a note the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early it was decided the film would not be released widely it is now available at blockbuster video only and for rent only see you at the video store 
the word rest in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all what does takes place is more based on character development the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people nick beth carol and sid what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield arizona to butte montana and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different carol is nick s ex girlfriend and beth s best friend sid is a joint smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in obviously based on a stage play the problem with the movie is that there s a lot of things left out it s not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other the reason why nick was fired from his job isn t mentioned and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery when he hasn t seen them for many years set in a small fictional town in arizona was a good move since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings the name of the city is not important this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with but i ll keep an eye on her in the future interesting trivia this was rated r in the us but rated barntill ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it 
 note there are spoilers regarding the film s climax the election of course we see matthew broderick a man torn to a primal state he s been unfaithful to his wife lied to and manipulated his students and by the same token they ve demeaned his masculinity his self respect his desperate attempt at changing the world and yet he equates the cause of his pain his torment with tracy flick reese witherspoon no matter how many students have come and gone and disappointed him as an educator she s the real threat about to give in and divulge that she s won by only a lone vote broderick s mccalister turns in defeat sees tracy s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says no the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men no matter how obscure have in their relationships a traditional expectation of success to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry she can t go higher than him he won t allow it and what s amazing about election is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically and then sexually involved with a now departed teacher it s like payne and taylor his co screenwriter have taken tracy a girl desperate for friendship loyalty and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers that they found sitting at the teachers lunch table more fitting to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist and it s amazing the compassion that we have it seems so real to us and not merely because it s happened before splashed all over the front pages but because of the all around nice persona of these people we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters it s with mandy barnett s if you ll be the teacher playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most a final viscous injection of bittersweet irony sexuality though is not the only basis for payne s satire or its success it also makes a telling point about politics friendship and class boundaries satire is required or ought to be anyway to take itself seriously or act so while the audience does not it s a fine line to straddle but some films ignore it altogether drop dead gorgeous leaps infuriatingly to mind payne and taylor hit the right chord their characters are real people neither is perfect but rather both of the leads are flawed misguided individuals who retain somewhat noble intentions at heart we sympathize with them but still as a satire their idiosyncratic behavior and their wrongdoing is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle but also reflect and meditate about minus half a point though for payne admitting not to having seen ferris bueller s day off whatever 
corey yuen s latest film hero is notable on two fronts first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production secondly the film is the re discovery of yuen biao the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai poverty and crime rule most of china a young man ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier tam see is the most powerful gangster in town having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams wing jing s to be a powerful and wealthy man and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love wing jing meets the singer at the club jessica hester and falls in love with her not realizing that she is the star attraction after stealing her picture from a display wing jing and his brother plot to impress her first they rob two foreigner s of their money and cloths and set up a midnight rendezvous unfortunately wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see s night club the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn jessica having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night gives up and returns home see decides to retire he gives the night club to wing jing as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder see arranges the trade and ask his lover valerie chow to take care of wing jing unfortunately she has sided with yeung seung the performances in the film are all top notch with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow the comic turn by yuen wah previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung s eastern condors is a marvelous surprise his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious the stand out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments with a stellar performance his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride his gangster is almost non violent in that he only retaliates never instigates violence but when the time comes to fight yuen biao has never looked better corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late the lighting cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch the action scenes do not disappoint either this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i ve seen in some time actually surpassing jackie chan s work in both rumble in the bronx and first strike the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed also noteworthy is the score for the film done in a marvelously lush orchestral style not representative of most hong kong fare i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both titanic and rosewood as best of the year all in all hero marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing 
one of the best things about my job is that every so often a film still catches me by surprise spy kids certainly did an adventure story aimed primarily at children the movie is smart zippy fun the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable likable kids and their parents are get ready for this intelligent capable and loving bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well staged action scenes avoid excessive violence what a relief it is to be able to review an all ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics consider the other pg rated family friendly movie in theaters now see spot run has a mother going out of town leaving her son with an idiot neighbor body function humor abounds including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process at the hospital the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn t bit off the other one because two metal replacement balls would clack together of course the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells somebody clue me in when did genital mutilation become funny spy kids is a welcome antidote to the repellent see spot run using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness carmen alexa vega and her younger brother juni daryl sabara live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents gregorio antonio banderas and ingrid cortez carla gugino mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children what the kids don t know is that they are also former spies once agents from different countries assigned to erase each other they instead fell in love married and retired to raise a family needless to say they get drawn back to the business shortly into their first joint mission they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop alan cumming a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni s favorite tv show but there is evil behind the scenes as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him back at home uncle felix cheech marin shows up to reveal mom and dad s secret to the kids after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish while a slew of wicked people including teri hatcher chase them during the course of their adventures they get to use jet packs electroshock bubblegum and super computer sunglasses they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop s tv show they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms legs and heads would normally be why are the guards so ineffective because they re all thumbs they move from one colorful locale to another including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from star trek the storyline is silly and convoluted but even at its most dense it is easier to follow than either mission impossible movie director robert rodriguez from dusk to dawn maintains a frenetic pace with the whole film clocking in at a mere minutes a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team squabbling the way kids do but coming together when it counts antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments a virtual cloud backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that i would have enjoyed the film more and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc ubiquitous company regardless spy kids is a hoot offering fun for adults and children alike and just think they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle

 the deep end uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues alluring attractive blues but also icy and foreboding after taking in their beauty the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land the production works that way as well it pulls you in initially as a crisp thoroughly modern thriller with clipped exchanges between defiantly non communicative characters but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as the deep end gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating spoiler alert the following reveals the basic storyline i believe the plot points are incidental because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters but still you should proceed at your own risk with her husband tom a naval officer often away at sea margaret hall tilda swinton holds down the fort taking care of the children beau jonathan tucker paige tamara hope and dylan jordon dorrance while her father in law jack peter donat hovers in the background always watching the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno it seems that beau her eldest is having an affair with darby reese josh lucas a disreputable sort years his senior margaret demands that darby leave her son alone only to have the man smirk at her and announce he ll be glad to steer clear of beau for back at home she tries to talk about it all with her son but the kid won t even confirm that he s gay let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend he does however get attentive when she reveals darby s offer even as he maintains his sullen demeanor late in the evening darby shows up outside tossing pebbles at beau s window like a schoolchild the two meet by the water at the boathouse where something important happens i won t reveal what suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie by the way within a day or so margaret s life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape once margaret coughs up oh what s a mother to do end spoilers written directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel suture the deep end is based on elisabeth sanxay holding s s novel the blank wall which was also the source of the film the reckless moment i ve neither read the book nor seen the movie but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details in holding s story the scandalous relationship is between an older man and margaret s teen age daughter switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary and it also raises questions about margaret s motives many reviews of the deep end describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son but i wonder consider this margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a larger than life figure her father in law is constantly present almost as if he is monitoring for his son and when her husband does call margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family so is margaret a mother who accepts her son s sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea you sort it out regardless the resonance of the deep end comes from two actors goran visnjic best known from the tv drama er is striking as a blackmailer unlike any you ve seen before he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol chivalry and simmering eroticism but the star of this show without a doubt is the remarkable tilda swinton watch the shadings depth resource vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her days after my second viewing of the deep end i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water the deep end is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it 
logical time travel movies are a near impossibility considering that the skeptic s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task occasionally we get a film that does manage it terry gilliam s monkeys was one such film but more frequently we get films that don t much deal with it at all there is one question to ask in this case does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies the terminator films made up for them with exciting action back to the future did it with an entertaining story and the new film frequency pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own is frequency filled with plot holes yes does it matter not really the film opens in october of firefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job then goes home to his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson the double pronged story flashes forward to where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working as a police detective a strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in and that john has found in the present day though both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women frank and john now must work together to set things right with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past the premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions this isn t explained you just have to go with it when frank doesn t die in a fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities and are to each other sometimes frank s changing the past results in something happening right away in john s world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time now the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if i thought about it hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer s murders was because the change had already happened in frank s world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanations aren t really the point when frequency gets cooking it s a riveting little thriller even if it is confusing what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment and frequency works as long as it keeps moving the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency as good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care for them and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved i liked many of the creative touches the split screens allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward it actually uses the mets orioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets to great effect frank uses john s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him admittedly this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself i even liked the final scene which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods some may find this scene blindingly confusing as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but it does make sense if you think about it and give the script a lot of leeway and let s face it it s a darn cool way to end the film there are enough surprises and plot twists in frequency to keep you on your toes and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant the other major thing to appreciate about frequency is the handling of the father son relationship quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily it s a rock solid job from both actors the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative or with a future descendant watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film if we don t believe in the characters we don t care about the outcome of the thriller plot here we do care because we like the lead actors i also liked some of the supporting cast members elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably andre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street gives a nice supporting turn as frank s best friend and future colleague of john he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank s world series predictions come true before his very eyes braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused perhaps the only thing i didn t like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during which the camera s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard but that s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics i freely acknowledge that frequency may best work as a guy movie since it focuses on the very male oriented idea of father son relationships echoes of field of dreams can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable who wouldn t want to speak with a long dead parent or see how their children turn out tell me about your life son excuse me while i mist up and don t call me a sissy 
 dangerous beauty is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa it is beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and certainly nothing short of entertaining but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness dealing with themes of forbidden love religious intolerance subordination of women sexual freedom and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high cultured society it still feels like brightly lit fluff the director marshall herskovitz doesn t want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down so he opts for a more genial livelier and relatively shallow interpretation the film takes place during the renaissance a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe at this time venice was its own republic and it thrived on being the central juncture of east west commerce the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived however there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment the story centers on veronica franco catherine mccormack a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier rufus sewell the son of wealthy aristocratic parents jeroen krabb and joanna cassidy unfortunately the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love rather it was more like a business transaction where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power wealth and ensure that outsiders couldn t get in veronica despite her charm and good looks is certainly an outsider after a short love affair marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her however because she is beautiful and intelligent veronica has a chance to enter marco s world albeit not as his wife she decides to become a courtesan a class of women who were as well educated as they were ravishing and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite a courtesan was not a mere prostitute they were afforded a special place in society and they were greatly revered respected and often envied at one point a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother paola jacqueline bisset who was once a famed courtesan herself once she enters the lifestyle veronica finds that it suits her quite well she is allowed to read all the books she wants she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet including the awestruck marco their relationship develops into a playful bantering with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco s advances in many ways their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love love the love not the man as her mother told her dangerous beauty which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice it has multiple plot lines including veronica s adversarial relationship with a court poet oliver platt her role in obtaining france s military assistance in venice s battle against the turks and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition yet it is never confusing or overbearing much of the film s success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson s ire in braveheart mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan her character is intelligent witty and both sensual and vulnerable all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes the rest of the roles are also filled well including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in dark city have assured him a solid place in hollywood he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy platt is a good actor but he s just too hard to hate jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was and even fred ward turns up in a small but moving performance as marco s uncle dangerous beauty is marshall herskovitz s sophomore directorial effort after the overlooked film jack the bear partnered with edward zwick herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television thirtysomething my so called life and in the movies legends of the fall his directing style can be best described as transparent it never gets in the way of the story yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions he could have approached the film in any number of ways including overdosing on the sexual aspect which he wisely avoids dangerous beauty contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic but not so much that it seems exploitative herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli whose previous efforts include the highly stylized thriller kalifornia and abel ferrara s dark sci fi film body snatchers bazelli captures the film in strong bold colors and be brings sixteenth century venice to life in wide panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery however the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood brazil the princess bride and the costumes by gabriella pescucci the age of innocence the only problem with dangerous beauty is that it doesn t stick with you it s a good story well told with interesting characters but it s easy to shrug off once you ve left the theater the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions but it never quite comes off because it s simply too melodramatic and conventional herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion and like the rest of the film it carries no real weight despite the potential severity of the subject matter 
not since oliver stone s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary and not since david cronenberg has a so called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility while fincher s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value his major character killings in both alien and seven are fine examples fight club marks the distillation of his pitch black comedic sensibility see s the game into something like a definitive statement jack norton acting as both narrator and protagonist is your typical cubicle clone whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia on the offhand advice of a doctor he sits in on group therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer here he meets bob marvin lee aday aka meat loaf a cancer emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia strangely the release he finds while sobbing on bob s breasts allows him to sleep at night at least until a fellow group therapy tourist named marla singer carter comes along to ruin things for him forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity later he meets tyler durden pitt a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life one night after his ikea furnished condo explodes don t ask you ll just have to see the movie awright he is goaded by tyler into a fight and damned if it doesn t feel good it is pure raw existence a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison he moves into tyler s squalid abandoned mansion and they form the titular organization an underground therapy group where men bond with bare knuckle savagery and very few rules the first two of which are don t talk about fight club armed with charisma and an attractive anti corporate philosophy tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white collar slaves and dead end mcemployees resentment creeps into jack s heart made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla funded by a frivolous lawsuit tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem their initially juvenile pranks like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads quickly evolve into something more like sedition and jack fears that things have gone sour it is after this point when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist it is so contrived and so conventional compared to what precedes it that everything which follows including the ending becomes far less interesting it s a major though not fatal flaw and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher it feels like a cop out fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people in the early going it has a downright dangerous feel it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it i ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don t spring up here and there and i ll be even more amazed if fincher isn t vilified for it by the same humorless witch hunters that are currently after oliver stone they needn t bother because fight club is less a message movie than fincher s elaborate attempt at a joke tyler durden for all his dionysian allure is really nothing more than the logical and far less hypocritical extrapolation of all those self help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me first gospel of self actualization in this context the joke works but like the latest columbine joke some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh and others won t hopefully though their silly moral outrage won t spoil the joke for the rest of us 
albert brooks saves the day just in the nick of time with a very poor summer for movies brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up and does so in a positive way while this may not be his finest work the muse still shakes up some delightful humor in albert brook s latest comedy he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter brooks who s losing his edge as his business partners say in desperation he goes to see his friend jack jeff bridges who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past he asks jack for some help and recieves word of a real life muse that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career so brooks seeks the muse named sarah sharon stone and is suckered into buying her expensive food etc as a sort of payment the real punch line however doesn t come until the end it really makes you wonder how screenwriters really get their ideas could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner speaking of brooks he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter every time he graces the screen i can t help but start laughing albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone she wasn t likeable at all brooks had the right idea with her occupation but she never pulled through in a way she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak luckily brooks could clean up the mess and cover for stone s mishap it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance because the muse had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy on a brighter note andie macdowell was also charming as brook s wife she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she s in the funniest moments in the muse in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese i mean imagine brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice like it was something out of the ordinary it was just plain hilarious it just adds to the satire joke of how directors get ideas brilliant move by brooks as i mentioned before the film is a satire much like it s proceeder bowfinger which came out a few weeks before unlike bowfinger this is not a mean spirited film that s desperate for jokes it s rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood bowfinger had it s moments but had quite a few problems that were never worked out but the muse still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour by the end of the film you re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it for once i m not fully disappointed because the film didn t slow down it kept moving even with some flaws thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort i think he ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future 
apollo is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer apart from swashbuckling braveheart director and former actor ron howard splash backdraft far away most noted for his dramatic film making displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer with more than us million in the states alone this film is his most successful effort yet perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks gump himself kevin bacon footloose tremors a few good men etc gary sinise forrest gump bill paxton aliens true lies boxing helena and ed harris the abyss just cause all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles apollo was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight the worst being the challenger accident jim lovell hanks the mission commander together with his crew fred haise paxton and last minute replacement tom swigert bacon are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission more than three quarters way to the moon suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home if they ever reach it ed harris and gary sinise who play respectively the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles both delve into their roles superbly audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space also there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into days of drama in the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well thanks to film music maestro james horner watch out for the launching sequence it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film a bad point though apollo features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script those who consider themselves scientifically illiterate might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show this is however just a minor point just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film you should enjoy it 
for those of us who weren t yet born when the s rock n rolled around monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies from otis redding to jimi hendrix janis joplin to the mamas and the papas and jefferson airplane to the who this documentary is jam packed with contagious energy but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves shot in at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time sure some have painted their faces and smoke joints but d a pennebaker the war room moon over broadway surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience no matter who is watching it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul the excitement starts before the music even begins a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer she replies that she feels lucky to do so there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers tries to get in touch with dionne warwick and when one band is tuning up a member remarks finally a decent sound system you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn t about vanity it s about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it a two way street this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience it s impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain and while the lyrics to wild thing may not be all that complicated watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love even if you don t recognize every band you see on stage you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats the only drawback to the film is the ending which unfortunately i must reveal all the other bands big names then and still today got approximately to minutes of screen time in contrast the last band on camera a wholly forgettable one gets an entire minutes of screen time for a film that s only minutes long that s too large of a chunk especially when previous acts are much more stimulating all in all monterey pop is a precious rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us the variety of music as well as the beautifully shot performances are easy to become immersed in if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular this is quickly dispelled it s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn t get made much anymore instead we re stuck with nsync the backstreet boys and jennifer lopez all of whom should have stuck with modeling 
plot a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum as each day passes the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion saying anything else about the plot would be a crime have fun critique i feel like shooting myself in the head are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here this ain t your average happy go lucky kind of picture this is a deliberately slow paced mystery horror film drenched in atmosphere with a very creepy insane asylum in which most of the film takes place very few clues up front and lots to talk about afterwards will it bore some people to sleep you bet it will is it made for the scream audiences of the day absolutely not i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the cerebral crowd a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame giving away very little with each step and each sound unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later i ve always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group in fact i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a mindfuck if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together well then this movie is definitely for you it s the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate damn i missed that whole peanut butter thing and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark brrrrrrrrr now what was that sound in the basement honey can you go check and one thing this film doesn t have unlike its hollywood ian counterparts like the haunting is special effects in fact that s one of the greater things about this movie it feels real because it looks like it s actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances i did some research and it was in fact shot on digital video ah ha another great thing about it is that it s actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen it s mostly implied kids and as clich d as it might be to say it s usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such other films that this one reminded me of include henry portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project with that same real sense of dread brooding and terror the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don t get into it completely you really need to concentrate here you will lose the motion of the story and the pent up tension might be released but overall this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can how can you go wrong definitely not a film for everyone but a must see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed count me in stanley kubrick would be proud oh yeah so where s that gun again where s joblo coming from the blair witch project blair witch the haunting the house on haunted hill lost highway the pledge the shining the sixth sense unbreakable 
bruce willis stars as malcolm an award winning child psychologist who discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from inner demons the now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his wife olivia williams from rushmore are celebrating his award shoots malcolm in the stomach then takes his own life almost nine months later malcolm discovers cole haley joel osment in a brilliant performance another young man afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient he takes on the child s case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous one alienating his wife in the process he soon discovers that they boy can see and speak to the dead and his life becomes forever turned upside down although the first hour is very slow the sixth sense turns out to be a very powerful and moving film i was expecting this film to be mercury rising but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller with an outstandingly satisfying ending you ll find yourself mentally retracing your steps through the film to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll i must give m night shyamalan a lot of credit for a brilliantly written screenplay the cast should also be given a lot of credit for making the movie as solid as it is a lesser cast could have made this film a joke bruce willis portrays his character perfectly balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully haley joel osment shines as nine year old cole showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off toni collette looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriel s wedding gives a strong performance as cole s mother who is trying to cope with both her son s illness and the passing of her mother finally olivia williams deftly portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband who s not around and flirtations with a co worker that could lead to a begrudgingly accepted end it s a shame that they show cole s abilities in the trailer because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same so we already know what s going on before most of the rest of the cast does in retrospect though the forty minute set up is essential to enjoying the end of the film so i have fewer complaints now then i did while i was watching the film i m glad that the run of teen styled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare films like this the similarly themed stir of echoes and countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty entertaining close to pg 
jake kasdan son of one of the best screenwriters around breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard to categorize detective story part mystery part comedy part character study and part romance for the most part kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film daryl zero bill pullman is a modern day sherlock holmes the parallel is present down to his love of music though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin and his addiction to drugs amphetamines rather than morphine he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces the case about the man who lied about his age or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes however zero s observance of the fine art of detachment though it makes him a brilliant private investigator makes him somewhat of a self imposed outcast in society he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr watson i mean steve arlo ben stiller arlo is not happy with his job he is thrilled to be around zero s brilliance but his bizarre behavior and strange requests are frustrating to the former lawyer and they re even more so to his girlfriend jess angela featherstone who is fed up that her boyfriend s boss means more to arlo than her this is the situation when a new case comes knocking gregory stark ryan o neill hires zero to find his lost keys it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence now stark is being blackmailed and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end to solve this case zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell however this is when he is vulnerable and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic gloria sullivan kim dickens who may be involved in the blackmail scheme for the first time zero has to question his own objectivity as he finds his client less and less sympathetic zero effect is weakest in its obviously wacky scenes depicting daryl zero s odd behavior such scenes might be appropriate in an out and out satire making zero an ace ventura ish character however there s a much meatier movie in here it just takes a while to get out that s not to say that there s not a place for humor in this film in fact some of the best scenes are ben stiller s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer however the over the top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film and they aren t funny enough to stand on their own once the investigation is underway however zero s brilliance really begins to shine his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock s own as the mystery begins to unfold zero s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions but never lose the viewer zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well zero s relationship with gloria is low key but it hits all the right notes however we are always kept distant from gloria s character she s given plenty of development but we never understand what she is thinking perhaps that may be intentional to place the audience in zero s zone of detachment but on the whole it is frustrating bill pullman when he s not spacing out creates a vibrant character in daryl zero there s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years and it is shockingly moving expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character but one which fits in well and although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called zero seriously it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name although zero effect is a bit awkward in places it is a strong debut for kasdan and shows great promise

your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about people who hop in and out of bed with each other written and directed by neil labute who s first film in the company of men was simply marvelous disappoints a bit here with this one the story involves two couples ben stiller catherine keener and aaron eckhart amy brenneman an artist assistant nastassja kinski and an egotistical women abuser jason patric the character s names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie each of the characters has their own sexual style and they don t seem to merge together well so the group experiments behind their respective partners back there are some hysterical scenes one involves jason patric aaron eckhart and ben stiller s characters they are all in a sauna talking about their best lay when jason patric s character makes a surprising confession the whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted the enjoyed this movie although it seemed a tad lengthy even though it only runs min the film s cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener aaron eckhart and jason patric i would not recommend this film to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit it did seem to offend people more than half of the people in the theater left during the film although your friends and neighbors doesn t have the power of labute s earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny while maintaining a melancholy philosophy on human relationships 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction the cinematic output from its creator quentin tarantino has been surprisingly low oh he s been busy doing the talk show circuit taking small roles in various films overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn making cameo appearances on television shows providing a vignette for the ill fated anthology four rooms everything it seems except direct another feature length film it s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr tarantino s new feature film jackie brown one of the most anticipated films of the year and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the s things aren t going well for jackie brown pam grier she s years old stuck at a dead end job a year plus retirement benefits that aren t worth a damn as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america and she s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton and police officer mark dargus michael bowen smuggling from mexico for gun runner ordell robbie samuel l jackson who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry robert forster the loquacious ordell based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny bong hitting surfer girl melanie bridget fonda and agreeable crony louis gara robert de niro hang out operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat and he s soon out to silence jackie brown meanwhile the authorities target is ordell and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half million dollars only through a series of clever twists turns and double crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses although jackie brown marks mr tarantino s first produced screenplay adaptation based on the elmore leonard novel rum punch there s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film while he s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character s now black in terms of ambiance the film harkens back to the s from the wall to wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage s productions the opening sequence featuring ms grier wordlessly striding through the lax funky music blaring away on the speakers is emblematic of films of that era the timeframe for the film is in fact but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro of course nothing in the film screams s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists backstabbing and deceptions deliciously unfold the strength of jackie brown is the quiet understated relationship developed between jackie and max when they kiss it s perhaps the most tender scene of the year tenderness in a quentin tarantino film sure there ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer or even in reservoir dogs where a deep unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters but for the most part mr tarantino s films are typified by manic energy unexpected outbursts of violence and clever often wordy banter these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown but what s new here is a different facet of his storytelling a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr tarantino as simply a helmer of slick hip crime dramas with fast talking lowlifes and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent he s the real deal this new aspect of mr tarantino s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character that of the world weary sensitive and exceedingly professional max cherry whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching mr forster s nuanced understated performance is the best in the film he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie we smile along with him much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation era icon pam grier in the lead with the wags buzzing that mr tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta s then sagging career as it turns out ms grier is solid in the film s title role although nothing here forces her to test her range i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection though she s been working steadily over the years often in direct to video action flicks but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton s mars attacks and larry cohen s original gangstas where she first teamed up with mr forster of course it s true that her role here was a godsend a meaty a part as this is rarity for any actress let alone one of her age and current status in the industry while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone it marks tremendous growth of mr tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding and whose characterizations have never been better and while the film s narrative doesn t really warrant a running time of minutes it s filled with such sumptuous riches ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining inconsequential conversations between the characters that there wasn t an unengaging moment with an impressive trio of feature films

 when you get out of jail you can kill him starring ashley judd tommy lee jones bruce greenwood rated r double jeopardy is a lurid prepostrous thriller that s also one of the year s most enjoyable it s an uncompromisingly brutal cheerfully anarchic hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it there is not a moment here when the events on screen don t have a direct bearing on the plot once the film gets going it never stops it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that s probably a correct assessment of the plot but the film itself has little in common with the andrew davis harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones not even bothering with character introduction director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get go and never finds the brake we meet rather hastily libby and nick parsons ashley judd and bruce greenwood respectively a seemingly happy married couple with a son matty age they go out on a sailboat one night and after a period of some rockin sex they go to sleep libby hears a strange noise wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood she follows a red trail to the upper deck where she finds a knife and out of astonishment picks it up at that convenient moment the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested her lawyer a friend puts up a defense in court but though we know she is innocent the evidence against her is too compelling her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison once in prison she makes a phone call to her friend her friend gives her son the phone nick walks in the room little matty screams daddy the phone goes dead libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn t even dead she gets some advice from a prisoner former lawyer who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband they can t convict her of the same crime again meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can t touch her after a weirdly short amount of time she gets out of parole she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees under the command of parole officer travis lehman tommy lee jones she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son s adopter double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime same time same place same circumstances it s not like it matters this is a rollickingly good thriller intense exciting fast and furious it s silly alright but this is the kind of film you just don t question in some films plausibility is everything double jeopardy however is not concerned with making sense its sole purpose is to entertain and it does judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role this is her breakout box office performance and she is terrific she brings some emotion to what could have been a one dimensional role giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive but the movie makes good use of his stone faced wit thankfully too double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film s story this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system it s great to see a movie that doesn t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure double jeopardy is really good but it isn t the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards it s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off otherwise your brain will be busy ruining your experience this is a thriller that isn t concerned with being smart or plausible instead it diverts all attention to the action which this year is second to none 
when i was growing up in s boys in my school used to divide into two groups based on their action movies preferences the first one myself included liked movies that featured spectacular car chases lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks probably because they could or to be more precise thought they could imitate its stunts in the real life decades later while refining my own cinematic taste i began to appreciate and actually like those movies probably because of overexposure to shoot em up idiocy of s ramboids yes most of the kung fu and other martial arts flicks were cheap they had predictable and formulaic plot and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills but in the same time those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation the best of those movies one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon made in in a joint hong kong hollywood venture it was intended to bring bruce lee s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience it succeeded but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island owned and controlled by han renegade shaolin monk interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics gun running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons o harra han s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee s sister years ago the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us williams played by jim kelly is black activist running from the racist police and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond the franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later the main hero was faced against a power hungry megalomaniac on a remote island alone against whole army of bad guys on the other hand lee was more believable hero than bond deprived of guns and super tech gadgets he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive in the same time the plot although extremely thin allowed him even some internal battles between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti violent philosophy the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence although two other main actors john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy were intended to share top spot with lee they served as nothing more than a comic relief it is a real shame to see kelly definitely the worse actor than saxon to steal the scenes from him only because his lines being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches sound so damn over the top other actors not including shih kien who turns han into typical although not very convincing bondian villain are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee among them is young jackie chan fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were years ago although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre in many way they are also more realistic they were personally staged by lee himself demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent i m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can t avoid to appreciate the difference from today s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end so despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top of all times enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don t like that particular genre 
imagine this you re given a sword and a shield and very basic minimal training a man you don t know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die you frantically monitor several closed doors which in seconds will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you you know you re going to have to do it all over again tomorrow eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are you re going to die this is the life of a gladiator you ll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott s powerful gladiator you ll be thankful for that with his new film scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire and like those preceding it spartacus and ben hur gladiator has nearly everything going for it a strong lead actor a wonderful supporting cast eye catching special effects and a great script since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator teenagers to thirty year old males were around a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited from a weak beginning the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious rome s best general maximus russell crowe who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted is currently in the year a d that is waging a war against germania scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective it s blurry in slow motion and the sound is muted as soon as this artistic method began it was hard to tell what was what and who was who it s a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch instead the general swears he will get out after this battle he wants to go back to his family and his crops he wants a quiet life but unexpectedly he gets anything but that the dying emperor of rome marcus aurelius richard harris decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators all of this does not go well for aurelius son commodus joaquin phoenix who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor jealous and upset commodus kills his own father names himself emperor kills maximus wife and son and attempts to kill maximus but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius wishes now a slave the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator who eventually are released for their success a story of betrayal and promises gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick you actually care about the characters sometimes even the evil villain commodus who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way phoenix plays his character brilliantly think of commodus as the percy wetmore of pant wetter the green mile of the roman empire a whiny sleazy respect me because my father was a good man brat who hates when he s not the center of attention every scene we see commodus he s either crying or he looks like he has just been crying phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for and gladiator shows he s more than just river s little brother crowe is also excellent as the film s grisly faced hero maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act he s no invincible superhero who only blurts out one liners he believe it or not acts like a human being the rest of the cast including richard harris djimon hounsou walter hill derek jacobi and connie nielsen are also first rate ridley scott using outstanding special effects has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum the loudness of the roman mob and the city of rome in general the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous like a cleopatra of the year the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper class politicians gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience along with u action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 
george little jonathan lipnicki wants a little brother after mr and mrs little hugh laurie and geena davis visit the orphange they decide to adopt stuart a talking mouse voiced by michael j fox george isn t so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house and neither is snowbell the family cat voiced by nathan lane george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race but snowbell wants stuart out of the house he s unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it s ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery cgi the character of stuart while obviously a computer generated image grows on you as the film progresses and you ll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film as many of the supporting cast are actual cats with computer animated mouths so they can speak it s fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with stuart little is a charming family film there are some great laughs in the movie with a script co written by the sixth sense s m night shyamalan no less some moments that can only be described as too cute the boat race sequence is what won me over and even the majority of the one liners common nowadays in children s films or films featuring nathan lane are tolerable kids and parents will love this one stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video there are two different dvds on sale one contains the film in full frame and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital audio both versions also contain the following extras and hang in there with me here there s a lot of them a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors an isolated score track an interactive trivia game an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo and a stuart little read along story which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you there are also three music videos and six theatrical trailers called thecatrical trailers get it it s funny for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases the adventures of elmo in grouchland madeline the nuttiest nutcracker muppets from space and baby geniuses the only bad thing about this entire dvd i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses dvd rom features are also on the disc including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd rom game but wait there s still more there s a section called basement treasures where you will find the auditions of the film s animators six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director a visual effects gag reel a production gag reel and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene with commentary from the director the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film s production minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski who wrote the people vs larry flynt and ed wood and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel who wrote splash and multiplicity among others anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track serious animation buffs will love the second one now i know this is slightly off topic but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called i need to know by a group called r angels this video features four mid teenage girls the singers obviously having a slumber party the girls ask a ouija board i need to know who to do who to do who to do as the song begins they then sneak out of their house and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like i ll be your pleasure all the time just say the words that you ll be mine um what the hell what does this have to do with stuart little how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd when the video concludes the words to be continued appear oh i can t wait to see who they ve slept with when the toy story dvd comes out kids won t care about most of the special features on this dvd but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a kid at heart thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them this is the way to do dvd a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost the di ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar 
after the average mouse hunt the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz dreamworks try again with the children s film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story as the film warns us at the beginning it s not the full story and some liberties have been taken but generally this the bible story we all know and love featuring burning bushes the plagues and the parting of the red sea the only thing missing is charlton heston instead we get val kilmer voicing moses an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt helen mirren we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses fiennes all grown up moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron sandra bullock and jeff goldblum that he isn t really the son of the pharaoh seti patrick stewart and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule he soon sets about this along with his wife tzipporah michelle pfeiffer rameses and his two wizard friends voiced by steve martin and martin short try to stop moses completing his task while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults for children reared on aladdin and hercules this film could be the most godawful thing they ve ever seen gone is the quick fire humour and standard easy to follow plot but spectacularly and to dreamworks credit nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen jeffrey katzenberg who produced this film certainly knows how to keep a child interested he s included some songs in the film plus some comedy and a exciting chariot chase to keep the children interested and somehow himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across without ever being boring it s a remarkable achievement also remarkable is the animation which puts hercules an almost slap dash effort to shame relying on hand drawn and computer animation the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed the film seems a little caught up with it s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and moving shots but they do look incredible the final plague where god kills every first born child and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed kudos to the animators the vocal talent is also very good val kilmer does a fine job as moses although he doesn t sing and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses and he does sing sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great and steve martin and martin short are very good but not in the film long enough finally michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife kudos also goes to the voice of god who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued sadly he is uncredited and i couldn t quite work out who the voice was but e mail if you do the songs are good ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number they don t disturb the movie and while not particularly memorable they are nice to listen to they re well sung aswell the musical score is suitably epic with some beautiful tunes coupled with the superb visuals the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat backed up with a great story entertaining both for kids and adults this film is a must see a david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes 
i swear i have seen the edge before in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into an entirely different film however the edge has done something that most action films should do and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot in doing so the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than say the peacemaker unfortunately because of those overused moments we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre intelligence even horror films have learned this a genre which is probably the least respected of them all the river wild was one of the best action suspense films i have seen from the s the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day the edge has the intelligence and smart characters but this time the lack of originality is the downfall i must admit that it was very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes this is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around as in the lost world if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity it could have become a great action film and i use the term loosely the edge is pretty much a survival of the fittest film but taking scream s lead the edge makes fun of the genre s cliches and then uses them though not quite as effectively charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him for once we don t immediately care for the main character instead we like bob alec baldwin a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic charles birthday is the same day and he receives a gold watch from his wife and a pocket knife from bob as action films go these items do have importance to the rest of the story but quite a bit more than we first expect soon however bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his personality charles bob bob s assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and as shown in the previews hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter down the plane goes the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film take for instance the entire man hunting bear plot this has been done many times in films with different animals and even bears but given the charles intelligence and bob s uncertainty many of the cliches are given fresh twists even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before my favorite line of the film comes from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didn t do the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability of the main plot a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when i realized that everything isn t as it seems anymore i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise so instead i will avoid it entirely the first two thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along and some of charles survival techniques seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the characters lose all sensibility i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while thankfully we already have begun to care for the characters and so we let this small detail slide but some of the technical details are awkward such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needles the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature and borders on phenomenal anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game baldwin can be a good or a bad character and here he succeeds at both in a way you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the double natured photographer elle macpherson gives a good performance albeit slight she isn t in the film all that much but for the scenes she does have she handles as an actress not as a model harold perrineau is a good actor and his scenes are nice and underplayed he is eliminated early and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable the edge is rated r for graphic violence some gore and language some of the violence is a little too disturbing even for me this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to but too many cliches bog it down director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts david mamet s script though has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn t end with the normal high strung action sequence but with a small detail involving a certain gift it s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear and by the way most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear way to go bart 
 oh my god i sounded just like a mother mrs pascal played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold tells her son didn t i sound just like a mother you are a mother her son marty tells her disgustedly i know but i still can t believe it i look at you people and wonder how did you ever fit in my womb marty you see is a grown up twin although his sister who thinks she is jackie o is certifiably insane marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes mother and daughter played in a brilliant performance by parker posey are both varying degrees of wacko most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is the daughter s fantasy of being jackie o is probably the most sane part of her being mrs pascal is the sort that will not let jackie o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level she explains to marty s new fiancee lesly tori spelling soon after their first meeting that jackie o was holding marty s private part when she came out of the womb the dialog by wendy macleod based on the play by mark waters is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment the script reminiscent of a david mamet play flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane in this storm are two sane individuals the fiancee is a giddy school girl type embarrassed by everything a complete contrast to her rival jackie o s bitter pseudo sophistication as the two twins younger brother anthony freddie prinze jr plays the all america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother s fiancee that night we all have our secrets jackie o tells her potential sister in law and boy does she have a few this is a house filled with them when lesly calls it the family s home to mrs pascal they ve never had a visitor before lesly mrs pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their house in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase made for each other the twin s biggest but not their only secret is that they ve had a long term incestuous relationship they don t like to discuss it although they are not particularly ashamed of it perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy this story never pulls its punches jackie o tries in many ways few subtle to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best director mark waters keeps the show s energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it jackie o is temperamentally incapable of being nice and being jealous she cuts lesly down mercilessly were you poor jackie o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished did you eat pies chicken pot pies pancakes actually lots of pancakes lesly replies with her usual sincerity a donut king so is she like the queen jackie o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king are we entertaining royalty with rolfe kent s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed will it end in a big emotional explosion a murder people slowly cutting each other up with words a familial catharsis a weather disaster or what the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell i ll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise the house of yes runs a blazing fast it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations mature themes violent overtones and some profanity the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers i e treat the movie as it were rated nc 
in the sweet hereafter writer director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living he shows us how it isn t dying that hurts but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings on a cold winter day in a small isolated town in british columbia a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake where it cracks through the ice and sinks fourteen children die and numerous others are hurt for the residents of this small town all of whose children were on that bus it is an earth shattering event that resolutely alters their lives they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle alberta and risa walker who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ian holm to bring a lawsuit against someone anyone for responsibility the bus driver dolores driscoll gabrielle rose is a kindly woman who loved the children and although she lives with a burden of guilt is not held responsible for the accident the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice and there was nothing should could do to prevent it however according to stephens there are no accidents in life and someone will pay for this tragedy whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through he goes through the town approaching the parents who have lost children asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger and for his work stephens will receive one third of the settlement money however it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money he is driven by something else something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents he has lost a child too but not in the same manner his daughter zoe caerthan banks who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite has been in and out of drug re hab clinics and detox stations for ten years she calls him on an irregular basis begging him for money but refusing to tell him what she needs it for i don t know who i m taking to he tells her in his mind his daughter is dead the lawsuit is to stephens not only a way to mend the town s pain but also his own however not everyone in town wants it to happen billy ansell bruce greenwood who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children wants nothing to do with it he has already lost his wife and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman he doesn t want to talk about the accident and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds to him the town should be able to take care of its own pain and it doesn t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way central to the sweet hereafter is the tale of nicole burnell sarah polley a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into a wheelchair girl as she puts it aside from stephens nicole is the most complex character in the film and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out it is also her sad haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack reading robert browning s poem about the pied piper and how when he led all the town s children away one was left behind because he was crippled obviously nicole is that child and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town s children left her alone by dying in the wreck her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving but incestuous relationship with her father tom mccamus there is only one fleeting scene that suggests this relationship but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film of all the storylines in the sweet hereafter this is the most complicated and unresolved although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers if any at all and he doesn t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up what egoyan has done in the sweet hereafter is really nothing short of miraculous in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life egoyan has always been a talented but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold the sweet hereafter is quite the opposite egoyan s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion and draw the audience into the tragedy the sweet hereafter seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked the film is filled with beautiful subtle performances from all the actors especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind the beautiful roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting melodic musical score by mychael danna both previous egoyan collaborators give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements like his earlier films egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole he works with time as a fluid substance shifting back and forth between the past the distant past and the present with effortless ease the actual bus wreck itself doesn t happen until midway through the film but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail and still have it carry great devastating weight because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple direct terms certainly one of the best films of the sweet hereafter is a deeply rewarding mystifying and ultimately human film 
along his carreer mel gibson has collected several successes not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view for all that i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace a popular scotch hero of the th century where he would also perform the principal role accepting so huge challenge mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years with a suppoosed failure just to see recognized by everyone all his potentialities and that way to consolidate his position in hollywood it was definitely an enormous risk but i m sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face braveheart is in fact a magnificent and magisterial film for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative s rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest the william wallace s story is the story of so many others brave liberty s defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value along the centuries seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i king of england in a war by the autonomy of scotland as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone including the princess isabelle of wales wife of edward s son however william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty nowadays mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i the king longshank the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good sophie marceau as princess isabelle has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen as robert the bruce and of course mel gibson as william wallace however i think this time the mel gibson s work as director was much better than his work as actor the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes view by the camera of john toll then we realize all the beauty of this film braveheart is in my opinion one of the best movies of i ve heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean for now let s see if braveheart equalizes the oscars of lawrence of arabia it won t be easy it s gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson 
call it touched by a demon gregory hoblit s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual horrific twist if marketed properly this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven in fact there s even a little twin peaks to be found here albeit with the lion s share of the weirdness distilled out remember bob the biggest failing of fallen is that although it s consistently interesting it s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope a serial killer elias koteas has been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force has brought him to justice now during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes what goes around really goes around shortly thereafter he begins to sing time is on my side as he s taken on his last walk minutes later the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead but for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese wasn t a normal psychopath he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel and with reese s death azazel is free to hop from body to body murdering and wreaking havoc at will only hobbes and a pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what they re up against the rest of the cops including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini a newcomer to the department and lieutenant stanton donald sutherland don t have a clue and as a result they are in mortal danger as depicted by hoblit primal fear and cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia is a dark dreary place a gothic city rather than a modern one no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown the most famous landmark to appear isn t the liberty bell or independence hall it s geno s steaks shadows and night scenes abound the days are cloudy and unpromising this is the kind of setting where it s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men fallen s plot is brimming with potential not all of which is realized somehow i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise but the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check nevertheless there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual of the several dozen actors to play azazel the best is by far elias koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minutes gives a fantastically charged performance john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick sadly however these two are the only ones who excel everyone else including denzel washington is boring washington s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film it s not that he s bad per se but he s not very interesting there s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keeps us distanced however slightly from hobbes as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop and as his life or death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was washington s subdued approach is part of the reason for this i never felt a sense of urgency however at least washington was believable which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindler s list and donald sutherland to be fair the flaws in their characters aren t all acting related neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written that said however there s nothing inspired about either davidtz s or sutherland s work both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi dimensional individual narratively fallen has a few glaring weaknesses although the plot proceeds with a convoluted game like structure it uses a denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matters at times this is actually helpful and it has a use beyond the obvious but there are occasions when ponderous lines like i like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself become a little hard to swallow in addition fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel however despite the negatives i m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending which i loved the final scenes are startling audacious and unexpected it s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself this is not a great motion picture but considering how bad most january releases are it s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours and whatever you do don t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll 
gere willis poitier chase each other around the world the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman when the soviet union imploded the western countries lost their shadow with the united states friendly with the russians we no longer had an entity to blame for the world s problems this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy it s time to rejoice because we ve found our new villain now it s no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands it s the russian mafia a perfect solution it combines the dread of organized crime and the still present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries best of all the villains are still foreigners fear of the other always plays best so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal bruce willis to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they re not sure even exists coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen richard gere who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston sidney poitier and russian major valentina koslova diane venora mulqueen s ex girlfriend basque terrorist isabella mathilda may is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn t slip away crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini van the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers being very loosely based on the same book the thriller the day of the jackal comparison between the two films is inevitable there is no doubt that the original is the better movie playing the story for suspense rather than the current action adventure as a mystery the jackal has enough holes in it to ruin the tale but if you can accept it for what it is there s entertainment to be had holes let s see a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up for a year veteran that can command the big bucks the jackal is an incredibly poor shot the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police but it s just the two of them willis disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer s in the saint and lest you misunderstand that s not a compliment but the three stars are fun to watch it s good to see gere in something other than a business suit willis has a mixed history in picking projects but his characters are always watchable poitier is by far the superior actor but has limited screen time the problems in logic are flaws but don t ruin the experience occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes this is one of them the appeared in the bloomington voice bloomington indiana 
the italian hitchcock and acknowledged master of the giallo murder mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino jennifer connelly a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school s population terrified a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist donald pleasance leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift phenomena is an imaginative original thriller writer director argento creates several sequences of surreal haunting beauty here including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer s beckoning the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer s identity is genuinely shocking and surprising the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden ex rolling stone bill wyman and argento s favourite gothic electronic outfit goblin but it gels surprisingly well the film s opening music reccurs several times an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone argento fans beware the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re titled as creepers this deleted nearly half an hour of footage mainly of key dialogue scenes

note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned on december amidst all the year end oscar bait releases from the major studios miramax s genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream although the teen horror market had been given up for all but dead in recent years the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns eventually topping million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry suddenly everybody was looking for hip inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost scream director wes craven previously best known as the creator of new line s a nightmare on elm street film series was thrust back into the limelight and scream s rookie scribe kevin williamson burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion it s hard to understate this last point mr williamson has based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing scream i know what you did last summer from october and now scream enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame quickly become the most well known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly reading box office figure watching youth culture since well since that quentin tarantino guy whom it is said has also achieved some renown as a director indeed in a singularly freakish oddity it is the screenwriter mr williamson and not the director that has been receiving the lion s share of acclaim for the success of scream and the print advertisements for scream s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence while the traditional a film by wes craven drapes the film s title in the ads right below it in equal sized font yet reads written by kevin williamson an affirmation of the screenwriter s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented i can envision the board of wga licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of a film by is attained and much like mr tarantino s screenwriting mr williamson s work is vaguely unconventional incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters in scream they satirically discussed other horror films here in the sequel the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels scream was written in during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood and mr williamson s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel while the sequel was planned from the outset a treatment of scream was included when mr williamson sold the screenplay for scream the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived and it s only at about the film s midway point when it becomes engaging like its predecessor scream opens with a splashy eye grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film s principal narrative this time around we re following the exploits of a young couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab a running film within a film gag where the true life events behind the first film has been turned into a movie however although it tries hard and has some good ideas the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore where her performance not only convinced me that she could act but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i ve ever seen there are too many knowing hip pop culture references crammed into the scream sequence and the setup isn t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream s while the first film s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying the payoff here is almost campily theatrical flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college where returning characters sidney neve campbell and randy jamie kennedy have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors single minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers courteney cox roars into town to cover the breaking story while ever awkward former deputy dewey riley david arquette flies in to protectively guard over sidney they re joined by cotton weary liev schreiber who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film his role here is significantly expanded the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn t necessary not because so many people have seen the first installment but because this is after all a sequel to a slasher film what do you think happened to these characters in the prior movie there s a lot of new faces on the scene too sidney s new boyfriend derek jerry o connell and her new roommate hallie elise neal randy s fellow film student mickey timothy olyphant gale s newly assigned nervous cameraman joel duane martin omnipresent local journalist debbie salt laurie metcalf co ed cici cooper ms buffy herself sarah michelle gellar and a pair of simpering sorority sisters rebecca gayheart and sirens portia di rossi any of these characters could be the killer or for that matter could be the next victim as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly flimsy premise of a whodunit one problem that scream didn t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer here and to some extent in i know what you did last summer mr williamson s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements it doesn t help matters any that the killer s alter ego is fairly obvious from the get go indeed the finale plays as full out camp when the villain is finally unmasked frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations scheming and motivation that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived the aspect where it s head and shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences they re staged much more imaginatively here save for the first post prologue murder which is handled in such a mediocre conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable s slasher flicks that the first film satirized and are much more fun to watch it s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck and a cat and mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown in terms of its characters the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well written and there s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed on the other hand sidney is pretty dull here she doesn t have any compelling presence and there s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she s the returning heroine given this and the fact that there s no strong second banana character for sidney elise neal s role isn t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan s shoes it s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film what surprises me the most about scream is its zealousness in decimating its cast the film s mounting body count bears out the fact that no character is safe well almost while in principal i applaud this bold policy at some point you ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular whose casting for the next installment of the series would ve seemed obvious but hey as rose mcgowan s character said in the first film no please don t kill me mr ghostface i want to be in the sequel look what that got her 
review peter jackson s the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie and still coming in at the extremely cheap million price tag but for those who were dismayed by this year s blockbusters like twister and independence day the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high profile movie can get michael j fox stars as frank bannister a con artist who can speak to ghosts he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people then he comes and pretends to get rid of them this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash years ago frank s latest customers are a young couple played by trini alvarado and peter dobson when dobson ends up dead alvarado starts to take an interest in fox but dobson s spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he s dead this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado with dobson tagging along as a ghost things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims but noone else can see that so when fox shows up to try and save each victim naturally people suspect he is the killer fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector s hit list and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox s attempts to save her from this evil spirit there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh the movie starts off as a black comedy and ends up a horror action film the mix between these genres are perfect no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror and vice versa one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form michael j fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife s death and then is forced to confront this later on alvarado looking like andie macdowell makes a great frightened tough and smart heroine and jeffery combs as a paranoid fbi agent is brilliantly bizaare the frighteners never once feels like it is running long the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters this movie is probably what casper would ve looked like if david lynch directed it it s easily the best film of the year so far

in daylight sylvester stallone breaks no new ground cinematically speaking but he covers familiar territory quite well yesterday as i was going about my business in the university bookstore i noticed this stand with these daylight movie posters on it i had never heard of the movie so i stopped by to check it out it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering so i shrugged thought hey they probably won t give me the card anyway and i could always use a free movie so i signed up all in all i don t think i got that bad of a deal either rob cohen who has previously brought us such films as dragon the bruce lee story and more recently dragonheart gee i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason you think now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture with fx by industrial light and magic about the after effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey sylvester stallone plays kit latura who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in cliffhanger a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed when the crisis hits he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out there are other similarities to cliffhanger too perhaps the only real difference is that cliffhanger had a villain where daylight s bad guy is mother nature in fact had the two movies been made in hong kong this might have been titled cliffhanger ii it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film sequels do to their predecessors the first half hour of daylight is setup subplots are woven and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled we meet all the important people toxic waste disposal truck drivers a young frustrated jilted rejected playwright a family struggling to stay together an older couple and their dog a truckload of prisoners an ad agency executive a tunnel police officer stallone and others we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons and then thirty minutes into the film boom and it s a big one from there on in it s sly stallone to the rescue and rescue he does enduring batterings beatings falls repeated immersion in degree water explosions mud rats and constant setbacks before going on to save the day sly style again there s nothing new here and yet there doesn t need to be the fun of daylight is not in the story but in the execution the special effects are first rate thanks to industrial light and magic and the ensemble cast works well together once the film hits its stride it carries the viewer right along to the finish with very few jars along the way this review is copyright by christopher e meadows permission granted for distribution through rec arts movies reviews and all associated archival permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached all other rights reserved to the author 
 the tailor of panama is a different kind of spy movie despite the presence of pierce brosnan there is nary a hint of james bond flash here instead of big action scenes leering super villains and empty headed femme fatales we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation based on the novel by john le carr who also co wrote the screenplay the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year a solid well told story brosnan plays andy osnard a british operative walking on thin ice his british superiors ship him off to panama making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co workers and his new home base when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that since the creation of the panama canal the structure is the sole connection between north and south america he barely keeps from yawning brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end searching for a way to get information on the government osnard sets his sights on harry pendel geoffrey rush an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite harry claims to be a transplant from britain s renowned saville row but osnard knows his secret the tailor is an ex con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle s shop in an insurance scam he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm osnard offers harry a way out he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele eager to comply harry offers what he knows then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing before long he is forced to spy on his loving wife louisa jamie lee curtis an aide to the canal director harry s little lies build eventually taking on a life of their own osnard turns in reports about the silent opposition a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal the bogus revelation proves explosive leading to meetings in washington d c over how to best protect the vital waterway meanwhile osnard wallows in his newfound status enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co worker and harry grows ever more fretful fearing the consequences if his clients not to mention his wife learn about his lies geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor rush makes harry a credible figure presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity after gaining fame playing larger than life characters rush flips everything around for this role using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems although she gets far too little screen time jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her of the central characters she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self confidence curtis is one of my favorite female actors whiplash smart sultry and charismatic she deserves more than supporting roles speaking of supporting characters there are some great ones here harold pinter is amusing as harry s uncle benny who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr strangelove school of armed patriotism but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson both outstanding as two wounded activists their presence adds weight to the story reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there the metropolis described by one character as casablanca without heroes pulsates with life underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people the tailor of panama succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment 
when i first saw the previews for ron howard s latest film my expectations were discouragingly low a show about nothing sounds like seinfeld a guy whose entire life is broadcast hours a day sounds like the truman show what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants another puts one out about bugs which is why i was pleasantly surprised by edtv which turns out to be a fresh insightful and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity the writing by howard s longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus in the hands of a less experienced director edtv could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday s meatloaf with their true tv cable ratings being threatened by the gardening channel apparently people would rather watch soil the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers program director cynthia topping ellen degeneres comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment the hook is to find a regular guy someone normal that people can relate to while scouting possible candidates cynthia s camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray woody harrelson in a bar where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame but on watching the videotape the show s producers are more taken with ed than with ray he s cute he says all the wrong things and he s usda hick cynthia s boss played by rob reiner gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it s tough going in the early stages the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth action shot wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster you get the idea but soon enough things nielsen boosting kinds of things start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the true tv cameras are right there to document it ed s privacy is no longer his own his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media who should ed go out with you can be sure the pollsters have a list not only is the film exceedingly well cast but its performers are consistently excellent matthew mcconaughey provides the face the body language and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america s latest phenomenon he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed s mother and martin landau is one of the film s highlights as al ed s ailing stepfather jenna elfman from tv s dharma and greg proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting even degeneres and reiner are better than you d expect in writer director comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called real life in which a small time opportunist makes a real time documentary about a typical american family the scenes of ed s family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big budget variant on that film paralleling its wickedly inventive humor as with most films by albert brooks real life was funny but absurd the funniest and scariest thing about edtv is that it is absolutely believable 
billy bob thornton who had a sudden rise to fame with s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer is becoming one of the most versatile and most accomplished american actors around at the moment as jacob the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton s hank thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers three men hank paxton jacob thornton and their friend lou brent briscoe stumble upon a plane wreck which upon closer inspection yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money jacob and lou want to pocket the cash hank the smarter and perhaps more naive of the three insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find eventually they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found and then split the money three ways things start going wrong though with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan disaster is sure to strike director sam raimi of the evil dead and darkman fame has made an excellent and thought provoking film worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come scott b smith s screenplay based on his novel which i haven t read is a fine example of escalating tension while it does remind one of danny boyle s shallow grave without the abundance of black humour it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality or the lack thereof found in a film with this subject matter alar kivilo s cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen s fargo with the bleak snowy landscape almost becoming another character danny elfman also does well with his moody finely written score if there s a flaw in the film it s that it goes on for just a little too long just when we think that they are about to wrap things up raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further while this isn t really a bad thing it did become a little frustrating at times this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand the performances are excellent with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene stealing turn as hank s scheming wife this is an excellent showcase for thornton s fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films fingers crossed though that this doesn t stop him from making another evil dead sequel

 being john malkovich is the type of film we need to see more today s films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas or those that have similar themes malkovich falls under none of these categories and it s quite refreshing to see that occur this strangely provoking story is actually somewhat understandable john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time his wife cameron diaz supports the both of them by working at a petstore which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job he finds an ad for a filing clerk when he reaches the building he arrives at a floor it s there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for minutes at a time meanwhile cusack meets a business partner catherine keener in which he falls madly in love with her the only problem is she has no interest in him what so ever the whole portal thing isn t just a toy in fact it becomes cusack s dream being inside malkovich s mind gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich like a puppet and to fulfill his fantasies i don t want to give away too much but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery in my opinion this idea is absolutely brilliant it s really quite scary to think that someone could become you control you be you it makes you wonder why we act like we do and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue even if the script is super sharp i can t help but find the ending displeasing it could have lead up to something more or at least an amusing conclusion it tried to explain a mythology about the portals that made it seem rushed other than that i had a very enjoyable time the acting was quite delightful as well john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability and he does it well he s by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity but i m hoping that will change cameron diaz was her usual charming self although i felt that part was wrong for her but she pulled it off john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice who else s mind would be better to explore the director spike jonze who appeared in last month s three kings really catches my attention with this project i knew he was bizzare but not to this extreme he too is likely too receive media attention being john malkovich isn t an excellent film but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite what s even better is the film s puzzling message am i nick lyons 
hedwig john cameron mitchell was born a boy named hansel in east berlin as a teen seeking his other half he reluctantly agrees to a sex change operation in order to marry american g i luther maurice dean wint the operation performed by a hack surgeon is botched and the angry inch is all that s left now a she hedwig comes to america is abandoned by luther forms a rock band and falls for her year old lover prot g tommy only to be rejected by him later too she and her band the angry inch shadows the now famous tommy gnosis across the us for revenge but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in hedwig and the angry inch first time helmer john cameron mitchell along with composer lyricist stephen trask created and starred in their acclaimed off broadway production that has become the movie and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs outrageous costumes sets and makeup and especially a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for i am by far not a big fan of musicals sure there are exceptions like bob fosse s all that jazz and cabaret but for the most part they are just not my cup of tea hedwig and the angry inch is an exception though with its combination of humor wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from the rocky horror picture show and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols the original songs by stephen trask also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch are full of energy and variety and even though it s not my kind of music i found every one entertaining and fun the audience i saw hedwig with thought so too the main attraction to this one man woman show is the presence of its star john cameron mitchell gives a solid sometimes fun sometimes angry performance as a person searching for self enlightenment and love as a young boy growing up in east berlin hansel is abused by his g i father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that mother would make me play in the oven where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio later as a young man he meets luther another g i and is swept off of his feet the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after flash forward to a trailer park in junction city kansas and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy frustrated and broke she takes on baby sitting and the odd job to make ends meet she also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born she meets falls for and loses young tommy who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation jealous and angry hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommy s tours and with the help of her manager phyllis stein andrea martin is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs hedwig and the angry inch get gigs not coincidentally at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing things finally come to a head so to speak in new york city the popularity of the off broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready made audience base for hedwig the wit humor music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been it is this one man woman show that casts its spotlight on its internationally ignored rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role there isn t a lot going on with other characters though there are amusing little sidebars like hedwig s backup singer lover yitzak miriam shor deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of rent as a puerto rican drag queen the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film attention to details hedwig s costumes and outrageous cabaret like makeup the seedy trailer park setting and the kitschy seafood restaurants are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds all on what has to be a beer budget hedwig and the angry inch may not be for everybody but the energy of the effort the songs the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch if you re a fan of contemporary edgy music it is an even bigger draw i give it a b 
one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids although black and white films are frequently viewed as suspect ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind and if you can find a colorful action film even if it is from six decades ago then there is a real possibility of a take home hit so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood a high spirited version of the walter scott story nominated for the academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold s melodramatic music ralph dawson s fast paced editing and carl jules weyl s lush sets the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley a k a robin hood flynn with his handsome figure and toothy smile charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household the littlest rhodes jeffrey age liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more i ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review simply stated the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre the swashbuckler robin with a smile from ear to ear fights off a hundred men without a scratch although the picture can be considered as little more than a s james bond the production values and the acting raise it above that level robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows in this movie however he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country robin with his courage and athletic skills serves as a role model for kids and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy eyed lady marian fitzswalter the story has heavy romantic overtones filmed in the typical richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players in scene after scene the picture charms the audience who wouldn t fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest even if the outcome is so clearly preordained and of course he doesn t just win he does so by splitting the other man s arrow watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments sherlock holmes as the villain sir guy of gisbourne for example just doesn t seem right even if basil rathbone did have a real life identity outside of his most famous role and then there are those wigs from the makeup department so bad they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy as was popular in the cinema of that era people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks bad guys are banished rather than killed and lovers go off hand in hand doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful cartoonish figures hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore so try to savor the old ones when you can the adventures of robin hood runs it is not rated but containing absolutely nothing offensive it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages jeffrey thinks the film is great and gives it he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures he hates the sight of blood in movies his favorite parts are the battles and the ending and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ian hunter 
on the basis of this film alone i never would have predicted that in two years quentin tarantino would become the country s biggest hotshot director reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction but is a much less substantive more conventional crime story than the big pf here s what the two movies do have in common scenes of intelligent amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical chronological sequence graphic yet necessary violence an engaging crime story dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial gender slurs three of the same actors harvey keitel tim roth and steve buscemi a mexican standoff ending although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it s only got one story to tell rather than three crime lord joe cabot veteran actor lawrence tierney has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated instead they are all given code names off the color chart mr white keitel mr pink buscemi mr orange roth mr blonde michael madsen mr brown tarantino and mr peach tarantino s chin most of the movie s running time is spent with mr white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive mr orange meanwhile is on the floor dying from a gunshot wound the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon leading white to believe one of the five was an informant the story s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime eventually blonde arrives with a police officer hostage and what follows is a truly brutal uncomfortable torture scene let s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop s ear a lot of the time reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist gone wrong movie but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn t live up to as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on among other things tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna s like a virgin another scene involves roth s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie reservoir dogs is good but it s no pulp fiction 
 pleasantville taps into hollywood s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed www pleasantville com april friday cast tobey maguire reese witherspoon william h macy joan allen j t walsh jeff daniels mpaa rating pg for sexual content and thematic elements genre drama in my opinion in short it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film one can easily be misled as to what the real message is review in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life such as rain fire or emotions the town of pleasantville has one adjective pleasant there is no sadness no fear no danger no discomfort no love and no hate put simply it s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for j one big note however is that it is only a s sitcom that airs in reruns on an oldies tv station or is it i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back more times in the period it endured at the box office but it wasn t until months later when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy dollar theaters after not having seen it for so long that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some healthy immorality is not a world at all instead the actual message which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of is that a world without immorality doesn t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself because everything is automatically right there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made no space for growth and never anything new to learn and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story now i m not saying that s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white it s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more a truly intelligent addition to it all however is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork that said the plot goes as such david and jennifer are two very s high school twins with the typical relationship outline of don t mess with my life and i won t mess with yours they demonstrate the well known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today david is the shyer subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv while jennifer is the wild licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home nevertheless jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed and as said earlier not to flip the town around into some corrupt society but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place people got hurt they cried they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves and that s when their physical world turned colors as well this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie but to me the message is finally clear i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run we ll never know what we could have done better until the next great movie i see i remain sincerely danielle flynn imr 
few films in have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker s adaptation of frank mccourt s memoir angela s ashes many dismissed it as an humorless sentimentalized uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel others hailed it as a heartfelt sincere portrait of the human spirit i m somewhere in between leaning strongly towards the latter it s certainly well made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two and a half hour running time that screams i m important mccourt s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early s a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us as he comments we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty in ireland frank played by joe breen as a small child his brothers his mother angela emily watson and his father malachy robert carlyle get financial help from angela s mother a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman she helps them get a rat infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job positions are scarce and when he does finally find one he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking meanwhile frank goes to an uptight catholic school where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires two of frank s brothers soon die crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition as if the poverty and the suffering weren t intense enough as it stood malachy and angela have another baby worsening the situation further i imagine this doesn t sound like much of a plot that s probably because it isn t one these are people this is their story director alan parker the commitments knows how to tell a good story and angela s ashes despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue supplementing parker s able direction are the engaging often poignant performances of the leads some of them seasoned thespians others relative beginners carlyle the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character we empathize with the guy but we don t like or admire him emily watson turns in a heartfelt sincere supporting performance it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats also worthy of mention is little joe breen whose face graces the film s superb poster it is breen s first feature film and he s extraordinary as young frank not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense you can peer into the character s soul through breen s sad eyes on the flip side one thing that could have vastly improved angela s ashes is a more decisive editor while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage the first half especially could have been trimmed down bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process things pick up at about the halfway point sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary spoiler warning skip next paragraph if in suspense the film s final message is somewhat conflicted as frankie in effect leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america what exactly are we supposed to make of that his mother doesn t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son as any mother would but it still seems inconsiderate of him i haven t read the book but i m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein therefore i m suspicious another thing that s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title which i m sure is also explained in the memoir if seen as a film onto itself rather than an adaptation angela s ashes stands tall despite a few minor setbacks it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder 
 very bad things is the most delightfully morbid film of the year a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn t help but be won over by the material the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas the groom to be is kyle fisher jon favreau who is about to be married to the controlling wedding obsessed laura cameron diaz the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd christian slater quiet charles leland orser and brothers michael jeremy piven and family man adam daniel stern after a wild night of gambling boozing and drugs a stripper carla scott who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room but after a freak accident to everyone s terror she is killed as robert puts it there are two options go to the police and go to prison or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body robert is forced to kill him as well okay there is only one option now you can forget about calling the police he says by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer most of them are overcome with guilt which sets off an even more elaborate series of event that includes much much more murder double crosses and the inevitable wedding from hell very bad things which is actor peter berg s feature film directing debut is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that there s something about mary wanted to be it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh original and hilarious even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence gore and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end the screenplay also written by berg is to put it mildly very funny and courageous during the second act of the film some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death which was beginning to undermine the humor but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed the dialogue is edgy and inventive and this film proves that a movie doesn t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable there s more fun i think in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger and reciting lines like stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs i couldn t help but crack up at how balls to the wall this film had become jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original as daniel stern s wife who late in the picture we discover is a tough kick boxer that should not be messed around with it is at this level that very bad things was so entertaining and surprising just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over the top although i enjoyed the film immensely let me make this clear very bad things is not a movie for everyone it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen it is more violent and bloody than a r rated film usually is and it is offensive luckily these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no holds barred politically incorrect comedy the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and safe wide releases coming out lately still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry 
it s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year but that is what disney and pixar animation s latest film represents while a bugs life isn t nearly as deep as it s predecessor dreamwork s antz it is just as funny a bug s life centers appropriately around the life of an ant named flik flik cutely voiced by newsradio s david foley hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission they never dream he will be successful they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food flik s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs who he mistakenly assumes are warriors when he returns with the warriors the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes a bug s life has animation that is simply stunning the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative together with the great voice acting this film is the perfect holiday family film its main weakness is that it couldn t beat antz to the theaters making it seem like stale material 
recently i read reviews of pleasantville one from entertainment weekly one from a newsgroup and two from different online resources each review compared this film to the truman show why the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television other than that the two movies are completely different from each other reviewers seem to love to pick one movie i e the truman show obsess over it and make it a guideline for other movies when pleasantville and edtv opened all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman the same goes for the thin red line as well when it opened in decemeber probably of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg s saving private ryan giving thin line no chance whatsoever critics loved private ryan so much that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards this is why i think pleasantville was underrated if the truman show had never been made pleasantville probably would have received better reviews done better at the box office and would be remembered after it s long been on the video store shelves sure it wasn t perfect and it wasn t very believeable but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history with the exception of don knotts as the annoying tv repairman the film is cast perfectly the ice storm s tobey maguire is david in real life he watches the old s sitcom pleasantville to escape from his feuding parents his twin sister jen reese witherspoon is a popular slut who steriotypically smokes and wears revealing clothes but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue those excessive s terms such as like whatever and cool make her sound like the total dimwit she s supposed to be the twins with a little help from a tv repairman casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo esque cast rather than a true acting one are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote their new parents played by william h macy and joan allen are perfect in every way their new names are bud and mary sue and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles the movie begins to take form it s just like watching a sitcom in itself you don t want it to end mary sue has sex with her date the school basketball champion when he tells all his friends about it they stop preforming perfectly at basketball and things start to take color soon we learn that these people don t know how to express true emotions and when they learn to do so they eventually turn into color this eventually sparks a racial war between the coloreds and the black whites entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has none of the depth poignance and brilliance of the truman show yes the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent but the racial setting intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom certainly classifies as deep considering it s what i least expected gary ross did not try to create an intelligent award masterpiece he just tries to convey moral messages within his work take for example big and dave his past films big be careful what you wish for dave good or bad lying is still lying did these movies win big awards no but they won the heart of millions pleasantville could have done that too if it wasn t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films pleasantville a ad am i almost lost my nose and i like it i like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown 
three things i learned from being john malkovich when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the th floor of a building always bring your crowbar don t stand in the way of your wife s actualization as a man and whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being wear old clothes because hey it s muddy in there being john malkovich is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time wildly surrealistic yet presented in a down to earth funky style this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself there s a lot to think about here just don t forget to have fun clearly all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did starting with writer charles kaufman i wrote being john malkovich without an outline he explains in the press notes blindly with no sense of direction or purpose it s important to me that i don t have a map before i start this allows me to surprise myself stay engaged discover things and hopefully allow the unconscious to surface spike jonze mark wahlberg s na ve buddy in three kings takes it from there the white hot director of the beastie boy s sabotage an award winning parody of s tv cop shows as well as numerous other music videos and commercials eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low key style his flat matter of fact approach works perfectly and then there s the cast john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive but decidedly erotic puppet shows over the years his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte cameron diaz has devolved once passionate lovers the two are now little more than courteous roommates financially strapped craig takes a job as an entry level file clerk at lestercorp located on the th floor of a manhattan building navigating around dr lester orson bean his year old boss and floris mary kay place lester s dotty secretary craig tries to settle into his new position but two things keep him distracted first there s the beautiful and imperious maxine catherine keener who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her and then there s the hole behind the file cabinet which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich where they can experience life from his point of view with enough concentration you can even influence his actions after minutes the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike then things get a little weird by the way if you re concerned that i gave away too much of the plot rest assured i barely scratched the surface one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set up instead he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person s identity he also examines the consequences of the malko visits to craig lotte maxine and of course john malkovich himself the performances are superb malkovich best known to mainstream audiences for his work in dangerous liaisons in the line of fire and as head psychopath in the guilty pleasure con air tweaks his own image in a dandy self deprecating turn far from his effete vaguely reptilian persona this malkovich is just another schlub drinking with his pals and trying to get laid incidentally charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well earned bad boy reputation as always john cusack nails his part handily pulling viewers along even as craig s actions become unconscionable the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz both playing against type kenner usually cast in icy subordinate roles is terrific as a highly intelligent extremely manipulative femme fatale cameron diaz barely recognizable under a mess of brown curly hair sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich being john malkovich stumbles towards the end as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale regardless this contemporary alice in wonderland is a real treat i enjoyed watching being john malkovich but only later after reflecting on the film did its resonance fully hit me at one point craig says do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is truer words were never spoken 
i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success personal growth and insightful humor about life i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard getting some of the latter and not much of the former the basic plot revolves around billy crystal who plays mitch robbins turning forty he s now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original he s given a job at the radio station to his best friend played by daniel stern out of sympathy while stern s character works through his divorce his loser younger brother john lovitz comes to mitch s house to bum a money and place to live all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday during the celebration mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly s the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance old hat after a business trip to las vegas crystal stern and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure on the way they run into curly s twin brother duke played by you know who jack palance first of all the cinematography was beautifully done especially the outdoor scenes in the desert the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself there is some character development during the film the actors remain true to their characters and play them well without overplaying the jokes the movie is a good basic adventure with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict the movie is paced well but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end humor wise the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel surprise surprise for a sequel right however the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film s manipulation of the audience the film tries to pull your heart strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend s butt this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn t worry more about water while tromping around the desert some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey overall i d say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original it may be worth the full price of admission but a matinee would be a better bargain 
carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion made in it still features most of the regulars of this genre sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac hattie jacques re takes her role as matron and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr goode the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard this time williams is after matron jacques when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr goode the doctor hawtrey is sworn to secrecy i assure you that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself there are great cameos from joan sims an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he s at work at the railway station sid james gang including cyril his son kenneth cope try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home he has to share a room with nurse ball barbara windsor and she soon sees through him the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital s pills with panic ensuing there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous matron s williams is as usual on top form but sid james isn t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all the same does not go for charles hawtrey for although he only first appears in the movie after minutes gone and has scarce screen time he seems to steal every scene he is in by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor s talent to full effect the film seems to flounder but it certainly makes up for it with it s good storyline and it s other appealing characters this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored 
there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original one of such masterpieces is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail at least judging by conventional movie making wisdom of its time it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn t been produced on stage screenplay by three writers julius g epstein philip j epstein and howard koch was beeing written as shooting went along the main actors were producers second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz was considered to be capable but not great director however the movie was commercially successful and earned three oscars including the one for the best film until this very day it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in its own golden age the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story in december casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral yet nazi collaborating french vichy government thousands of refugees from war torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas many shady characters thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rains his best friend is rick blaine bogart who used to be idealistic anti fascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody however everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca one of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris the couple needs visas especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail rick is now forced to choose between love wounded pride self preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status bogart s portrayal of rick as complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present was so perfect that his icon would forever be connected with that character another icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old hollywood here in her artistic and visual prime the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking some happier times when the romance on the screen didn t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works for many people casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made but the reason for that isn t the romance itself it s the realistic story of people forced to make tough and often wrong choices in their life the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads the supporting actors also did a marvellous job sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic john huston s maltese falcon yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaves little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed by rick ilsa coupling however rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca captain renault brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime was embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rains managed to make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion to the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary rains also gave another dimension to the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault s relationship towards rick and rick s final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations together with well drawn characters and exciting story the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww movie that is beliavable if not realistic any way even if we don t see it as a historical document casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration 
mickey mouse had better watch his back there s a new critter in town and he s the nameless animal attraction of mouse hunt dreamworks skg s clever first foray into family fare although it runs out of steam towards its end this live action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney s entire non animated kiddie oriented catalog but consider that list includes dismal tripe like air bud flubber and that darn cat and it s really not such a difficult feat to pull off still throw the two rodents in a boxing arena and i ll be hoping that the mouse from mouse hunt knocks some sense back into mickey nathan lane robin williams significant other from the birdcage and lee evans last seen as a nervous bellhop in the fifth element play ernie and lars smuntz befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father william hickey in his last role a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect but there s a lone obstacle in their way a single mouse lives within the walls of the house and he s not about to give up his place of residence without a fight movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite the effects blending the talents of some live mice one animatronic mouse and one computer generated mouse are pretty seamless the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton s mind the smuntz s architecturally unsound mansion is like something straight out of the nightmare before christmas and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price s warped contraptions from edward scissorhands mouse hunt is a pretty dark movie even some of the humor can be grim but it s hardly ever mean spirited the star of the show is neither the top billed lane nor the titular mouse it s lanky british comedian evans whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill note a toned down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease evans banter with the ever affable lane is funny stuff too and holds its own against the movie s more flashy physical shtick vicki lewis beth from newsradio is solid in a supporting role as lars money grubbing wife and in a nifty bit of novelty casting christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a calcium deficiency blech a basically one joke idea a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans is given a rather engaging execution their sparring is imaginatively realized i don t think i ll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda and although you really never fully root for either side that s okay a warm and fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share mouse hunt may take a while to get going the rather lengthy set up could test the patience of some of the younger children although i rather liked it much in part to lane and evans and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable not unlike the original home alone 
do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs do you well as this movie shows us they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring unfortunately there s a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside feeling sorry for ourselves a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing and janeane garafolo s character abby relates to it well like a certain oversized teenage movie critic she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive and the men seem to be backing her up on that meanwhile her gorgeous neighbor nora uma thurman uma being the only woman s name worse than nora attracts men like flies as abby tells her you burp and they think it s cute you barf and they line up to hold your hair back but nora s down on herself for being too shallow and superficial we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby s talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound oh come on any idiot knows how to handle that problem he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person abby though knows her body doesn t match her personality and that she probably won t have a chance with him once he sees her so she gives him nora s body description and stands him up nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful she s not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person but he doesn t suspect anything realizing he s not living in a three s company episode the charade continues with abby furthering the relationship over the phone including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex masturbation sequence and nora furthering it in person while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man like sleepless in seattle this comedy romance is predictable all the way through but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom the truth about cats and dogs isn t quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be but it handles well a theme i could identify with the thing is i find janeane garafolo rather attractive she s no uma but i m sure in real life she d have no problems attracting men i on the other hand couldn t attract a man to save my life and am rather proud of that fact 
those print and television ads trumpeting that grease is still the word are right on the money to celebrate its th anniversary this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like star wars a well deserved red carpet rerelease that s fantastic especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie didi conn being serenaded by her tell it like it is guardian angel frankie avalon or the hard nosed principal eve arden reminding the student body to be an athletic supporter by rooting for the home team or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine edd byrnes flirting with marty a pre empty nest dinah manhoff and these are all probably considered minor moments a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom s most effervescently charming for those eight of you who aren t familiar with the story here s a brief recap greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started but both were wrong sandy tries to rekindle their relationship but danny s too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t bird buddies including jeff conaway so sandy hooks up with a gang herself the pink ladies headed by sassy sexy rizzo stockard channing just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time and danny who still really feels love for her attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back the drag race finale is yet something of a drag and i never have thought much of greased lightening the film s big guy number that choreography ack but grease s flaws amount too few to carp the movie s first showpiece is summer nights where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun in the sun romance not only is nights tremendously catchy but it s also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes there has yet to be a live action musical sequence that rivals the one two punch of you re the one that i want and we go together grease s euphoric cappers all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller quieter moments the oscar nominated hopelessly devoted to you is a lovely showcase for newton john and channing s lamenting ballad there are worse things i could do is one of grease s most unjustly overlooked tunes the soundtrack is remastered though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of nights and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan and scanned out choreography but nothing else has changed no computer generated backgrounds no outtakes or new musical numbers no jabba the hutt cameos and it s a testament to grease s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed it s the same all around blast it s always been with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music to s viewers grease will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo wop and poodle skirts but regardless of what decade it transports us to we can all agree on one thing without a doubt grease is still the word 
this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in whether it was the meddling of studio executives or the work of writer director james cameron himself the original cut of this underwater sci fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed the main problem was fairly simple the film s climax was unworthy of its build up someone at th century fox and no doubt cameron himself must have agreed because in came the theatrical release of the abyss special edition now available on video it seems timely to re evaluate what in its newly revamped state is now a near masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like odyssey two alien and close encounters of third kind the plot is thus we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard nosed lindsay mastrantonio and captained by her soon to be divorced husband bud ed harris the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u s nuclear submarine requiring a dive part way down a three mile deep trench three navy divers arrive to command the operation led by the edgy lieutenant coffey biehn but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they re dealing with as she memorably puts it aren t speaking russian meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and even worse a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u s navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig with the trigger happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings on around them the human drama is often riveting with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron s aliens the stunts hardware special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding and so they should be cameron s technical credentials are well established but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex hubby bud the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis befall them and the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss the abyss special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay a relationship at times touching at others incredibly intense and volatile the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film s end when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war with the inclusion of these startling scenes the story s climax is now given real weight why on earth were they left out of the original this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible so then we have minutes of additional footage that s turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent i say quite because some flaws do remain the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz some new some old that may well have you reaching for the barf bag nonetheless the abyss special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron s greatest achievements alongside aliens and terminator see it and be moved gripped and spellbound 
it must be tough to be a mob boss just ask paul vitti robert deniro a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing i can believe it too one can t even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he s forced to choose between an ice pick baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with suffering from reoccurring panic attacks paul decides he needs to consult some professional help and who better than billy crystal after appearing in bottom of the barrel flops father s day and my giant crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here playing vitti s private shrink the two very different stars strike an unorthodox but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in joke i think placed in this mobster s shoes deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather part ii and casino it s obvious he s having a lot of fun doing so the man behind the camera is harold ramis whose credits include ghostbusters as writer and star and his best directing effort the bill murray vehicle groundhog day ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what s funny and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal s bride to be lisa kudrow playing the same dumbed down role as she does in friends kudrow is amusing but doesn t fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped the supporting cast sparkles joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly vitti s pea brained right hand man and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who s in desperate need of the definition of closure the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout putting the emphasis on or really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides the situation is just too cute to resist it s unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand but hey if you re in the mafia using obscenities probably comes naturally and near the end seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat 
seen february on home video borrowed from chris wessell when it comes to modern gangster movies it s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and or just using the word routine i ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea no matter how many times it s been used before can provide for a good story and donnie brasco clinches this idea it s not unlike most of the great films of the genre yet it never apes another s style as it has a good layer of authenticity even if its core is a tad stale the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late s and the mobsters who inhibit it we meet lefty pacino an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this somehow he comes across donnie brasco depp a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn t afraid of lefty and his rep and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him it s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately telling him all the tricks of the trade i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit however we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone an fbi agent working undercover a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor a brief history of the mob definitions of their slang and where their money comes from and who it goes to the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements however the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works probably from watching other gangster movies and although this attitude comes across the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable thankfully the film doesn t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime and instead opts for character development much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would he s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over years might be we learn of his accomplishments which are quite impressive within their context and when he complains about not being made top boss it s easy to sympathize with him newell constantly plays up this aspect making it a major theme which works well in the long run as donnie is constantly impressing and even one upping lefty it s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed most of the film tells the story of donnie s life in mafia which creates for many sub plots and individual conflicts but doesn t always seem to come together as a whole the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar the resonance to donnie s actual assignment varies he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress but it doesn t always seem to have much meaning back home his wife maggie heche is ready to divorce him because he s never a and the family is suffering since this is based on a true story i wouldn t doubt this would happen although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act or at least any real sense of closure a climax of sorts does occur but there s little feeling of a payoff we get a happy ending which is good but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful aside from a few minor general flaws donnie brasco manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development it may be routine but it s good and that s respectful 
until i saw the night of the hunter it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie forget the others and the deep end which veered toward strained dramatics the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i ve seen so far this year even though the movie is nearly years old and there s a not drop of blood to be seen luckily the night of the hunter charles laughton s first and final directing gig has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re released in october so there s still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place robert mitchum stars as harry powell a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash his newest target is young mother willa harper shelley winters whose murderer husband ben peter graves has hidden somewhere powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs harper after he s released and ben is hanged but finding the money isn t easy for powell who must contend with his stepchildren billy chapin and sally jane bruce who know where the money is but aren t telling the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin no i m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem yes there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter powell s love and hate knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing remember radio raheem and powell s black suit with black tie and white shirt could have shaped quentin tarantino s early visual style seeing the night of the hunter for the first time i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears he s like the senior class president with an evil streak if i ever need to stay awake i ll just picture him crooning leaning leaning any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez who create a series of haunting surreal shadowy images over the rural depression era backdrop it s a testament to both men that they re able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline kids harassed by evil guardians by sticking to the old maxim that we re more scared by what we don t see screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters the drunk birdie james gleason who s haunted by his wife and the spoons evelyn varden and walt spoon whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act the only lapse is the movie s third act when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly bible reading mrs cooper lillian gish her showdown with powell is memorable a battle done with dueling hymns however the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone but it s still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun do yourself favor and don t miss this if it comes to a nearby theater note a series of revealing but overlong outtakes preceded the movie the highlights included the legendary laughton who sounds eerily like mr pitt from seinfeld running winters lines with mitchum and the adorable tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile hours more of such footage exists as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling screened as part of the new york film festival retrospectives feature story coming soon 
it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child whether that may be in life or in death after having said that i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well one gets that choking sensation in the throat because of grief when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement there is no ocean no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ordinary people in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing not that this literally happened in the movie so what are the lessons learnt don t take your children to class reunions don t leave them alone in the lobby not even for a second michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly strung wife and mother a trend that started with a thousand acres and one fine day my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie so much so that when she has a nervous break down the veins on her temples bulge impressively whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance playing a lesbian cop with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop lastly who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie my grandmother comes to mind 
contact is a film that tries to do several different things it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr ellie arroway jodie foster and the religious spokesman palmer joss matthew mcconaughey the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable albeit less immediately engaging than say the cold blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv s the x files the aliens in contact seem to be like us they are more curious than anything else they know we exist they want us to know that they exist and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly and between the characters ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick s a space odyssey most of the film however takes place on earth where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens scientists are enthusiastic ultraconservative religious leaders are wary and government officials are caught somewhere in between the debate is fueled largely by dr arroway s atheism she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind s representative to another species the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches science and faith could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed still the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society the two sides are represented primarily by arroway and by far right fundamentalists but in reality probably of americans are neither atheists nor far right fundamentalists palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less than ideal spokesman for any ideology then again the film does concentrate mostly on public debate which does after all tend to be dominated by extremists rather than on dinner table or college dormitory discussions contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues then but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself the film s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss for one thing it resorts to the tired movie clich that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction the romance rarely if ever sheds any light on the characters although it occasionally tries and fails joss s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement i guess you could say i m a man of the cloth but without the cloth for example is more like a punchline to a joke than character development instead the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments granted this is a plot and idea driven film and the characters are secondary but this just seemed like laziness on the writers part more than anything else the successes of contact however far outweigh its failures even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether which it didn t the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film contact doesn t quite cover all the bases but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two hour film and its rejection of big budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable and i would not be surprised if ten years from now contact is mentioned in the same breath as and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction 
this christmas little ralphie parker peter billingsley wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree although cautioned by many that he will shoot his eye out ralphie remains optimistic conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one a christmas story is a favorite among many during the holiday season and boy it is certainly easy to see why ralphie s endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things a christmas story does so well here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season period detail this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the s with loving detail shepard narrates from a first person point of view divulging his various adventures one snowy december in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head shepard s first hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious but also witty and warm with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing on top of that young billingsley s stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like mom and dad both melinda dillon as mom and darren mcgavin as the old man are perfect in their roles it s hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured for instance he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild mannered young lad peter billingsley has struck quite the chord his performance is richly textured making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment which brings us to the comic situations there are plenty of memorable moments in a christmas story moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing with so much more to explore and to cherish i am particularly partial of the f word scene in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard again shepard s method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry the numerous sequences that stick in one s mind include of course the famous department store santa scene in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree i could go on but i ll finish on this note a christmas story is a standout among holiday movies because it captures so much in a meager minutes not only is it funny it s often genuinely hilarious not to mention warm fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places i plan on making a christmas story a christmas tradition why don t you 
anyone who saw alan rickman s finely realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor turned director is a bit of a poet at heart however for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood prince of thieves this recognition may be something of a shock nevertheless poetic is an excellent term to describe rickman s feature debut as a director the winter guest the film has a simple unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole the result is an occasionally haunting sometimes magical and always insightful human drama the winter guest isn t about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line it s about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure there is no real beginning or end instead we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans they represent both sexes multiple generations and a variety of relationships male and female young middle aged and elderly friends would be lovers and kin we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed emotional boundaries eroded and truths unveiled there is comedy and tragedy most importantly much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives in this fiction can be found much truth the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year it s so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach giving the terrain an alien appearance it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured there are four pairings and although there is some interaction between the different twosomes the winter guest s focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship the first meatiest pairing is that of elspeth phylida law and her recently widowed daughter frances emma thompson these two have a stormy relationship they love each other deeply but both are stubborn and willful and neither is willing to admit that they need the other much of their interaction is argumentative but during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other frances adult son alex gary hollywood is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father on this day he meets a girl nita arlene cockburn who has secretly been spying on him for weeks although their first encounter is antagonistic she throws a snowball at him both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction once they retire to a place where they can be alone however things don t go exactly as planned lily sheila reid and chloe sandra voe are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees death is a topic of endless fascination for them perhaps because they are so close to it and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area it doesn t matter whether or not they knew the deceased it s the ceremony that they re interested in sam douglas murphy and tom sean biggerstaff a pair of schoolboy chums are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach horsing around building a small fire for warmth and walking on the frozen water unlike lily and chloe these two have their entire lives ahead of them they are young enough to still believe in magic but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience the acting is strong and believable the mixture of veteran performers and first timers is effective with the most successful choice being the casting of real life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different non related actors and of course the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child the winter guest began its life as a stage play in with rickman as the director four of the film s principals phylida law arlene cockburn sheila reid and sandra voe appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays the winter guest has been successfully opened up the rough bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans in fact considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman s microscope it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie if you appreciate character studies the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater 
the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king s work this slow moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals but suffers from a tepid conclusion inconsistent direction and may not have wide commercial appeal when the maid dolores claiborne is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer it seems like an open and shut murder case upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax dolores estranged and bitter daughter esquire magazine writer selena st george returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home as the two clash horns the story behind the mysterious death of dolores abusive husband two decades ago ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey is revealed did dolores kill her husband and did she kill her employer dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller consequently it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood s finest character actors such as bates leigh and strathairn kathy bates plays the film s title character and gives a sensational lead performance dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates as her character has a huge amount of screen time she dominates the screen producing a character that is compelling and arresting as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks kathy bates performance is award calibre stuff the rest of the cast is also very good jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour bitter helena st george well and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores ever present nemesis the determined detective john mackey david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores husband joe st george judy parfitt is fine as dolores tyrannic socialite employer vera donovan it would have been interesting to see say meg foster in this role child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences she is very impressive the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right to parts which are embarrassingly hokey the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit and miss in terms of effectiveness the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up however the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful i particularly like the chilling ice blue hue permeating the present day scenes contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw and its pacing may be a turn off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe wielding psychopaths although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion and moves very slowly however the performances are uniformly excellent particularly kathy bates and the film has its moments on my four star scale i give dolores claiborne three stars 
moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era you ve got to know how to allocate your resources every dollar spent on a free agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers in the nfl this leads to teams like the detroit lions who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract but can only field five guys named herb to block for him in the movies you end up with films like spawn with a huge special effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit except that sanders doesn t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages but like the lions star jackie doesn t have anybody to block for him almost every cent that s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts and as chan does his own stunts the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills this leaves about cents to pay for things like directors chan directs scripts and dubbing and supporting characters not to mention the hideous title sequence this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain chan s first release in this country rumble in the bronx was supposedly set in new york but was filmed in vancouver and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible heck jackie doesn t even have enough money for a haircut looks like much less a personal hairstylist in condor chan plays the same character he s always played himself a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen a master of both kung fu and slapstick fu jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert and is chased by a horde of neo nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs one of the things i like about jackie chan movies no political correctness he is joined by three women who have little to do except scream jackie save us and misuse firearms the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere and he s more pathetic than evil en route we have an extended motorcycle chase scene a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel with the neo nazis and two confrontations with savage natives once at the secret desert base there is a long chop socky sequence followed by the film s centerpiece a wind tunnel fight that s even better than the one in face off this is where the money was spent on well choreographed kung fu sequences on giant kevlar hamster balls on smashed up crates of bananas and on scorpions ignore the gaping holes in the plot how exactly if the villain s legs were broken did he escape from the secret nazi base and why didn t he take the key with him don t worry about the production values or what exactly the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara just go see the movie operation condor has pretentions of being a raiders of the lost ark knockoff but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him with a lawrence kazdan screenplay a john williams score spielberg directing and george lucas producing condor might be an a movie however you ve got to go with what you ve got and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special a talent that mainstream hollywood should could and ought to utilize 
trekkies roger nygard s energetic and hilarious documentary brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non fans alike the film generally writes off the trekkies vs trekker polemic as not worth arguing about the good spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable loud giggles yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe denise crosby who played tasha yar on star trek the next generation serves as the host in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary oed the oed cites a february caption in the new yorker as the first recorded usage of the word unless you ve been to the conventions i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans one pointed out apologetically that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams arguably the most famous of all the trekkies she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die hard fans do her claim to fame is that as a juror on the whitewater trial she wore it in court as well every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan like stoicism she says describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession she doesn t quite understand all of the uproar i m an officer of the federation hours a day she reminds us her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith along with the laugher the show evokes there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment few other avocations could give this much satisfaction these people are having the time of their lives for the record i m not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies the film interviews the various star trek series s stars as well as its fans the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade but over twenty years later the conventions are still going strong filled with anecdotes the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions at one the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel after appearing briefly he drank some water and left they decided to auction off his half empty glass joking that it had the q virus the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity not just flitting among people the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies one guy is a trekkie cross dresser another dresses her cat and then there is the dentist the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set he his oral hygienists his receptionist his wife and his kids wear the outfits all of the time it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home but not his family for variety he and his family do change characters from time to time he says his patients like it well there was this one complainer but he had a problem with his bill anyway there are summer schools for klingon with ph d linguists to teach the language hamlet is now available in klingon albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore and they are working on translating the bible they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs even u s customs the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series s larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns sandwiched in between the levity the switch in tone doesn t work the incessantly up beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator he fits right in trekkies runs a breezy it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages 
are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny director writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film next stop wonderland the two main characters alan and erin spend the entire movie in each other s orbit catching glimpses of one another yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life as the film starts erin castleton hope davis a melancholy year old late shift nurse is ending her live in relationship with her boyfriend hoffman rather he is ending it with her arriving home from work erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment car packed with his belongings in a fumbling amusing and self deluding ramble he instructs erin to watch a videotape he s made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he s leaving it s obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief erin s mother holland taylor in a surprisingly effective small role fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life takes out a personal ad for erin to erin s embarrassed horror the ad describes her as a frisky cultured carefree professional with a zest for life eventually erin responds to the tidal wave of responses which makes for some of the most humorous telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and poseurs alan a plumber and aspiring marine biologist first spots erin as he s cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium wearing a wet suit and goggles he follows erin from window to window separated by the glass as erin oblivious to his gaze enjoys the fish later we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside mere feet away the movie spends it s entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing there are several subplots involving alan one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business another subplot involves his father s desperate attempts to force fate s hand by gambling away his life at the dog track a distracting focus is put on alan s debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy thankfully his dream guy persona is counterbalanced by erin s distant yet fundamentally hopeful personality the film moves along at an unhurried pace albeit too much so in the latter third as we wait for the two to meet co writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over when alan and erin eventually do meet we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering almost subliminally knowing gaze it s a sweet measured moment the disappointment comes in the fact that we ve come to know the pair yet we don t get to view their impending romance the film s inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one s life makes next stop wonderland a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions shallow characters and overdone special effects 
playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare s works they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare i mean really who doesn t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare and despite the difficulty of their task they have succeeded shakespeare in love is one of the smartest funniest most touching films of the year it s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors but here we have a movie that defines success it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written it could have been a smug self important movie that panders to die hard shakespeare fans but the appeal of this film is almost universal if you ve ever read a play by shakespeare or know anything about his life it s likely that you ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love joseph fiennes brother of ralph stars as shakespeare himself he s a delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly with women and detached from life s more serious problems debt plague etc he s commissioned to write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann tom wilkinson shakespeare however has trouble focusing on his work he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel this all changes however when he meets viola de lesseps a radiant gwyneth paltrow a young heiress set to marry the financially oriented lord wessex colin firth shakespeare instantly falls in love with her he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo he discovers her identity and confronts her later she of course falls in love with him although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare s writing so much and soon the production which later becomes romeo and juliet is set to be performed shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film not because it works as great entertainment but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role he has such searing optimism and energy he s clearly a man who admires shakespeare and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character inability to turn away from women attention deficit disorder we sense a great deal of affection and care he practically overflows with passion in every scene fiennes is matched by paltrow whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i ve seen her in the two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh of course it doesn t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with stoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor all of his plays have similarly dry humor the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play in the movie shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director i m going to have to see the movie again i m certain there are numerous references that i missed in fact i doubt it s possible to gather everything with just one viewing stoppard is a master of detail you ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film not as lines of a play but as dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time there s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe s mysterious death in a pub there s also a scene featuring a wide eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing there s no dog in this play no no dog the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe wilkinson is also hard to recognize but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously ben affleck playing one of the actors in the company shows great range both in his accent his is almost as good as paltrow s and in humor he has some of the best one liners in the movie colin firth always stuck playing the sap does a good job being hateful judi dench however has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words my single minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end the story is moving but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes but my quibbling is not important what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture the sheer skill with which it has been written acted and produced shakespeare in love tries so many things and nails every one of them it s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him a film in which the actors writers and director are all perfectly in sync it s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare s work in a positive way without seeming condescending or superior i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it 
in may of just years after steven spielberg s success with jaws and years after francis coppolas the godfather a risky ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film in january of this year lucas re released star wars on its th anniversary in this new remastered version the added effects which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer generated jabba the hutt don t do much but call attention to themselves other than these the film is exactly the same why pay to see it in the theaters you might ask simply because when this movie was released most of us were a few years short of being born we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience especially if you haven t seen it the plot is basic but in the same way complex it has many themes but the one rotates around luke skywalker mark hamill and his quest to become a jedi knight his mission begins when a droid named r d plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia carrie fisher which tells him to contact the mysterious obi wan kanoby alec guiness he and kanoby then joined by two inter galactic renegades hans solo harrison ford and chewbacca and skywalker s two droids d and c po the voice of anthony edwards wage war upon the corrupt empire commanded by an evil general peter cushing and the traitorous darth vader the voice of james earl jones skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger the force the film is obviously quite star studded but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones voice would appear so many more times in the future it just happened to work out for him the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker s triumph is symbolized by the audience s sense of becoming something larger than life itself a universe of fans young and old recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever 
 you leave little notes on my pillow i told you a million times i can t stand little notes on my pillow we are all out of corn flakes f u it took me three hours to figure out that f u was felix unger a frustrated oscar madison walter matthau running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger jack lemmon in the odd couple the classic neil simon comedy based on his own stage play about suicidal felix lemmon who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar matthau to stay with him in his apartment after felix s wife throws him out and files for divorce the hook oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way while felix is an obsessive compulsive neat freak the two men despite their friendship instantly clash movies just aren t as delightfully funny as this one is every line of neil simon s dialogue flows like comedic poetry and all the actors are just perfect in their performances lemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix but it s matthau who shines brightest as oscar whose world is being invaded and rearranged mostly against his wishes the type of character i always enjoy identifying with and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti the best thing about the film and this is a testament to the quality of the writing is that it s a comedy with substance these two men even while at each other s throats genuinely care for one another as friends when they clash it isn t cartoonish hatred being displayed but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co exist movies nowadays take grumpy old men for example just don t have that extra spark there these days it s just animosity for the sake of comedy a television series followed starring jack klugman and tony randall which i ll admit i ve never seen an episode of in its entirety and neil simon even scripted the sequel the odd couple ii which was released in neither of them compare to this comic masterpiece though it s one of the best comedies of all time and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films

randy edelman co producers ned dowd jules daly executive producer jackie chan willie chan and solon so produced by roger birnbaum gary barber and jonathan glickman written by alfred gough miles millar directed by tom dey rated pg for mild language adult situations drug use martial art action and violence minutes super mm panavision what can you say about jackie chan that hasn t already been said since the release of rumble in the bronx back in the u s release jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america s video shelves having made over films jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action comedy to the west his latest release shanghai noon is a joyful tribute spoof of the classic western and by adding jackie chan into the genre the tag line for the film the western gets a kick in the pants rings true jackie stars as chon wang a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china the royal princess pei pei lucy liu is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture unwilling to follow her father s wishes princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor decides to escape to america but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong which will lead to the princess kidnapping and ransom unable to take any legal action the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city s bravest guards played by cui ya hi rong guang yu and eric chen are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city nevada chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team as he is looked upon as a buffoon on a train in the u s jackie meets up with bandit roy o bannon owen wilson he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him with his gang in tow roy attempts to rob the train when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court who also happens to be chon wang s uncle chon wang gives chase foiling the attempted robbery but also leaving himself stranded in the desert as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert he again comes upon roy who has been left for dead by his former gang buried up to his neck in the desert roy pleads with chon to dig him out chon demands to know where carson city is roy directs him and chon leaves but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy s mouth and telling him to dig himself chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors a friendly sioux tribe gunslingers a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride brandon merrill before once again running into roy shanghai noon is just good fun the chemistry between the cast is remarkable the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film jackie s performance is as good as anything he s done before he s not called on to do much acting here as the character is not written with any depth but jackie s natural charisma shines through and his comic timing is so perfect both physically and surprise verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on owen wilson last seen in the embarrassing remake of the haunting gives a good natured performance as roy o bannon his innocence is refreshing and fun a bad guy that s not really bad his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant the character is a noble woman of status and wealth but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances nothing here is realistic mind you shanghai noon is first and foremost a light jovial film and the performances match that style with ease the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous using calgary alberta as the prime location mr mindel is able to create a lush romantic western feel to the film nothing here really looks like nevada but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre and as such the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history but with reverence to past films homage to such films as high noon obviously red river and most notably butch cassidy the sundance kid all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film it is a comforting experience at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and dare i say clich s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre this is the purest horse opera since the days of george o brian or john wayne director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood s past in this his first film mr dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see nothing here really stands out or takes one s attention away from the story or action and that is as it should be when jackie chan is your star and what of the action and stunts well while not up to a level of drunken master or any of jackie s hong kong films shanghai noon is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before his timing choreography and creativity are still as sharp as ever jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films obvious to those of us that have seen those films but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar finally jackie can honestly say that he has

what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have i will prefer it to a better made film that is not as thought provoking the thin red line is flawed but it provokes terence malick returns to filmmaking years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war unlike this year s saving private ryan which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof the thin red line simply says war is waste while that might seem obvious to some only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs one message is not necessarily more correct than the other it just depends on one s point of view in malick s film war is set in a tropical paradise and john toll s cinematography is beyond lush the setting poses the question why are we fighting in the face of such beauty in saving private ryan the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go in the thin red line the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place they are just like the americans frightened and angry grieving and praying all that separates them is war the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice overs unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious sometimes corny the voice overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary dispensing with them malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur instead he gets distracting self consciousness aside from that malick s direction is stunning the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary sean penn elias koteas and nick nolte give the best performances penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles ultimately however the thin red line s interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure but malick clearly has different things on his mind has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative what malick is working with is theme and in that the thin red line is most provoking 
no i did not read the novel by thomas hardy jude the obscure his final novel final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again see i did do some research on it about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life but after watching the movie i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is jude is a satirical film from start to finish about society s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system but what s remarkable is how timeless this film is the film takes place in the late th century or early th wasn t really sure but its story could even be retold today in modern form although it d be kinda different a given it tells the story of jude christopher eccleston the psychotic accountant from shallow grave a simple dim witted young man with big dreams in its bleak foreboding opening shot in grainy black and white he gets a lesson from phillotson liam cunningham his teacher as they stand upon a mountain looking upon a city in the distance he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella rachel griffiths because they frolicked in the hay literally but did not ultimately share anything in common he moves away to a town with a giant university with a chance to learn more and get ahead in life taking a welding job he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars reciting latin over and over again and training himself but when he sends his application for the school in he is bluntly told to just remain a worker another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there sue kate winslet his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job for none other than phillotson at the local school there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business nudge nudge several twists turn in the storyline and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business an interesting scene to say the least and are soon born into a controversial non wedlock as she eventually gives birth to their baby and jude inherits his son from arabella who turns up again after awhile because they aren t married and because they re cousins they run into problems with every place they go to carrying around two children everywhere and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time then moving on if you didn t think this was harsh enough wait till you see what happens later on the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world he will never gain any true happiness and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life part of it is his fault he s too optimistic and too gullible but society has a way of taking these people and hurting them until their death the ending of jude is bleak because it has to be although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse guess i ll have to read it now jude offers a satirical view on society s cruelties but shows no way of curing this and thank heavens it doesn t there s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people s minds and that s what jude is sure it s one hell of a downer but it needs to be the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads and some good supporting work along with it christopher eccleston slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression plays jude wonderfully sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face and making him kind of child like at other times kate winslet in a pre titanic performance is brilliant nailing every psyche of her character and creating someone who s troubled but very seductive with her personality kate may be the best actress in her age group if you don t believe me see titanic branagh s hamlet sense and sensibility and heavenly creatures the latter one being my favorite performance of hers in the supporting roles liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher exposing all his bad parts but ultimately being a pretty good person and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude s wife whom he never divorces jude moves at a very slow pace and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists which would drive some people nuts but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films no matter how slow or downright depressing they are this one is both will appreciate jude though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it 
i m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks which is obviously the work of a deranged genius when tim burton s twisted alien invasion comedy really works it s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure and when it doesn t work it s just dull i m not even sure it works more often than it doesn t but where it counts that is when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come mars attacks is brilliant mars attacks is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the s and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer s independence day old alien invasion flicks disaster movies and big budget special effects extravaganzas but unlike independence day which was a painfully middle of the road appeal to the hearts minds and wallets of america mars attacks has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings mars attacks portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are the title sequence is just splendid an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman s thundering theremin driven score is absolutely jaw dropping it s so overwhelming that i swear to you i had trouble breathing the movie lays low for the next minutes we get a glimpse of the alien leader resplendent in a purple sequined cape when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world naturally the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming but mostly the first act is spent developing characters setting up mildly comic situations and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton it s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens because burton s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars anyone who comes to mars attacks expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed with few exceptions these characters are dispatched as the film progresses jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr strangelove s buck turgidson glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house s kennedy room a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big haired pointy breasted sexpot lisa marie the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood in an earlier scene it s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j fox is her newsman husband the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles they blew up congress and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace jim brown and tom jones are the film s vegas based heroes and director barbet schroeder reversal of fortune has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president also on hand and underutilized are annette bening pierce brosnan pam grier lukas haas and natalie portman the latter two also show up in woody allen s everyone says i love you the real stars of course are the computer generated martians and they re fantastic with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull faces round egg eyes with red pupils darting this way and that these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate joe dante s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory but burton s little monsters are more inventive the film s raison d etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault easter island is turned into a bowling alley and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans the sheer level of mayhem is staggering especially when the aliens make their first attack blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg rating it s earned the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day although mars attacks was in production long before that film s release cinematographer peter suschitzky who makes the most of wynn thomas s wildly imaginative production design thomas helped define the spike lee style actually took time off from his mars attacks regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg cronenberg s movie will almost certainly be more somber it won t be released in the u s until early next year but mars attacks is surely a similarly elegant nightmare this is not a nice movie and which studio executive was duped into giving burton million to make it by setting the film s final scenes in the nearly empty holocaust ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided burton s invasion epic suggests that the world we ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead the victims of his invasion are naive greedy or disastrously self absorbed and a good thing too since the movie s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish fulfillment fantasy the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers who triumph by determining that the alien invaders the ultimate elitists are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture ultimately this messy masterpiece is the year s funniest comedy and a weird winking affirmation of the power of the people 
historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early s for many critics scholars and most importantly film producers it was a thing of the past something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black and white television and non cgi special effects but in same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre and same as in the case of dances with wolves he was awarded for his effort with oscars the name of the film was braveheart and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace in his time english king edward i longshanks played by patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by ius primae noctis and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights although english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played by mel gibson doesn t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron played by catherine maccormack murron s death changes that and wallace takes arms and together with small but dedicated band of followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country through time more and more people join his ranks and in wallace s rag tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played by angus macfadyen who wouldn t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson so it wouldn t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann however even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale like vision of picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights in shining armour gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle where hand to hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details never seen since verhoeven s ultra naturalistic flesh blood compared with this naturalistic approach most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays braveheart also employs humour at the right places not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences but also to underline its down to earth atmosphere so different from previous historical epics what makes braveheart larger than life is his protagonist mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and as a result character of th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late th century comic book hero wallace is more than superior to his enemies both physically and mentally yet he is able to show his sensitive more vulnerable side naturally when the character is based on epic poems most of historical accuracy is going down the drain which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in s however even those who don t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel played by sophie marceau and make her a child because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scenes aren t as effective as they should be mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema brendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boorman s general is also very good as wallace s trusted companion as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy stricken king john balliol david o harra is very entertaining as wallace s irish ally and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience stricken character of robert the bruce women in this film have rather thankless roles especially marceau as one dimensional french princess catherine mccormack as wallace s wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early on from the technical point of view the film is also very good photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen on the other hand the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern day instruments for period piece set in medieval times although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism the main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of longshank s son prince edward played by peter hanly he is not only presented as a villain but also as one of the less competent in villain s camp and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct hollywood to make things even more obvious good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals however although the message of this film might look right wing it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in th century according to that ideology oppressed classes workers peasants are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and as such they are more radical less willing to make compromises and more efficient on the other hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety in the end whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre 
 desperate measures was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released summer for some reason it was delayed until hollywood s traditional dumping ground january now that it s out i see no real reason for that delay as it s a simple yet highly entertaining film michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective garcia keaton agrees to the transplant only so he can attempt escape he succeeds in a plan that of course could only work in the movies the police force is now trying to kill keaton while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son the film definately has it s flaws the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status also after keaton s escape garcia s captain barks at him how many men have to die to save your kid s life which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark the thing is it s a vaild point how many people have to be needlessly crippled burned and killed just to save this one child what s the greater good here many lives or one life if movies really had guts nowadays i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia s character place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else alas movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable despite a few silly moments and one or two really stupid ones the good things about desperate measures outnumber the bad the main highlight would be keaton s performance the character could have easily been an overacting scene chewing freak but keaton underplays it nicely he s not as menacing as he was in pacific heights or even as menacing as he was in batman yes kids batman used to be a dark character but you certainly get the idea that he s evil even the final scene of the film which normally i would just hate seems strangely appropriate for this film so much so that i didn t mind it in the slightest and another bonus the film takes place in san francisco which usually means a car chase on those hills that you ve seen a billion times before and for a moment it looked as though it was about to happen but it doesn t and that s creative r 
 run lola run a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance for a berserk and retroactive minutes of non stop movement we follow a fiery haired heroine named lola franka potente as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve marks in time to save manni moritz bleibtreu from being killed by the dealer but in something of a pseudo groundhog day approach director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal in these trio of episodes we gradually learn the unique effects of fate for even if tiny changes are made in lola s journey the future can be seriously altered run lola run is an experience like fight club or the matrix in that each film takes you through a super charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways in addition all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack lola is no exception with stylish quick flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get go tykwer s world is a landscape of mood and color with brilliant shades of red and pink including lola s fiery hair used as effective symbolism throughout with it s visual style and mind blowing pace run lola run is one of the more invigorating movies of the year even more so when considering the fact it s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an minute time period as a heroine potente does little more than run wildly through the streets as the title suggests but she has a certain flair and charisma her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star meanwhile bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life both actors perform beyond the call of duty the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola and the outcome is ultimately rewarding several twists and turns are unique and unexpected the other characters lola runs into both purposely and inadvertently include her banker father herbert kraup and a friendly security guard armin rohde but aside from the two leads no one has more than a few minutes of screen time additional stars that couldn t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy who are both responsible for the film s eye catching visual elegance run lola run is subtitled so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning fast dialogue occasional sections of it are especially fast this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation most are just chess pieces in tykwer s elaborate game of visual presentation and he never really makes a significant move with any but the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay a few petty gripes aside this film is a wild exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality most people believe foreign films are mainly boring talky character studies perhaps run lola run will recharge their batteries not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny it also delivers a white knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character run lola run is exhausting 
 seven is one of the best mystery movies i ve ever seen it s extremely intriguing and suspenseful but it s also quite fun it s a serial killer mystery but you don t care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer the story is a cops on the trail of serial killer mystery someone is murdering people who are offenders of the seven deadly sins a fat man gluttony was forced to eat himself to death a lawyer greed is slaughtered by his own rich possessions i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the good guys which makes the unseen villain seem so vile brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills the cocky rookie however morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset the wise veteran on the verge of retirement and he doesn t get killed by the end there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief this is impressive because the mood is so tense and the fact that it can be down played as well as it is here let alone at all is quite an accomplishment the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil scary place many believe it to be the production design is superb in the spirit of batman and the crow this film embodies the gothic mood the way the words fade in and out along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level even the credits are scary the killer s victims have no connections at all and thus mills and sommerset don t have much to go on to solve the case they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect let s just say it seems a little too mystery movie or too convenient in other words when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe a terrific chase scene ensues this is a typical thrilling element but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story if anything this film is the epitome of twist endings i don t have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal but the way in which this happens is surprising there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives and even though he s obviously insane his charisma makes for some good points what s even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film s resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is seven is not just a film about crime but about the evil within man john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of scum but as justified as he makes himself seem we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice 
more than forty years ago the sword and sandals genre of historical epic ruled the box office during the s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope ben hur cleopatra the robe sparticus the fall of the roman empire quo vadis sometimes brilliant sometimes campy the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood since then epics have appeared infrequently the last emperor braveheart and some of the best have been small screen affairs produced in the s roots shogun yet the phrase we who are about to die salute you has been absent until now gladiator begins in germania in a d roman general maximus russell crowe has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius richard harris and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting however the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus joaquin phoenix will prove a poor successor so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again when commodus hears the plan he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered maximus escapes from the executioners but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus place is never explained an african named juba djimon hounsou treats maximus wounds proximo oliver reed a gladiator who won his freedom purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena of course maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier and his fame spreads when commodus reopens the coliseum proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus sister lucilla connie nielsen the similarities to braveheart are obvious an evil king a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family the aid of a lovestruck princess also like mel gibson s epic gladiator has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero s anger it s a simple tale of good versus evil maximus has all the manly virtues nobility of purpose courage in battle loyalty to king and country physical stamina and devotion to family commodus is his opposite in every way a sniveling selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience the opening night crowd in my theater was about male and that seems appropriate gladiator is a guy movie would the opposite of a chick flick be a dick flick there s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences those easily offended by gore should stay away lucilla is the only female character and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance in the scene where commodus kills his father phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father s love or pride throughout the picture phoenix manages to give depth to a character who s scripted as a caricature of evil i ve been a russell crowe fan since romper stomper this role doesn t offer him the complexities of his parts in l a confidential and the insider essentially his job is to grunt heroically but his voice which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp is perfect for the genre the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar my only major quibble with gladiator is its stylized look several scenes are tinted we ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately particularly in payback and the matrix i don t get the appeal of the style which makes feature films look like tv ads in payback it was merely annoying but in gladiator it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d etre of the roman epic perhaps it s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer generated shots also the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books leaving a half blurred trail of images of himself behind with a more realistic look gladiator could be even more satisfying than braveheart because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion bottom line a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices 
the happy bastard s quick movie review me tarzan you happy viewer for a minute there i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney s latest another adaptation of a legend from the past remember the pathetic pocahontas yikes but guess what disney a company that s been on a roll lately with animated films strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you the story is pretty basic tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who s lost her young adopts him into her group as he matures into a much older man tarzan still wonders just why he s so much different from the clan and then arrives a hunter a professor and the professor s lovely daughter jane who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons from there tarzan faces tough choices should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england the voicework here is pretty top level tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already beautiful jane nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice rosie o donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan s best ape friend terk and wayne newman knight has his moments as a panicky elephant the movie is superb throughout mixing a great script with incredible computer assisted visuals when tarzan tree surfs a twist that was added on top of the same ol vine swinging and a great one i might add the camera twists and turns allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly i couldn t believe my eyes disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast and the music s not half bad either fortunately there s no ridiculous singing characters here just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood there s some great action sequences here as well including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan jane and the aforementioned babboons but of course it s not all action there s a message here as well that has to do with family this is easily one of disney s best animated films of the decade and it s one i can t wait to put in my home library that is if my vcr still works in the year 
alien is the only alien film i have seen in theaters i saw it when i was years old and i must admit that i didn t like it of course i was expecting aliens again and i believe this was my fault in order to appreciate alien you need to see aliens but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor james cameron s aliens was an action film and many people consider it the best in the series i am among that group but alien is an extremely entertaining film which critics have bashed for its originality many thought the final chase scene went on for too long and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action both are untrue because the film has quite a bit of action and the dialogue was essential and well written as for the chase sequence it was long but not overly long creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion perhaps watching alien on video helped on the big screen i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn t see it was a very dark film and the language was extremely harsh i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities don t get me wrong i m not saying films should eliminate swearing but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks it gets rather distracting however since seeing it again i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters as a result alien s only flaw albeit a major one is the underdeveloped characters we never really care about any of them and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie there were only two characters i liked and of course one was lt ripley sigourney weaver although we have gotten to know her through two other films the other character was dr clemens charles dance but because we like him the inevitable occurs alien begins exactly where aliens left off the prologue of alien is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry without using a single line of dialogue unless you count computer warnings fincher sets up the entire film an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card we see lt ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments title a shot of an alien egg title alien legs stretch up into the air title and so on and so on during these first ten minutes i learned everything i had to in order for alien to proceed it s quite a remarkable opening and one which will remain in my mind for a long time because of this face hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod and sent down to the nearest planet fiorina fury an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison however the face hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo tubes and is sent down with the escape pod unfortunately during the landing all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery of course you need a carrier for this face hugger and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates ripley is revived and asks to see the ship after seeing a mysterious acid eaten section ripley asks to see the dead bodies and then have them cremated this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films featuring a monologue from dillon charles s dutton a prisoner who has found god the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog s demise it s one of the most memorable moments as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog and this is where alien succeeds fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock in fact he is the mixture of both fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films alien is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images by doing so fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise many people have criticized fincher s filming of the death scene of ripley i reveal nothing by saying this as looking too fake but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron a great deal of symbolism is derived i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron however most people seem to want to witness ripley die which creates a paradox as she is the character i didn t want to see die why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film and i don t plan on spoiling that in this review from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever in alien it was of course the moment the alien burst out of kane s stomach in aliens it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine alien has several but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley ripley is pushed up against a wall and the alien stands inches away from her why it doesn t kill her is a shocker which later leads to a surprise ending fincher apparently loves to use close ups of actors faces michael douglas and the clown face off in the game in the same style and by shaving off the actors hair the only thing we have to look at is their faces many critics didn t like all the actors being bald but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot most of alien works when you take it in context of the story but when you try to compare it to its predecessors fincher s turn seems a bit gloomy and dark though that s not always a bad thing the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films with some major twists again we are setup with several different characters and one by one they are picked off however while the first two had tons of arsenal especially cameron s film alien takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run down prison as a result no weapons are to be found this creates a lot of tension although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense as an alien film alien is the worst of the series but by itself it is an extremely well made motion picture with a lot more merits than not the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one dimensional characters i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about despite this ripley was the central figure and that s what is important we care for her even though she began to act just like one of the guys again the technical side of this film is remarkable and better than the two previous versions while cameron s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting and moody sets the cinematography by alex thomson is very well done with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around the yellows reds and oranges of the lights create a dark mood and by themselves create a lot of suspense shadows dance on the walls and yet those shadows could easily be the alien the alien is different from its predecessors this time around and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien racing after the characters the sets are quite incredible which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed the sets appear to be in the future but not too far in the future one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien nothing surprising there sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens she was snubbed at the oscars for this one mainly because the film was a critical bomb her reactions are far more realistic in this film with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter it s quite touching really charles s dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates and i was on the brink of actually caring for him charles dance turns in a nice low key performance and as a result i cared for him immediately lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii but he was more entertaining in aliens the rest of the cast is pretty stale though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world alien is rated r for strong violence and language and sex although it has its flaws alien is highly entertaining with rich symbolism this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out it s a film like fincher s which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity the final scene in fact it tells us that we as a society have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little fake whenever something looks fake on screen we immediately point it out as a mistake but perhaps it isn t a mistake 
martin scorsese s films used to intimidate me because of his reputation i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks as much as i enjoyed them i usually felt like i missed something i learned from scorsese s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies for example in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on or toward the end when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building again the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing i don t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good looking but he simply uses the best tool for the job it shouldn t have surprised me then that kundun a film about a mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward the movie follows the life of the th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet the movie s title is another name for the dalai lama which means ocean of wisdom his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story one of which makes an interesting statement pay attention to the film s opening shot and watch where it is repeated we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old his curiosity and self assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the dalai lamas who have gone before several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own the boy picks correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama scorsese and long time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made a second choice either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise perceptive leader from this point on the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama s spirit and the future leader of a nation it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child in the u s it might be grounds for a call to social services but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable well rounded person certain patterns take shape over the years for example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology radios clocks and telescopes are some of his favorite toys when he is old enough to accept his leadership he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain including herd animals it s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet s gigantic neighbor china tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china as first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the armies come across their common border the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama s life is in danger if he stays the movie ends when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaves tibet for india the story doesn t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do it just doesn t fit that mold if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie perhaps more like seven years in tibet which is good in its own right the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events not vice versa perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestments and architecture of tibet a mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold the bricks are a rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie which is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet philip glass composed the music for kundun and he was the perfect choice for those who don t know of glass his music is like a tibetan mandala his building blocks are lots of small notes tiny grains of music which are first grouped then repeated in patterns these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition people won t be flocking to kundun for it s great ending or talking about its outstanding plot but it does have a lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sights rich cinematography and innovative music it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who gives the film a strong beautiful consistent look

taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers the story centres around a group of people who include brit simon askew and checkout girls claire holmes and ronna polley and the misadventures that they get into split into three chapters everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers although qt s touch is evident in nearly every frame go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride liman who also photographed the film has a deft touch with the camera and the film looks good the film also seems to have benefited from a budget with the night club scenes in particular looking pretty good there s a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life holmes one of the dawson s creek cast a show i m not particularly fond of displays much talent here and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature askew is slightly successful being rather obnoxious no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him but instead of funny annoying he s just annoying he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer who gives an nice evil performance the script written john august is sharp and witty with good dialogue and some funny jokes it starts off rather slow however but in about twenty minutes the script has found it s footing and just keeps getting better the stories are largely satisfying although occasionally there s too much attention on one detail but not on another also some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky still the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it it could of tried a little harder in some parts however and these parts lag because this is a gen xer movie the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany and go s one is pretty decent unlike other gen xers movies go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue which is a plus go is a very easy movie to absorb into and the audience really starts feeling for these characters thankfully they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics like the heroine in things i hate about you they are who they are and they stay that way go is great fun and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride erm go to go i guess 
labelling is sometimes everything in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors producers weren t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones on the other hand producers were right on the mark walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america to make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based on anabasis historical book written by xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia years ago instead of ancient persia movie begins in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warriors local youth gang gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city the gathering organised by gramercy park riffs most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx that is far away from warriors home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce on the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riffs announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city crowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogues led by psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus police simultaneously raids the gathering and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing and their leader gets killed by riffs the remaining eight led by cleon s lieutenant swann michael beck must now try to get to coney island but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs upon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status however despite being one of the best movies of that year and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly if walter hill s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america he failed miserably the future was much worse than his vision the youth gangs as presented in the warriors are far from shadowy armies able to take over entire cities their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime in their vocabulary word arms is reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns they even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour despite those objections the warriors have all the elements of a very good film the plot is simple and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there isn t much bloodshed or gore in the movie editing is superb events happen at quick pace with the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would be girlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable yet the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity best known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains michael beck as cool almost statesman like leader of a gang is also very good and james remar gives good contrast as his hot shot contender for top spot all in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies

the story of us a rob reiner film is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films well has two of them the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family american beauty the story of us a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family is a well written heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience including myself cry the story of us tells the story of ben bruce willis and katie michelle pfeiffer jordan and asks the question can a marriage survive years of marriage the film is about two individuals who have come together spent a good chunk of their lives together and shows when our main characters are him and her during the bad times and when they are us during the good times the story of us is about their entire years of marriage that is collapsing day by day ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer or at least say they don t love each other anymore ben a cartoonist and katie a crossword puzzle writer have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage as they have grown to follow different views on life family and marriage katie is the more organized sophisticated type who wants to plan everything out while ben is a spontaneous adventurous individual who doesn t mind doing things differently than they were planned the story of us plays out nicely as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist told to the viewer through flashbacks as the film progresses it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage this method is highly effective as we see the characters changing from year to year slowly growing apart through the flashbacks we get to see the story of them through both of the character s eyes and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like as the story of us has three dimensional believable main characters the screenplay written by jessie nelson stepmom and alan zweibel dragnet is a touching down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer much like another one of nelson s films stepmom the script has an open honesty and outlook on life one that is so realistic you feel uncomfortable at many times because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar as most families these days most go through the hard times as ben and katie must if it wasn t for the first minutes that the writers wrote which are rugged and certainly flawed the story of us would have been this year s best picture bruce willis a usual action adventure star has certainly turned himself around in the past year he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies to a distinguished sophisticated actor as in last summer s the sixth sense and now in the story of us willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script although i wouldn t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan willis handles himself nicely and shines in a few of the film s most powerful scenes enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season where to start about michelle pfeiffer pfeiffer s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion you wonder how how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism pfeiffer s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring will be in the heart s of any viewer that has watched this moving film the story of us is one of s most real yet funny films as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked superb acting direction writing story and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman make the story of us a touching unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall the film s major high points are the fights between ben and katie as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed and although they also say things like it s over or i hate you you can tell the two still share a deep connection and that inside somewhere they are still an us the bottom line a wonderful enchanting and heartbreaking film one of the most realistic heartbreaking films in recent years

sick the life and death of bob flanagan supermasochist by fernando vallejo starring bob flanagan and sheree rose interviews by kathe burkhart kirby dick and rita valencia produced and directed by kirby dick running time mins this film is not rated the central themes of sick the life and death of bob flanagan supermasochist are pain and love and its subsequent effect on a person s life its protagonist bob flanagan who died at the age of suffered from cystic fibrosis a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus preventing him from normal breathing the movie is about much more than recouperating or attempting to from this disease an audacious fabulously triumphant docudrama sick chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of years sheree rose who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film flanagan s idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental similar to terry zwigoff s brilliant crumb which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait but a realistic one both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age courageously defying god he was an irish catholic and turning his body into a work of art which he unraveled in museums and lectures behold these works of physical art among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus and the most disturbing scene of the decade nailing his penis to a board flanagan was a man of great intelligence wit and humor as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking not only did he approach his disease with humor peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience he was also revitalized by his approachment most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties there s also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her but the most outstanding thing about sick is flanagan s relationship with sheree brimming with honesty sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain their powerful bond lifts sick into a rare cinematic high where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people the last scene where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed as he struggles for his last moments of life is raw tender hideous it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy 
andrew lloyd webber s musicals preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as oklahoma or the slapstickness of shows like a funny thing happened on the way to the forum they instead tackle hot issues from our past and view them differently and pack them together with redundant catchy music as well as thoughtful lyrics like jesus christ superstar which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective in the cool tune superstar a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn t spread his message wider evita takes an inventive stance on its topic this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator juan per n eva who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention much like the woman playing her madonna although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent among other things evita deals with the rise and fall of eva per n a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan jonathan pryce then died at the young age of creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di the two do share a bit in common although it wasn t like di slept to the top webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals but they always have a point for doing it here they wish to expose her for what she is but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks her lying and covering up for her fascist husband but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions and her death was very sad it s also a musical with almost no words not unsung the film plays like a rock opera much like their jesus christ superstar with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience but also a very entertaining one after all this is a musical and webber s musicals never undermine this they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth walking on a fine line between the both and never stumbling on either side this is why the beginning of evita is kind of a let down okay it is a let down i m not saying the opening moments are bad because they re pretty good but what comes after is a lifeless un entertaining and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer jimmy nail into taking eva to buenos aires after a one night stand in the musical it s a fun energetic sequence culiminating in the show stopper buenos aires which is also lifeless then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer instead of her leaving him where she ends up singing the sad tune another suitcase in another hall which was meant for a later character screwed over by eva the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft seeming like parker and oliver stone who adapted it for the screen are afraid to present her for what she is even while it s being narrated by a hater of eva s the omnipotent antonio banderas who presents her in a negative light for a while it looks like alan parker can t pull it off however the film pulls itself together in a flash and after that song is over and the giddily nihilistic song goodbye and thank you where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend is magnificent darkly comical and just gleeful from this point on the film is hypnotic satisfying and satirical no more punches are thrown and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact we see eva woo and marry juan get him out of jail rise to stardom falter a bit come back and then gradually die of cancer i think it was because of cancer more importantly many of the themes from the musical carry on with this as well as some filling in the gaps reconnassaince work juan who is pretty underwritten in the musical is given some extra scenes and exposed as what he was for eva an accessory a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan and understand his sadness more than we did before from the goodbye and thank you number on the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation and saved a government even while it left the nation s people downtrodden but despite this the nation still loved eva and when she slipped into death the world mourned her because she was a star that s when our narrator ch comes out to show that she wasn t the great woman she really was and expose her fame describing this character is difficult mainly because he has no real realistic background he s said to be based on the revolutionary ch guevera but the two probably could have never met like they do in the film but he serves as a perspective on eva but even his perspective can t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death alan parker no stranger to bizarre musicals he s done fame the committments bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall the latter which is absolutely brilliant nails the film exposing everything for what it is we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should by the way it is presented his direction is manipulative for a reason to show the mourning for what it is and there is energy throughout with lots of bright colors and scenes which are cinematically entertaning as well as enriching and deep such as the balcony scene where she sings don t cry for me argentina and her death sequence which is poignant becuase of how sad it is madonna s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly remaning there for the rest of the film at the beginning she looks like she s too busy concentrating on her singing to act but she eventually gets it right though never really getting the presence of say patti lupone who did the role in its american premiere back in the late s her death though is brilliant her singing could be better though i know she took lessons to improve her range and all but it still sounds like she s trying to hard she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding like patti lupone i heard her sing on an old evita cd and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her but it s generally very good although not up to the brilliance the role really requires antonio banderas who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days i m one of the few people who thinks he rocks is extremely comanding in his performance presenting a lovable narrator his singing is very good though nothing compared to the original mandy patinkin he does have a pretty good singing voice and a great range and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome although very brief at times in his role as juan seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade although it gets off to a rocky start rocky s polite for what it really is it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical like the other musical released in woody allen s everyone says i love you it s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance

some critics including siskel ebert are on the record stating that martin scorsese s raging bull the story of boxer jake la motta is the best film of the s since there are still a number of s films that i haven t seen i don t feel qualified to make such a judgment but i ll say this without hesitation raging bull is a great motion picture and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january and december come close to its level bio pics often fall into one of two categories overblown hero worship or a dry dull textbook account it s rare that a movie with the moniker based on the life of comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining raging bull is the perfect counterexample and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta a middleweight icon from the s and s and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen for all minutes director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro in the title role have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic sad and horrifying historically raging bull is said to be mostly accurately with the lion s share of the details culled from la motta s own autobiography which was co written with joseph carter and peter savage however although la motta is credited as the movie s consultant he was reportedly unhappy with the final result because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth insensitive lout the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base bestial impulses paranoia jealousy and blind rage sex and violence are inextricably linked the title is apt la motta is a raging bull in the ring he is a terror not just beating his opponents but destroying them outside of it he is no less vicious or more easily controlled the two people who spar with him on life s canvas are his wife vicki cathy moriarty and his brother manager joey joe pesci these are the two who mean the most to jake and who as a result of his inability to trust himself or others he loses he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity and when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him his lets loose with an explosion of violence raging bull opens in when la motta an up and coming fighter is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class over the years he wins several key bouts including one against his arch rival sugar ray robinson johnny barnes but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match meanwhile away from the ring la motta falls in love with year old vicki who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife vicki becomes jake s greatest prize a wife in his view is not a companion but a possession and the source of his most extreme pain his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him hence he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else perhaps even his brother this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere are you f king my wife in the late s la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight but with one huge condition he must take a fall he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing two years later he wins the championship only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray by the late s and early s when the film ends jake has become a pathetic figure a broke overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor has lost his wife and children and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine raging bull is the other side of rocky sylvester stallone s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in it won the best picture oscar and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production but where rocky romanticizes boxing raging bull takes a cold unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring while scorsese s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man he never backs away from showing the seedy ugly underside of a sport where gambling greed and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working rocky shows boxing at its noblest raging bull shows it at its most diseased there s little i can say here that hasn t already said about de niro s performance in a career that has included many fine roles this is his most outstanding the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering and although there s a lot of travis bickle de niro s character in taxi driver in la motta scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that if we never fully sympathize with him at least we understand the forces that drive him this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting as the younger jake de niro is trim and fit as the fat older man de niro gained pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form how many actors would go that far the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work although neither won their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro s pesci who has basically re created the same personality in two other scorsese films goodfellas and casino presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother the misogyny and violence are still there only better concealed but when joey snaps as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster frank vincent it s startling to behold moriarty on the other hand must play the temptress with virginal qualities the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake later she s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black and white a few home movie segments are in color the choice is perfect for the movie giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black and white approach is almost unheard of one important recent exception schindler s list eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did in black and white especially considering scorsese s choice of shots and use of slow motion the violence is stark and disturbing there s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas during fight sequences the director also uses a number of point of view shots designed to show the world however briefly from la motta s perspective scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta s loss to sugar ray where he surrendered his middleweight crown after that his career was all downhill yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment stretching more than a decade into la motta s future the reason is obvious scorsese isn t as interested in boxing as he is in the character following his retirement la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando s speech from on the waterfront i coulda been a contenda perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the s and if not it s certainly perilously close to the zenith 
it s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts but that s just what happened to me at uhf weird al yankovic s big screen debut uhf is a television parody a la airplane and like airplane the movie is extraordinarily stupid but it s dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb it s so silly and outrageous it s hilarious the movie stars weird al as george newman a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination the type who fantasizes he s indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns george is basically a loser his daydreams and smart alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station george revives channel with innovative programming shows like wheel of fish and movies like conan the librarian as the station s ratings rise it comes into competition with channel the leading vhf network affiliate as r j fletcher channel s ill natured hard nosed owner veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy he really hams it up with his snorts grimaces and scowls uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television including game shows tabloid talk shows children s shows dizzy news women and movies everything from rambo to close encounters the funniest scene the one that made my head spin is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed like most movies in its genre uhf is hit or miss for every gag that works at least one fizzles for instance weird al s mock video of money for nothing by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt although it does have some nifty computer animation but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail we know another gut wrencher is on the way in fact uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane type movie since well since airplane much of the credit goes to weird al s exceptionally inventive script and to the movie s winsome cast weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning but because he s not afraid to look silly he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character the real standout is michael richards as stanley the dim witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children s show stanley spadowski s playhouse stanley s off beat mixed up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over night star he is an endearing mixture of good natured innocence high energy enthusiasm and puppy dog cuteness and above all he s a good janitor who adores his work another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips the cast also features gedde watanabe the chinese foreign exchange student in sixteen candles as the karate master who hosts the hit series wheel of fish also aboard for the ride is fran drescher who plays pamela finklestein channel s roving reporter unfortunately as weird al s girlfriend victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering whining and sulking her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether while uhf is not an absolute must see it s definitely the ticket if you re looking for a wild and zany whacked out comedy the movie is good enough to see in the theaters but it may work even better on television the very medium at which it pokes fun

zero effect gets its title from the main character daryl zero bill pullman although we don t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film zero is a private investigator perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived at least he d like to think so however he s a socially inept being and eccentric in every possible way this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are zero s accomplice is steve arlo ben stiller a normal guy who does the business side of the job he s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero s greatness as an investigator the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero s talents to soon to be client gregory stark ryan o neal it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about zero takes the case and the plot thickens his path leads to a young pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan kim dickens despite her luminous and seemingly harmless presence she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark through his investigations zero learns why but not without developing feelings for gloria feelings that because of his reclusive behavior are new and confusing to him i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators and every once in a while a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away actually no private eye film has ever reached chinatown s greatness zero effect which is jake kasdan s first effort as writer director is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts it s an original funny and completely involving motion picture with so many cliches available to this genre i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them but he didn t just successfully avoid flaws he has created a great film here one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment take for starters the great cast of characters pullman is terrific as zero showing a comic flair that i really haven t seen from him since spaceballs zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here the fact that he s an almost exaggeratedly twisted emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe pullman s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance and the occasional voice over as he s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious ben stiller is also a very funny individual he s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny i ll shoot you he says to stark at one point i have a gun and everything his character is also well drawn with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend angela featherstone who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job o neal also gives his character a bit of depth and kim dickens last seen and underused in mercury rising gets a chance to show us her talent here giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film kasdan s humor is of the best kind soft spoken and mostly dialogue driven though there are some great visual jokes it s the kind of humor that s funny even after you ve seen it five or six times there s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is an how that makes him such a great detective what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed or standing motionlessly with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face his eyes pointing to something off camera but obviously to nothing in particular i can t convey to you how funny this is but what makes it great film making is that it has a point scenes like this are frequent and they provide solid characterization of zero as a side note i don t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy not to sound elitist i find things funny that many do not and vice versa there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it i have a feeling the humor here won t appeal to everyone but there s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone s interest jake kasdan son of writer director lawrence kasdan is only years old i found this out after seeing the film and i can t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker his direction is stylish without being pretentious and his writing is mature full and developed zero effect is the kind of film that i ll buy for my collection smart original films like this are rare as it is but this one actually has a heart and a soul at the end of the film i was involved in the characters and i was satisfied with the outcome and with kasdan s undeniable talent at such a young age all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future 
the seasoned capt dudley smith james cromwell questions his new protege ed exley guy pearce about his political views when it comes to police work would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you knew the person to be guilty would you shoot a man in the back if you knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved exley squeaky clean innocent and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed no stunned smith pleads then for the love of god don t be a detective la confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the s organized crime was the biggest concern corruption existed everywhere and every cop had his own way of getting the job done there was hollywood jack vincennes kevin spacey who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell all show all tabloid sid hudgeons danny devito sporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat he isn t afraid to flash his tinseltown style detective bud white russell crowe has only a narrow minded view of the law and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice and then there is golden boy exley wide eyed and ambitious but extremely naive a horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth action and personal vindication almost immediately an arrest is made but something doesn t seem quite right new developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department suspicion and questions begin to mount odd alliances are created and as layers of the truth become revealed the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment when the mystery expands we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops including a high priced hooker kim basinger and a shady millionaire david strathairn all of the characters levels of involvement are not immediately clear we watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case we sense a cross pollination of clues that brings us the audience closer to the truth we hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery absorbing and affecting this movie has all the necessary ingredients to create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir it boasts mysterious figures in control double crosses hard information from sleazy sources dirty politicians corrupt cops haunting women and hard nosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity the underlying mystery is compelling the look and feel of the movie is gorgeous the entire cast is crisp and wonderful to watch i wouldn t be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance and the dialogue is rich and memorable the best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do don t start trying to do the right thing boy o says he you haven t had the practice l a confidential triumphantly achieves the rare gift of complexity and coherence while satisfying our desire for a good old fashioned movie 
being the self proclaimed professional film critic that i am i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia coming soon to dvd until only recently after all it s considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai and doctor zhivago so one day a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it i was initially skeptical that something made almost years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt numbing hours of its duration but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against the winner of seven academy awards in for best picture director editing cinematography art direction music and sound after watching the film again i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t e lawrence during world war i lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence played by then unknown actor peter o toole as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i shot in panavision s famed super mm format the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic it is absolutely breathtaking using stunning cinematography costuming and direction shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in and watch this story unfold before my eyes every shot is choreographed as a portrait a living tribute to a great land david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time a far cry from its pathetic uncreative existence today after watching the film the first thing that came to my mind was i ve got to do a remake of this film but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern day movie executive okay it s going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert we are going to need to blow up a full size train because computer generated effects probably wont do it justice and we are not going to use any big stars and won t have any female actors since there s no love story yes my friends the velvet curtain fell on the golden era of hollywood a long time ago but at least we still have the proof to show all would be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be 
 the celebration is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant you know where you sit down to watch it and no matter what you ve heard about it before you just can t help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like i don t really feel there are to be any real rules for cinema a film can do anything as long as it makes it work but i do ask that all films have one thing in common they create experiences when i watch a film no matter what kind of film it is i want to be able to take certain memories along with me the celebration is great because it s chock full of those it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial just to make sure you re paying attention which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored then you re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning up the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch henning mortizen who has just turned and is having a party thrown for him all his friends and family turn up and for the first half hour we get introduced to everyone simplistically and realistically no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here the eldest son christian ulrich thomsen looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell is the first to be seen in the film walking to his father s home his brother michael thomas bo larsen drives by pulls over greets him then kicks his family out of the car forcing them to walk to the estate just so christian can be comfortable we then meet helene paprika steen their sister a woman who always seems to be stressed out who invites the driver of her car gbatokai dakinah an american to to come join her at the party she s going to once they re all there and settled in the party begins and as custom the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad so christian stands up at the head of the table and reveals the film s punchline his father raped all his children at a young age but since this is a family friends affair his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth and is simply brushed off despite his efforts and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir and it s all terribly interesting to watch twists occur and soon the film has taken on a nearly farsical nature but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends the most notorious thing about this film which has been getting the most notice though is that the director thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion as a member of the danish filmmakers clan dogme a group that has vowed to oppose the auteur concept make up illusions and dramaturgical predictability so that they may purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot i have not seen breaking the waves the other notable film by a member of this group lars von trier to be exact but the celebration works exquisitely in this department it feels like reality like you re actually watching real people and not actors and as a major pointer has been shot on video as a result it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film but always wanted to we see key moments in people s lives that they wouldn t dare show to the world and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style as ironically showmanship as it really is works perfectly for the nature of the film the key though to this film and the reason it s not just a cool danish import is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth throughout the film we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies a debate so three dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the truth at all costs reasoning out of the water of course it was not right for the father to rape his children and of course they couldn t have fought back then and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them and yes it s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier but then again the father after all is not a totally bad guy and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he s done and deep down feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface the final scene involving mortizen and everyone else is utterly devastating thanks to him and thomsen whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex everyone else is flawless as well the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays exactly like life as such the celebration may be the one truly bizarro film of the year a work of art so eerily close to reality that it s utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating 
in a flashback the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film the hanging garden tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance horrified the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows the rule of if you don t break off a kiss by the count of then you committed a sin with the boy and most of all the grandmother wants to know if she has protection she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture that moniker misses the mark yes every member of the household has their own special problems but the writer didn t choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident this delightful little picture mixes love tragedy and pathos resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction during the opening credits we observe the boy sweet william at the center of the story first he s an average sized young lad who is slapped off screen by his father next he s pound teenager played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte when the opening credits end we cut to years later william is now an average sized reasonably happy adult played with love and compassion by chris leavins william has returned after years absence to attend the marriage of his free spirited and foul mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover fletcher joe s keller kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy nicole burnell who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter plays the teenage rosemary the father of the family whiskey mac peter macneill is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful his wife iris seana mckenna says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine year old violet the sister whom william meets for the first time as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home william wanders off to try on one of his old coats which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways he takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways rosmary s trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath all while talking to her brother as much as anything the film is a series of character sketches in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter a homosexual one although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex his mother is aghast a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife dusty miller martha irving who for a fee will have heterosexual sex with william with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational dusty after asking iris to watch her daughter takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex all of this notwithstanding he still prefers males the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face to face with himself when younger this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited in the most devastating he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself even here the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker the ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot the hanging garden runs it is rated r for strong sexuality language violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature 
a sci fi comedy starring jack nicholson pierce brosnan annette benning glenn close martin short and other stars a warner bros picture the martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie before entering the cinema i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish and there was no point to it all how wrong they were i left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the cinema the story is about martians attacking earth using ray guns hooray they generally cause havoc around the u s and other countries nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion and also taking advice from his loopy officials but basically its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth the way people are killed by the ray guns is great they is a hillarous and mildly disturbing scene involving a martian lady a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding but most of all this film is fun the martians are full of character the performances are spot on and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable the film is a million times better then the dire independance day and is a real tribute to the tacky s invasion movies they are is a great score by danny elfman and lots of laughs this has to be the best invasion i ve seen for a long time 
if he doesn t watch out mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max of course there are still a few big guns in this film but there s some accomplished acting too although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti hero skin as his career progresses here he explores a new genre the businessman as action hero in ron howard s latest film gibson plays tom mullen a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation a veteran of numerous hard nosed business negotiations the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive he has to play his hand differently the casting is what puts this film over the top the trio of gibson the kidnappers mastermind gary sinise and fbi team leader delroy lindo play off of each other wonderfully sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h g wells morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of society mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below feeding off the unsuspecting gibson s character is an all american hero with a few flaws his cowboy tactics tend to work but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with in a round about way if he weren t known as a man who i s willing to buy his way out of trouble his son wouldn t have been kidnapped as sinise says you re a payer you did it once and now you re going to do it again one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities lindo calls home to talk to his kids obviously shaken at working this case even the kidnappers are real people arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars gibson s break down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective it s one of the best filmed representations of a man s world falling apart that i ve seen it s not all perfect the shoot em upending while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution as well crafted as the scene is we ve seen it before mullen s wife rene russo has several good moments but occasionally just seems to be there while adequate brawley nolte sean doesn t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around but you ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one forget about the large coke you won t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later

 from the commercials this looks like a mild mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end the concept is deceptively pedestrian an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents following one dead end lead after another each funnier than the previous they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents alan alda and lily tomlin it s difficult to condense the mile a minute plot seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one without giving too much away one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion and it s all done in a fairly clean almost well maybe not exactly family fare manner a grand cast tomlin alda moore ben stiller patricia arquette tea leoni george segal interacts in a seamless parade of laughs drawing from a more hyper woody allen style the film succeeds beyond expectations 
one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel that concept although many purists doubt its scientific credentials spawned many interesting novels comic books and films in the last century however the big grand daddy of time travels h g wells novel the time machine wasn t written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences the author h g wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich idle capitalist class and impoverished labour whatever intentions wells had the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration first of them was george pal who in directed film which would through the years become genre classic of its own the plot revolves about george rod taylor victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension time at the eve of the new th century george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention machine that would enable him to travel through time they are skeptical but that doesn t prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future at first he travels slowly seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars finally after witnessing world war three he travels far into the future hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions when he finally reaches year ad at first glance new world looks like utopia humanity consists of young beautiful but idle eloi people who are fed clothed and taken care of by unseen machines but weena yvette mimieux eloi woman tells george about another side of the coin in the night her people is preyed upon by morlocs humanoid creatures from the underworld the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times for h g wells it was frightening threat of class struggle for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie even the modern audience which would be tempted to discard the film as old fashioned could find some values in its universal messages fit for each era compared with the genre films of today the time machine is even better and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent thought provoking films of course since this is hollywood product after all the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness for example it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today some of the final scenes that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero are also rather unconvincing but on the other hand the film is very well directed cleverly paced and the special effects although definitely old fashioned are more than adequate for this kind of picture the acting is good with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george s trusted friend filby yvette mimieux who plays weena on the other hand would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role however despite all those flaws the time machine is a very good piece of cinema something that connoisseurs of quality science fiction films sorely miss these days 
the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and real movies consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste top flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks the movie represents a rethinking of the story s structure not merely a literal adaptation of the novel told in linear form by four narrators in the book egoyan s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator the author is even on record as applauding egoyan s changes in the press notes the book s author describes the story as a parable of lost children he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children picking up on this egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter nicole burnell played with grace by sarah polley reads parts of the pied piper from an old illustrated book to her two charges periodically throughout the picture nicole s readings are heard in voice over you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment they and the rest of the town s children come into harm s way some live and others are seriously injured and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss ian holm in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career plays mitchell stephens an intense man of quiet misery mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small snow encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness his mission there is a singular one to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone anyone on their behalf if this seems crass well it is but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot the story unfolds slowly and always believably each little aspect has its own fascination as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson he has a simple task he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit wendell ticks off one town member after another and then as one can in a small town enumerates each person s numerous faults although the town is no peyton place people there do have their foibles one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell bruce greenwood who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good bye to his kids well single parent billy s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story the accident itself a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice isn t shown until the middle of the picture but nevertheless the mystery about it builds throughout the film although the picture is no detective story finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy as the injured bus driver gabrielle rose dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning to round out the story mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear his daughter zoe caerthan banks is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half way house and recovery center after another fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk i can help you mitchell tries to reassure billy not unless you can raise the dead billy snaps back mitchell s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder mychael danna s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur but it is in the warm shadowy intimate moments indoors where it works best the show which is ripe for emotional manipulation never plays with its audience still when the house lights go up you may feel as i did i could barely breathe i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed more than anything the film is like a master painting each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint with the final color in place the masterpiece is complete and the ending credits roll the sweet hereafter runs it is rated r for mature themes sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers 
wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that s too long for this epic wannabe that plays more like a tv mini series than a movie the story opens on the earp family farm with young wyatt ready to run away from home he wants to fight in the civil war but his dad hackman has different ideas and wants his son to study law time passes and wyatt heads west returns home to marry and after a spell begins his career in law enforcement by the time he costner and his brothers madsen david andrews and linden ashby arrive in tombstone wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards wyatt earp is very appealing in places such as cast costumes and cinematography but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches somber is fine just ask clint eastwood but this film that boasts not one not two but three count em three hammy death scenes still a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff his uh unusual relations with women for example are an intriguing contrast to his character s credo of nothing counts as much as blood equally amusing is a buffalo hunting and skinning sequence that is decidedly non pc director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief devoid of almost any theatrics don t look for much glorified violence here despite some large exclamation points in the story the characters do come to life the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley to mackenzie astin kevin costner is very good in the title role dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires though but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch he was tougher in a perfect world his foil is dennis quaid who pulled a deniro by losing pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday gaunt and gamely he s a scene stealer who s seen too little other familiar faces include tom sizemore looking like bruce mcgill bill pullman looking like jeff daniels and lea thompson looking like someone other than lea thompson both gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic while late entries catherine o hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid though the story and score should ve tried less is more all other credits are technical tops production designer ida random art director gary wissner and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must ve been an enormous budget clearly no expense was spared 
even if i did not know that director and co writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x files i would have inevitably made a connection the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon like plot to the mysterious characters to the overall dark ominous settings it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie another more important similarity is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie especially when compared to some of the trash of the same genre released in the last couple of years urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch what helps final destination is its unique premise unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders the villain presented is unusual it s the grim reaper this being already has predestined when and how you will die according to the brief history lesson given in this film everyone was meant to die at a certain time some people at others at whatever death chooses what is unique about death is that it s already dead so you can t really kill it the only way to defeat death is to cheat it the question is how do you do that this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash leaving no survivors alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off shortly after the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal however death isn t through with them yet it gradually kills off the seven one by one leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again the plot allows for some of the most creative original death scenes i have seen in a while some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films sure it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ali larter s character is particularly annoying but the shocks from the beginning to the end are extremely entertaining also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won t win any academy awards not even a golden globe the myriad of inside jokes and gags the characters are named after famous horror directors one character who plays a jerk is named carter like x files creator chris carter and a song by john denver who died in a plane crash plays whenever death is near show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie and from this i had a great time watching the movie 
edward zwick s the siege raises more questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate its subject is the rising threat of terrorism in american cities denzel washington is anthony hub hubbard who runs the fbi s anti terrorism task force in new york his investigation into arab terrorist cells intensifies when suicide bombers take out a busload of people hub focuses on a mysterious cia operative annette bening whose goes by both elise and sharon as the terrorist attacks continue and the body count rises the question of martial law is raised enter general devereaux bruce willis who opposes martial law at first but who as soon as the president decides to send in the army begins herding arab immigrants into a prison camp and attacking every link that hub uncovers in the terrorist chain hub listens as devereaux tortures and murders a suspect the future zwick and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible what would happen they ask if terrorism became as much a fact of daily life in new york as it is in cities like beirut and belfast what would happen to our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns these questions the siege answers in realistic detail it implies tougher ones though what can be done to combat terrorism without sacrificing justice and freedom if we encourage terrorism abroad from bening s character we discover that the cia trained the bombers will it inevitably come back to us siege avoids the tougher questions by endowing its hero hub with a uncompromising sense of clear right and wrong this comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils of the modern world is an escape from the thought provoking issues the movie raises still zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he does where so many movies willis die hard series for example offer only a comic book view on terrorism 
 the blair witch project was perhaps one of a kind a unique film that played completely on its own merit managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses its success made a sequel inevitable but this is not the sequel i suspect anyone much wanted after the release of the blair witch project tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity selling twig sculptures stones and dirt like those in the movie and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn shouting get out of these woods and go home there is no goddamned blair witch jeff is one of those people who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage after he got released from the mental institution he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods on the blair witch hunt among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend the pregnant tristen who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called the blair witch history or hysteria and kim who dresses in black and has some psychic powers the last member of the crew is erica a young beautiful witch wannabe who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore saying the first rule of wicca is do no harm because whatever you do will come back to you threefold this strange group plunges into the woods where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr s abandoned house strange things start happening when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies they are somehow lost in time as it loops uncontrollably back and forth they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods documentary director joe berlinger paradice lost helms blair witch leaving the creators of the first film dan myrick and ed sanches in the background the opening scenes the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film is a more promising approach because instead of trying to cover similar ground it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue in a way this is a typical hollywood sequel more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated of course in these situations quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody red forest with carter burwell s being john malkovich and fargo musical score in the background you realize that with the exception of its title this film has absolutely nothing to do with the blair witch project blair witch was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection creating a completely different atmosphere with its graceful cinematography production design and flashy editing the film has a very polished look which is impossible to associate with the first installment and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor the key is simplicity blair witch project had a story which was incredibly simple that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination the film was practically an empty screen on which we projected our most frightening nightmares the effect was incredibly powerful lasting and entir e everyone but in a different way book of shadows feels incredibly controlled and restrict here very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and clever that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with this is simply a less artistic film that doesn t have the talent and originality of its predecessor it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn t always succeed but most importantly it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie which doesn t allow it to destroy the original in the end i can t call it a bad effort it s less artistic not so scary and less original but certainly not bad it s simply different in fact if you haven t seen the blair witch project you might like this film for what it is a cross between the blair witch project and the scream films the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned and incredible sense of surrealism but it s a common knowledge and experience that with a few exceptions every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making to me the story of the blair witch project seemed completed but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that the book of shadows is certainly assured and it s already time to look forward to blair witch 
is evil dead ii a bad movie it s full of terrible acting pointless violence and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots including the original evil dead is extremely difficult well what s it about five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly hairy wart covered monsters come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week why should i see it again no evil dead ii is different it s funny it s funny to see people die are you sick or something maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle as disturbing as it is hilarious an example of raimi s odd approach a monster formerly protagonist ash s girlfriend of all people is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound sure it s over the top but it is so over the top that it is laugh out loud funny just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood staining his face and knocking him back a few feet the whole movie is like this watch ash get beat up watch ash defeat the monster watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets the more amusing it becomes no matter how sick it may sound it is funny to watch bruce ampbell s ash get his butt kicked every five minutes and raimi takes advantage he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend by the body of an old lady even by his own right hand like the less superior idle hands we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part but it doesn t end ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family all of these events thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster like camera movements at first become shocking then inexplicably funny raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers duck soup then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off with a running time of less than an hour and a half raimi gets away with the impossible making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn t wait to make it s sequel 
it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle a jim carrey vehicle at that and so it is the truman show is the most perplexing crazed paranoid and rib tickling morality play i ve seen since i don t know when don t credit carrey it starts with andrew niccol gattaca who created the script ten years ago the story replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience ironically it was within these past ten years that reality based television have become a predominant fixture into our culture who knew one upping niccol it was when unlikely candidate director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone deftly mixing capra with kafka throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling it was weir s first stroke of genius to create seahaven a suburban paradise prison that would make spielberg cower in shame for example bystander extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of dog fancy the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to not leave the island credit weir for his second stroke the casting of carrey carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn on and act goofy whenever the camera is near not here his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination just as well the academy rarely honors goofy comedians excepting robin williams he stretches enough to alter his hyper silly image considerably playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey s life no pun intended better in a smaller more pivotal role is ed harris as christof who mixes the right amount of his apollo work the problem people character with dustin hoffman s megaglomaniac producer in wag the dog and then only slightly svengalian it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman s well being yes in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son and has provided the best universe he could provide he thinks rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone mrs dalloway as carrey s true forbidden love sylvia very effective in another pivotal small role laura linney congo and noah emmerich copland have the unfortunate task of playing truman s wife and best friend their sitcom ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development the exception is at the very beginning where they speak into the camera wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman and for society in general there are other little problems with the script are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years was there any reason as to why in one scene it rained solely on truman even though it never had to how is it they hire hundreds of extras and none of them could drive a boat and yet truman fearful of water is helming a sailboat effortlessly and couldn t christof have turned off the wind to strand truman at sea these little contrivances however do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show and we are drawn to truman s mundane existence for no other reason than it is there the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut upon leaving the theater i was looking up in the sky wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome just checking 
those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo s novel les miserables i don t know if a lot of people have though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel i haven t even seen that going into this film i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters i even expected the film to be a musical walking away from it i m kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material writer director bille august s film version is a straightforward beautifully told film liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean in the beginning he has just been released from a year prison sentence he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior the priest s words of wisdom influence him and he makes a vow to change himself nine years later we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo nobody knows his real name and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago conflicts arise when inspector javert geoffrey rush is assigned to vigo valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him and javert remembers jean to be a convict javert is hell bent on upholding the law and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice along the way valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman fantine uma thurman and vows to take care of her daughter cosette played later by claire danes les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast and the sets don t look like sets they look like real towns and villages gabriella pescucci s costumes are noticeably spectacular basil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually well placed though it does get a bit heavy at times many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality such as the climax which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening augusts keeps the story simple which i hear is a good thing since the novel is so complex and easy to follow he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately i was also impressed that he didn t go overboard with flash and style which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days such as baz luhrmann s vicious tragedy william shakespeare s romeo juliet this film feels solid and whole and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested liam neeson is terrific in the main role neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective thurman in her small role is very good and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non glamorous role such as this one rush is absolutely incredible as javert i don t remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense i can t be as charitable for danes however though i know she is a talented actress here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit les miserables is as i ve said a solid intelligent motion picture my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy and perhaps too staged each scene is grand and huge and exploding with poledouris score but i didn t always want them to be for the most part les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture it s a good movie and tells its story well but august tends to hand feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle however in a film this exciting and well produced a few minor flaws are easily overlooked 
kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow and you instantly know what he s thinking detective story features one of kirk douglas s finest performances he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night the film is based on a play and this is quite evident as most of the movie takes place in the one room flat that the detective s work in the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife but through a series of events he never quite makes it there the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate however this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas s wife a connection douglas himself is not aware of many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film secrets i would not dream of giving away with a name like detective story one would assume the film would resemble an episode of nypd blue but it doesn t quite work out that way however we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time lee grant virtually unrecognizable plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting her scenes with bendix another detective provide the movie with a few laughs the performances all around are fantastic douglas may be the leader of this ensemble but he s not the center of attention all the time we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases which brings me back to douglas he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime but has finally realized that what he s really done is gotten back at his criminal father how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don t seem to see to much of these days he s a tough guy but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior 
plot a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon to whom he s devoted a tribute band in which he sings gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place critique i m a sucker for movies like this a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams works hard devotes the time the energy and the patience and ultimately hits it big time in the case of this film our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it yup luck always finds its way into these types of equations although generally tied very closely to hard work they need a new singer his entry and adaptation to the whole rock n roll lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love or past love of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn t that prominent anymore i still check out my motley crue twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again that s not to say that you won t like this film if you don t like the music but the music and live performances from the band play a big part in the movie and i for one had a blast watching and listening to it all but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg wow hand this fella some major props as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek god incidentally metal god was the film s original title and a much better one if you ask me he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend and the romance angle between them was sweet but she didn t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes i was also impressed by some of the real musicians who played in the film zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne jeff pilson from dokken stephan jenkins from third eye blind blas elias from slaughter but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members it s to note that this film was based on a real life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer their original singer also admitted to being gay as in this film just for the record i m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies but because it s a fun uplifting well paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances oh yeah and for those who dig the heavier side of music the soundtrack also rocks you see dreams can come true where s joblo coming from almost famous blow boogie nights detroit rock city girlfight goodfellas 
capsule the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse the idea is something about ghosts and the internet the film has an amazing apocalyptic style to perhaps the most disturbing and disturbed filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa his films all seem to have one style bleak the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold little known in the us to date his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid his film cure with one of his niftiest ideas is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with cure is probably his classic last year he released seance a remake of seance on a wet afternoon that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non supernatural story pulse is kurosawa back on form taguchi a young computer expert is late with his delivery of some important software two co workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment taguchi acting very strangely lets his friends look for the missing software meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew like spot on the wall taguchi s computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide but they are not entirely dead their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost if they say yes they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing like a computer disk instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death but whatever it does convey is nightmarish kurosawa who directs his own screenplay ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange junichiro hayashi the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa s films creates a dark cold and gloomy tone images are obscured by semi lighting or are behind plastic curtain scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock but a deeper metaphysical dread of any horror filmmaker in the world kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a on the to scale and a on the to scale 
sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes surprised they may have been when they realized that this picture actually had something to say but by the attentiveness of the crowd i d say they were won over as was i i can t tell yet if truman really is that good or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year time alone will make that call but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank s side we were concerned for his well being and wanted him to win that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey who has achieved legitimacy at last the truman show is a film best viewed cold with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot unless you re under a media blackout however you probably know the basics carrey stars as truman burbank a capra esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl laura linney in the south florida island town of seahaven which looks like michael eisner s idea of the perfect american small town truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle complete with a working wife a best bud friendly neighbors and interesting co workers there is tragedy in his past his father drowned in a horrible boating accident leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water and of travel in general but overall life is good but then one day as truman leaves his house for work a klieg light falls magically from the sky this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows that he is a prisoner on the world s biggest soundstage that his wife friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him and that his life has for over days been broadcast as the world s most popular television program what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir the soundstage we re told is only the second man made structure visible from space truman s movements are tracked ceaselessly by cameras scattered throughout the town button cams dashboard cams mirror cams wife cams big cams and small cams weir cuts the film so we re never quite sure if we re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show s omnipotent creator christof ed harris who oversees the show from a control room built into the man made moon in seahaven s sky the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence his best friend marlon noah emmerich always has a six pack of beer with him his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town one wonders why he didn t pick up on any of this earlier but christof has an answer for this people tend to accept the reality with which they re presented nevertheless truman begins to grow restless and dreams of escape to fiji where an old college sweetheart natasha mcelhone supposedly lives this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way by underplaying truman he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon and marlon answers with best friend sincerity i d gladly step in front of a bus for you but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home and from that moment we re on his side the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies haven t we all at least once doubted our place in the world doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ultimately however the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator what does god really think of us does he resent our abandonment of paradise who exactly is watching us up there in the sky if you enjoy the picture as much as i did credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work as for carrey well truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play carrey is no jimmy stewart to his credit he doesn t try to be he just tries to feel the way you or i would if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us 
bruce willis is a type casted actor in die hard he played john mcclaine a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time again in pulp fiction as butch coolidge an over the hill boxer he steps on the wrong guys toes in luc besson s the fifth element willis plays korben dallas a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time a stylish science fiction epic the fifth element s complex plot begins right away in the deserts of egypt think stargate in an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the elements are stored and takes them away vowing to return them when the evil comes back cut to present day which is our future the year is and new york is the city the only basic differences between besson s futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker the buildings are higher and the traffic floats anyway the evil comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth so back come the tortoise like aliens to return the elements to earth in order to defend themselves against the evil in the process however the ship is intercepted by fighter pods and is destroyed before landing when officials arrive at the site all that remains is a hand what can you do with a hand hey its the st century here dna reconstruction this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful but mysterious woman named leeloo milla jovovich dazed and confused she escapes and attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben s floating cab it s love at first site as korben and leeloo elude the lazy as always cops when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ian holm night falls on manhattan korben searches the yellow pages and delivers her to the door of the good reverend the only man who knows of her background and duties now korben leeloo and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship special effects were spectacular here to find the remaining four elements it is here where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean baptiste emmanuel zorg gary oldman murder in the first he too wants possession of the elements as do a group of pig like warriors think the gamorreans in return of the jedi in a spectacular ending with time running out leeloo is faced with a problem why should she save a people who live to destroy each other the question is a good one and one that could be pondered but enough of that when korben points out his love for her leeloo is inclined to become the th element and save the world from total destruction the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson s the joker in batman by one of the masters of villainy oldman and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich the supporting cast which includes brion james tango cash tim tiny lester no holds barred luke perry buffy the vampire slayer and chris tucker friday added a comedic effect to the film although besson s the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches it is a solid motion picture with a definite point some other directors like anaconda s luis llosa should take a lesson from this guy using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film sci fi fan or not any movie lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture 
the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it s adequately explained by the commercials with days to go until the election the president who we never see calls in political dirty tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a pageant a phony war against albania fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville with woody harrelson as the reluctant psychotic hero and if there wasn t anything more to the movie than this it would be a second rate heist comedy at best enlivened by great actors like sneakers goes to washington a heist comedy yup deniro and hoffman are stealing the election so to speak and the movie is more about how they do it and the fun they have doing it than anything else wag the dog succeeds because it s based one great truth the american people are stupid ok maybe it s not love thy neighbor as thyself or even two plus two makes four but a truth nonetheless any average person who thinks that they re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes moviemaking and the political process is invited nay challenged to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or hours straight watching c span when the house is in session and because we re so utterly predictably stupid hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo washington knows that we won t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies and deniro s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won t be able to locate albania on the map the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn t a light meaningless comedy about politics like speechless the michael keaton geena davis picture or from the level of light hearted politcal satire to near greatness nor is it a hard edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally deprived ethically challenged baby boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house like primary colors and yes i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out thanks for asking instead david mamet s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers schemes come off beautifully and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables without any of the violent rages it s all what do i love what is it that brings me joy baseball minus the savage bloody beating with the bat he threatens a lot of people mind you but he s doing it in a very nice polite way it s a very mellow restrained performance which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script hoffman on the other hand is giddy exuberant and joyous this kind of thing is what his character lives for and he s so excited that he can t even shut up even on the edge of disaster he s bright eyed behind oddly tinted sunglasses and positive insiders note that he s basing his character on some powerful but anonymous producer which may or may not be true but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets put on a show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them listen to them talk in that wised up mamet dialogue get to know them better which we don t anne heche is dead bang on in her portrayal of a political press aide cool and composed on the outside panicked and frenzied on the outside denis leary one of my favorite actors see the ref is the fad king who handles the profitable back end t shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative innovative ways to separate a fool from his money they could make a whole movie just about the fad king and i d go see it willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song to the weepy country waltz to the hilarious ballad of the green berets parody woody harrelson has a brief but memorable part as the overmedicated hero of the albanian conflict craig t nelson as the opposition candidate and the ever reliable william h macy as a wacky cia agent are given surprisingly short shrift one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems the trivialization of american politics the role of the press in dumbing down the issues the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars the list goes on we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don t

the verdict spine chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king featuring an outstanding oscar winning performance from kathy bates geez french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this sorry non british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders my apologies the pair are british comediennes jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in absolutely fabulous who did a series of film spoofs a few years back including alien the exorcist and misery needless to say amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates the resemblance was quite uncanny dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder s legs but despite the lingering memory of their sketch and although i ve now seen the film a couple of times now that hobbling scene was no less disturbing i m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion that may be the most memorable scene but it s certainly not the only worth watching stephen king whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale it s a nicely crafted psychological horror which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon james caan rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes bates who introduces herself as the writer s number one fan he soon becomes her prisoner both the script and kathy bates beautifully masterful performance for which she won an oscar work arm in arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit cake or is that fruity as a nut cake bates relishes her demanding role and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour at times she s a rather tragic character and more often than not she s just damned scary this is basically a very simple tale but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity it s an involving engrossing experience and considering it s basically a two hander mainly set in one locale it s a remarkable piece of cinema there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences this one relies solely upon rob reiner s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan oh i haven t really mentioned caan yet he does a good job as the writer who s a prisoner of his own success annie is obsessed with him and his books but as you no doubt gathered from the above bates is well and truly the star of the show along with the pig of course anyway the tension is built up with masterful aplomb and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense there s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve shattering lengths to poison her wine he succeeds but she knocks the glass over i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well in the immortal words of homer j simpson d oh other nerve wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house we cut to annie in her car she s on her way home he realises this and tries to get back to his room cut to the car again she s getting near will he make it ok so these sequences aren t exactly original nor perhaps unpredictable but they work boy do they work if a film has you on the edge of your couch biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense then it s doing something right of course the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned hobbling annie realises her captive has been out of his room and she s going to stop him once and for all cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer and i feel ill just thinking about it nasty it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho and then we re given one of the most ridiculously over the top fight scenes i ve ever seen she gets hit over the head with a typewriter set on fire head smashed against the wall and she just won t die sheldon isn t in terribly good shape either if it weren t so gorey it would almost be laughable but it s a terrifically effective film and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked misery is a tight tense intense and chillingly entertaining thriller the directing is first rate and the performances bates in particular contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem wonderful stuff for more regularly updated film and tv reviews check out my site http www geocities com hollywood bungalow

available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment with an introduction by david carradine written produced by wayne j keeley f w murnau s career ended sadly and prematurely the german director of such classics as sunrise and the last laugh died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount murnau was reportedly a giant man well over six feet a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance which brings us to nosferatu a symphony of horror surely he felt a kinship with his title character the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck in one of the most indelible images in film history silent or otherwise schreck rises from his grave gnarled hands outstretched and he s so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame the plot of nosferatu is lifted unauthorized from bram stoker s dracula the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania he leaves behind girlfriend emily only to discover orlock s secret he s a bloodsucker and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love in addition to schreck s performance the cinematography and effects are outstanding arrow video s digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed coffin the cover art features a red tinted hairy goateed vampire staring straight at you his fanged mouth agape while the bodies of two sexy writhing women entice you below trouble is murnau s monster is pale faced bald pointy eared and non goateed and there isn t a single sexy writhing woman to be found in his movie this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted additionally notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau s film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire that said a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself the original elements are not in the best condition non studio silents were unlucky in their preservation so we re still dealing with a slightly washed out scratched jittering image but at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue respectively especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu s waltzing around during what seems like sunlight it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties the title cards have been redone and they are legible accurate and digitally altered to flicker a very nice touch even the opening copyright warning flickers the score has been replaced by music from type o negative a hard rock group arguably gothic and their songs underscore the film nicely certainly the coolest video a band can ask for when our hero hutter first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock s castle we hear a well timed now you re dead from lead singer peter steele david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film after the feature which runs about minutes is included a new music video from type o negative the black and white fang fest black no of course nosferatu a symphony of horror is the main attraction and while my latest viewing raised questions why is the woman called emily in the title cards but mina as bram stoker called her in hutter s letters for instance it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from coppola s bram stoker s dracula owes a great stylistic debt to murnau s masterpiece but the one thing it couldn t thieve was the original s abstract charms this latest incarnation from arrow will probably like the rescored metropolis a few years back turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks

in intolerance d w griffith told four different historical stories at the same time cutting from one to the other each of the stories builds to a fast paced climax in magnolia paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others yet the stories and where they are going are all independent what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized each story builds to a tense moment or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment but then lets the tension dissolve while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along even though they are not in the same scene then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked this creates some strange effects the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content we have the story of a dying man earl partridge jason robards wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends phil parma philip seymour hoffman is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal partridge s young wife linda julianne moore is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies but for an unsuspected reason frank mackey tom cruise runs the kinds of self help seminar that businesses like so much but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women s lib officer jim kurring john c reilly is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place jimmy gator philip baker hall hosts a popular children s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector jeremy blackman and former quiz kid donnie smith william h macy the film juggles all these stories for over three hours but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history but it really has little to do with the content of the stories though they all are connected in part by one weird event magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson though in my opinion his two previous films hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson s company john c reilly seems to be a standard fixture particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight here he several of the characters are mesmerizing but that characteristic is not really used as studies of characters these stories are each worth following as well rounded stories with a beginning middle and end they leave something to be desired but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through i rate it a on the to scale and a low on the to scale heavy spoiler heavy spoiler heavy spoiler heavy spoiler during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen and in actual fact it does since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods it is however a perfectly natural if somewhat unnerving phenomenon the cause is associated with whirlwinds we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air holding them aloft the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are when the whirlwind is over water animals near the surface frequently fish and frogs may suffer the same fate essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind held aloft by updrafts and finally dropped elsewhere so while the rain is possible some doubts do creep in the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon frankly i have no idea on these points otherwise the event was quite believable what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants however a rain of frogs though it feels biblical is most definitely not a biblical portent note that the previous verse says and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 
after hearing reviews for woody allen s upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring to just so so my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time woody allen s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand in hand manhattan really is one of the best looking films i ve ever seen beautiful black and white photography of the city s best areas etc a fan can t help but feel visibly moved the film opens up with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with an airplane beethoven s th blasts on the soundtrack the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment and it s all rather lovely to look at and then we cut to a film crew shooting this as the film s hilariously banal key moment in the film where the lead actress in the film melanie griffith looking as buxom and beautiful as ever has to realize something s wrong with her life or whatever it s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film with the great opening shots or without and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works though for the record last year s deconstructing harry came awfully close what the hell has happened to him the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas bullets over broadway though wonderful relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off mighty aphrodite is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story everyone says i love you was more of a great idea than a great film even deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in a way even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films if anything the reception of celebrity by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time it s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is it s him celebrity is yes a good film but it s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film instead of creating the great woody allen world he s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about and he s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections it s like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis woody becoming more insecure in his old age choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead much has been said about his performance dead on but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh s performance though featuring some of the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots o hand gestures is hardly a warts and all impersonation branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm which actually allows for his character s flaws to be more apparent woody s a flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because he s really funny and really witty and really intelligent branagh s allen is a bit more flat out bad but with the same charm so that yes we like him but we re still not sure if he s really a good person or not his character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hits on extra actress winona ryder then goes off to interview griffith who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her and she denies him sorta we then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script a bank robbery movie but with a deep personal crisis as such he has divorced his wife of several years allen regular judy davis and continues on a quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film after griffith comes his escapades with a model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad to see allen is using new jokes ha ha who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen a relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades with ryder whom he fancies most of all his story is juxtaposed with that of davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status while lee is fumbling about selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy i ve become the kind of woman i ve always hated and i m loving it without doing a thing the result is a film of highs and mediums the mediums are what take up most of the film with sitations and scenes which don t exactly work but you can t help but pat allen on the back for trying but other places are really great scenes the opening the sequence with theron which is so good that i wished it hadn t ended a banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll as ever and perhaps the best sequence a romp with hot as hell teen idol brandon darrow played by none other than leo dicaprio who is so un dicaprio esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film they d never look at him the same way he ignites the screen with intensity and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read and finds himself on a wild all day ride with him they go to atlantic city to watch a fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow gets it on with his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupies allen s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them i d almost recommend the film almost but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it s a mess despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself it s still a smart and insightful film though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities as it may seem to be if it were it d be extremely out of touch but about those who want to be celebrities and how they equate celebrity hood with happiness we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they re really happy they may appear to be on the surface but we do get close enough to lee and davis character lee is obsessed with the phenomenon while davis takes is at arm s length and never gets too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself besides it s witty and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen s that great woody allen feel it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject and yes as a part of woody allen s oeuvre it s merely a blip no annie hall but it s no shadows and fog either but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice 
while watching wes anderson s rushmore it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer the film s anti hero was not written with jason schwartzman in mind the young actor making his film debut as a year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman schwartzman plays max a student who is more interested in his extra curricular activities such as writing edgy plays like serpico and being president of the rushmore beekeepers but sees his grades suffer as a result on the brink of being thrown out he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross olivia williams and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume the great bill murray to build an aquarium on rushmore s baseball field in her honour unfortunately for everyone involved blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well which gets in the way of max s plans to woo her max is one of the best written characters we ve yet seen in the s and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age as everyone else has probably already pointed out he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman although i was reminded more of paul from the wonder years from a visual standpoint at least hopefully if he avoids typecasting as weird quirky loner types he should earn himself a good career bill murray is his equal as blume displaying a depth we haven t yet seen from him while this isn t his best performance that honour goes to groundhog day he is still terrific here williams isn t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray but still does fine work rushmore seems to go just a little too long but while it isn t a perfect film it is a definate must see for anyone who wants to see that rarity an american coming of age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should with any luck rise to even greater success 
of all the films i ve come to see this year i think only chasing amy had as many laugh out loud moments i m not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes and i think i m the kind of person that laughs least at movies even when i find them funny usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile so to get me laughing out loud and so frequently is a really good sign waiting for guffman is the story of blaine missouri a town celebrating it s th anniversary and the musical that is being put on for the big event the play is being directed by corky st clair christopher guest who also wrote and directed this mockumentary as well as co writing several original musical numbers the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success teaming up with st clair are a handful of blaine residents allan pearl eugene levy a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown but sitting right next to him and studying him ron and sheila albertson fred willard and catherine o hara respectively a married couple setting their sights on hollywood libby mae brown parker posey the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen and a few others everybody in this movie is brilliant absolutely so but levy particularly stands out these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can t help but love them as pathetic as they really are although levy stands out guest willard o hara and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance this is the group that should sweep it some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and even after starting very humorously they nearly lost me with the tad too long intros as delightful as it was it began to get monotonous thankfully just as your about to say ok maybe i should run to the bathroom they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes like a play this film gives a very three act feel the intros funny but almost too long the rehearsals even funnier and finally the actual performance of the play excellent like i said each character really shines even when done with a subtle approach you can t really watch these people and not think they re real people even they way they talk with awkward pauses and stumbles that don t feel staged at all you feel like you re watching a real albeit funny documentary and even with silly lyrics the original songs when the play is finally put on are absolutely wonderful as a word of note despite it s r rating waiting for guffman is really quite clean this rating came from a brief very brief use of the grand daddy of all swear words even if that really bothers you let me say that it s not presented in a vulgar cheap laugh way it s actually quite humorous and tastefully done it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman it s silly humor but it s also so dry subtle and intelligently done that you re not insulted by it it s always really nice to see a comedy that isn t all slapstick and vulgarity and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones i d recommend seeing it 
driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small intimate story it s a quiet film a slow film a deliberate film but if you re patient with it the movie offers innumerable rewards such as a pair of self assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry s pulitzer prize winning play of the same name which first opened in new york four years ago the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago los angeles london vienna norway and the soviet union uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy he also penned the wonderful sleeper mystic pizza the film like the play is set in atlanta georgia and it revolves around two people in their twilight years a cranky something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a something black man who becomes her chauffeur the movie relies on character rather than plot to propel the action in fact the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense it doesn t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together rather driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life shopping listening to the radio visiting the cemetery eating fried chicken and so on the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta s history including the bombing of the temple the city s oldest jewish congregation and a ceremony honoring the reverend dr martin luther king jr the story begins in with daisy tandy crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway the insurance company cancels her insurance and her son boolie decides to hire her a chauffeur freeman reprising his role from the play plays the chauffeur hoke the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature aging prejudice and a great many other things but more than anything it s about a relationship one that spans years cars the advent of civil rights and one gravely important cent can of salmon daisy is strong willed and set in her ways and from the outset she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur initially she treats hoke with contempt refusing to let him drive her anywhere once she does get in the car daisy is the ultimate back seat driver to make matters worse she is extremely self conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand eventually however daisy is worn down by hoke s good natured charm and infectious cheer she softens and opens up to him tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well but unfortunately this feisty cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace we ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations from on golden pond to cocoon nevertheless tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own freeman as hoke on the other hand gives the more distinctive of the two performances there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color hoke is uneducated and illiterate but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element in full command of their natural charisma they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie s gentle humor at the same time tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama in his first dramatic role dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie tandy s loving and patient son drama seems to agree with aykroyd taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ghostbusters ii the great outdoors my stepmother is an alien the only other significant characters in the film are daisy s housekeeper idella marvelously played by esther rolle good times and boolie s pretentious wife played by patti lupone under the direction of bruce beresford crimes of the heart tender mercies driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again but fortunately beresford never forgets he s shooting a movie and accordingly he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches such as gorgeous shots of flowers trees and tomatoes in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film s dramatic moments the movie tugs at your heart but it never goes for the jugular the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees 
originally launched in this popular film was re introduced in to a whole new generation of moviegoers based on the mighty successful musical from broadway grease was followed in with the less stellar grease starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles plot high school musical set in the s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t birds travolta and the innocent and pure sandy olsen newton john from australia the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song dance and humour critique fun loving energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the s with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers admittedly i am somewhat biased in this opinion since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth grease was one of schmoe s first big screen experiences and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble gum card collection and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time but apart from the nostalgic vibe i was still extremely impressed by this film as it continued to amuse me despite my previous dozen or so viewings this film took john travolta from a dim witted sweathog on tv s welcome back kotter and transformed him into a movie star of spectacular proportions saturday night fever in confirmed that sudden popularity unfortunately for the rest of the cast his popularity was not terribly contagious despite their effective showings in this classic movie on the down side some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off like when sandy sings about drinking lemonade and staying out until with danny in summer nights and the plot isn t exactly the most elaborate story line ever created but despite these small reservations this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid minute running time and believe me i am not a fan of the musicals make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film s absolute highlights and don t forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you re feeling a little blue little known facts henry winkler of tv s happy days fonzie fame turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton john during the filming of this picture conaway eventually bowed out of the woo fest and married newton john s sister a year later divorced after five years 
jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation this is after all the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio desperado four rooms and from dusk til dawn he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide i m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films but never took the director s helm nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more tarantino returns with a film he can call his own the film opens up with an homage to the graduate with jackie brown pam grier on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi samuel l jackson who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico however while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u s for ordell jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus michael bowen and atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton who catch her not only with the money but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs jackie didn t know they were in the package with the cash but that s of no consequence to the authorities who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted of course dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish ordell ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry robert forster to get jackie out of jail but while max is immediately attracted to her jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police sure enough ordell shows up at jackie s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good but she borrows max s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol s chamber to ordell s head jackie proposes a deal since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more but this time for a more substantial fee fifteen percent of ordell s half million dollars with a gun in his face how can ordell not agree by itself this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film however we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell but she s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around instead it s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today s movies at least this film has a little imagination most of the performances in jackie brown are above par pam grier of whom i had never taken notice before plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable samuel l jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy trying to do his best never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course he s just so down to earth the nature of his job really doesn t occur to us even when we re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison or when we see the tools of his trade in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara a recently paroled friend of ordell s and bridget fonda as melanie one of the girls ordell keeps around town unfortunately de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between and then they are mostly clipped sentences in this film he s not really de niro but stereotypical de niro uttering things like little bit and pretty much fonda on the other hand plays the slightly spaced out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness such that even when she is annoying louis we are taking her side as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand the dialog is quick and snappy it grabs our attention and is actually interesting and in many respects this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves don t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera however there s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange and he s not really sure what s happening but by composing the scene just so his realization of what s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience we look at the screen and think gee that s clever and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on although tarantino isn t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film there are shots where a character is simply driving and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head this is a tribute to both direction and acting however there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall and she is looking for something desperately looking for something we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she s looking for but instead hoping she ll just stop overall viewing jackie brown is time spent well some flap has already been made about the language used in the film but it s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today in fact one might even be able to say that the way in which these offensive words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness go see the film and see what i mean 
 lake placid is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie ok so maybe it is but this one is enjoyable and clever actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film well the ending is kinda scary but in most horror comedies they are i will admit that lake placid isn t an oscar worthy film but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth after a man is bit in half she gets there but really doesn t understand why she is there bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man they go out and find what is going on what they find though isn t great a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid over years old he has migrated here for who knows why they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid and well you ll have to see the movie to find out her character is very funny and foul mouthed which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad but funny to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws with the opening sequence and some others it is not original and is when you watch this movie you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it david e kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job the characters have smartmouths two foul and some great one liners but believe me don t take lake placid too seriously or you won t like it but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun popcorn type movie but i guess it rates above the popcorn rating sit back watch the movie laugh scream and whatever you want even though the movie is r and i put violence and gore there s really not that much gore but what there is might seem kinda gross to some lake placid is a smart clever funny and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too

accepting his oscar as producer of this year s best picture winner saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over one could almost say the same about his much prized film rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery symbolism ideas and metaphors complex and literate storytelling all possessed of an intelligence that invites even demands constant scrutiny an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth in short the antithesis of all things hollywood yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind ralph fiennes is the title character an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory and particularly the memory of love is the ostensible focus of the film but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld the same can easily be said for every other character in the film of which there are too many juliette binoche s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious disfigured dying stranger even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion however that it verges on the comical with so many characters enjoying so little screen time the film s minutes can be taxing yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn t help but feel that greatness was in the air hints of it were everywhere in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern day swimmer in the sahara in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years but ultimately the emotional truths writer director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed in the end i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron a haunting bore bore is perhaps too strong a word but after drinking in the rich production values the cup remains only slightly over half full 
waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury joe says after all we re human in the context of events to transpire joe s line is prophetic foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film does being human necessarily imply humane behavior through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria in the scene prefacing the lynching the mob achieves critical mass at the bar deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant but when he is unable to augment the mob s myth of joe he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless to the audience the deputy s quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob s delirium crescendos lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera but rather its stillness the shot s composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers it does so around the viewer as well the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality because the camera does not track the deputy s movement we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability as the bar scene progresses the camera pans degrees to reveal the fury of the mob this shot is unique because it is a point of view shot where the audience not a character in the film is the subject while a long or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob panning from the mob s belly distorts the audience s spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large we see close shots of people s faces contorted by their rage with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob lang s camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail in some greater sense it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind lang s observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior as joe faces his peril trapped in his burning cell his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality lang depicts man s volatility and impulse towards inconceivable cruelty reprising joe s line at the train station we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity 
nosferatu the vampyre germany a film review by mike watson copyright mike watson this extraordinary re telling of bram stoker s dracula by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore inspired by f w murnau s silent film of the same name herzog s film is a work of exquisite bleakness an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards the original full length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u s distributor anchor bay entertainment and in gorgeous widescreen prints until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video and only in europe both of these re releases restore the film to its full length but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one everyone knows the story of dracula or do they his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won t hurt jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count played by klaus kinski who wants to buy a house in harker s hometown upon seeing a photo of harker s wife the radiant isabelle adjani he instantly falls in love with her locking harker up in his castle he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him upon divining his identity as a vampire adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises that is a story familiar to millions but herzog has elevated stoker s tale into the realm of and i use this term a tad reluctantly cinematic art nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film shot through blue ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised the film s surreal dream like quality is utterly mesmerising there is much to enjoy but i ll limit my praise to a few key points holding the film together is kinski s remarkable performance as count dracula past screen portrayals including bela lugosi s famous turn have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp but kinski oh boy this is something far more compelling aided by a startling make up job he portrays dracula s vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease this man is dreadfully lonely he lives in utter solitude shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust kinski s portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting when he dies you almost feel as if this man s tortured soul has been freed at last then there s the unforgettable soundtrack largely composed by german group popul vuh it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it s quite impossible to imagine the film without it popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient sounding kind of spacemusic using piano chants and exotic instruments when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums the one i still listen to the most is tantric songs from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken it s a testament to the music s depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies this is a timely re release by anchor bay after francis ford coppola s unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker s tale in it is a joy to go back to herzog s film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century old story to some aficionados nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made without a doubt it is an unmistakable classic of the genre don t miss it 
one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made se en is just a few steps away from brilliance however those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss the film received mixed reviews upon release but there s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate pay off are excellent the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable this piece of work is intensity it s uncomfortable to watch yet compelling i want not to look yet i cannot turn away the story creeps along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions but not giving away too much too soon this is the guy who directed the ominous alien se en is even more ominous because the threat is real it s human and while the script takes some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic that is if a human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned after the most bizarre opening credits i ve ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development takes place morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society brad pitt co stars as detective david mills the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys these two fine actors give the film its human qualities along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who plays tracy mills wife however none of them stands out above the material no disrespect intended but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same an ironic note is that somerset has only a week or that s seven days left on the force to train his young protege the title of the picture also refers to the deadly sins as chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath incidentally i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found it s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking but i won t give that away as i said this has a great ending and no one should spoil it anyway the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the sinners suffer for it the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man they learn that he was murdered forced to eat himself to death the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and of course somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way if they didn t it would be one short movie the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story we see a lot of blood but it s not especially violent the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown like most of the violence in pulp fiction se en is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is post death still if you tend to get queasy don t eat food during this film kevin spacey plays john doe the avenging angel who claims that he s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings like many crazy men he has some fine ideas but some sick ways of expressing himself spacey doesn t appear until the final minutes and also doesn t receive billing in the opening credits however it s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not this character is so well written that it s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone no serial killer has ever been so creative se en is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it s often a little too depressing what it lacks in those areas it makes up for with believable dialogue top notch screenwriting unexpected twists and realistic characters the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive fincher uses lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film fortunately we don t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits which are run backwards up the screen it s better to imagine what paths they will follow this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget it s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing the evils of the world aren t going to cure themselves se en raises some tough questions and it s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves useless trivia co stars in s se en brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the best supporting actor oscar pitt in monkeys spacey in the usual suspects for which he won 
in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen style earnestly shallow gen x angst pictures it seemed to be actually about something it angered people started arguments outside the theater riled things up it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film having endured my share of the hype i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about does men live up to its press well yes it does and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office for the uninitiated newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment chad and howard are archetypes examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business chad is the blond golden boy genetically engineered for success the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder howard is chad s boss but he is weaker of will the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office woo her simultaneously win her love and then dump her the reason both men have recently been dumped themselves and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex it ll restore a little dignity to our lives he says howard helpless against the force of chad s will agrees to the plan they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine stacy edwards a fragile deaf woman working as a temp chad moves in for the kill flashing his golden boy smile plying christine with lunch then flowers then dinner howard follows suit though his efforts are in contrast ham handed and desperate flattered to have the attention of two eligible men christine dates them both you can guess which one she falls for soon a tragic lovers triangle develops christine loves chad chad loves himself and howard loves christine on the grounds that since she s handicapped and shy she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high does it in chad writer director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film hannibal lector may eat human flesh but chad is an eater of souls his evil is as subtle as a viper s and as easy as his smile we watch in stunned disbelief as he back stabs coworkers humiliates his subordinates and works his deadly venom into christine s heart his character would be a joke if he wasn t so chillingly real all of us have worked with a chad and some of us may be him he s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness if one of his co workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns he had best have his escape route clearly in mind politics is his game and the modern cubicle filled office is his playground men wears the guise of a black comedy but it functions best as allegory the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company then forces him to prove it in a manner i won t describe the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril could it happen in the real world probably not taken as allegory however it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society maybe it s just the english major in me but chad in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism of greed without conscience the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism only the strong will survive the marvel of labute s multi layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way but does the film work as entertainment its darned funny in spots particularly in the men s room scenes which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions it works less well as drama since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine and succeeds in making us care for her but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her likewise chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions by the end of the film you ll feel as if you ve met a genuine monster in chad perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed but the picture is often mesmerizing and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship which makes it well worth your time like all good films it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world while watching chad in his moment of triumph i couldn t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs there may be a little bit of chad in all of us but some of us have taken chad ness to the level of art 
not since s shine which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world class musicians in fact if one were to watch these films together it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills yet hilary and jackie the sophomore effort from director anand tucker has something more to say it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale playing the sisters du pr both musicians from childhood hilary griffiths is renowned flutist while jacqueline watson is easily as skilled on the cello the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women both together and seperate their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another s and although their lives take very different paths hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour they are bound together by their deep family love the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance they contrast each other wonderfully and while watson s portrayal of jackie du pr is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic both characters are charged with emotion the frank cottrell boyce script which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well the script is also to be commended for its well polished dual nature cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne s script for mission impossible and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised nevertheless hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around 
i actually am a fan of the original or so live action disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins separated at birth by divorcing parents never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again and everyone should know how i feel about remakes especially of films i happen to enjoy my fallacy unless you re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up with a gasp new idea this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list and was actually quite the opposite contemporary live action disney films are not one of my favorties anyway they re usually unfunny alienating and a big fat bore at least to anyone over the age of and above the iq of this one however is shockingly not bad in fact it s actually good not the original good but what s great about it is that it doesn t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining because it s cute and innocent fun because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with because the lead star is immensely appealing because the parents are also immensely appealing and i m repeating myself because it s cute and innocent fun there s nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and it s aimed directly at either kids adults who want to remember the original or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid i personally am somewhere between the second and third i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn t so weird or diverse the names godard and kubrick weren t even a glimmer in my right eye back then when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc s wonderful world of disney where they d show you a live action and or made for tv disney flick an hour per week i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly i remember every single christmas without fail there were a barage of children s animated half hour shows made exclusively for the christmas season that i wouldn t dare missing i can even remember seeing the made for tv parent trap ii on tv one night and after i had seen that one over and over and over again i saw the original parent trap it s more of a late childhood movie because it deals with the issue of divorce but it deals with it in a disney ized version it s playful and witty and charming and if i saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood i d probably dismiss it i d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn t seen the original at such a perfect age watching it i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly perfect parents splitting up and how it affected my adolescence and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fucked up of situations things could always work out if you well manipulate things a bit at least for the better this new version did that for me but it s also charming in its own way it has a new cast a contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for a live action disney flick a tone that isn t corny or condescending but just right the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way and for the first time since the original film the kids actually know better than the foolish adults the story is basically classic by now repeated almost as many times as kurosawa s the seven samurai a pair of twins played here by lindsay lohan just like they were played by hayley mills in the original are separated at birth by their divorcing parents one annie is sent to live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than i had ever noticed in london where she lives with her parents and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz as she works as a swingin fashion designer she grows up refined and classy but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker playing the other hallie is sent to northern california with her father dennis quaid to live on a vineyard with their pseudo maid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming they both meet at the same camp one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged they feud because they look all too similar and are thus in tight competition which results in some nasty pranks which winds them in seclusion together in a private out of the way cabin there they become friends then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent whom they ve only heard of they learn about eachother s lives in detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously ear piercing a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer comes they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan doesn t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original but she comes off just as appealing as she did once she does though add a couple new things she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also adds on an american and british accent to each one with one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake ones accents aren t exactly perfect she s also incredibly appealing not merely cute which is especially notable since this is her first feature film and we know how notorious child actors are especially in their first films she makes a great protagonist and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing dennis quaid in fact hasn t been this likable in about a decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past not just that he s mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasn t ever been this likable period the two make a winning couple maybe not so winning as maureen o hara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this film instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original during the opening credits we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother and when back together again the film s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraine inducing way as in many such films this all brings this new parent trap to a level of entertainment that hasn t really existed since well the original film years ago still my money the best live action disney flick of all time this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot a gold digging sharon stone type played by elaine hendrix who s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film a treat instead of a bore like the original this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it takes two starring the olsen twins because it treats the children as the smart ones and the adults as the silly ones not the other way around and because above everything it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew however in comparison with the original it could be a bit better certain scenes work well but not nearly as well as they worked in the original i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing a lesson extracted from the howard hawks cary grant films of yesteryear and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom compared to the original this film almost drowns in cutedom the original though not gritty was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences as such this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances 
look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future some sort of decision had to be made and for better or worse it irrevocably altered the course of your existence from time to time everyone thinks about the roads not taken and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action catching the am train for example could have an equally profound yet less obvious impact maybe that s where you met your significant other and had you reached the platform just a few seconds later film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else and that s why there s no shortage of movies about this subject the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance these themes weave their way through many of his movies including decalogue the double life of veronique and the triptych of blue white and red however they are most explicitly examined in a film called blind chance where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action missing or catching a train changes the course of his life in his autobiography kieslowski on kieslowski the director describes his attraction to the concept this way the idea is rich and interesting that every day we re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we re completely unaware while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films including in a way frank capra s it s a wonderful life sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths the road not taken approach isn t just a plot device either writer director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses catches a train the audience watches with ever growing fascination how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life her future career where she lives whom she loves and whether she has a family as her separate destinies diverge and then re converge she becomes two completely different individuals that woman is helen played by gwyneth paltrow as a long dark haired brit one day after losing her job as an advertising executive she decides to return home in the middle of the day the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform in scenario she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station on board she meets the cheerful talkative james john hannah a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty minutes later in her flat she walks in on her lover gerry john lynch in bed with another woman jeanne tripplehorn in scenario she misses the train and shortly thereafter is the victim of an attempted mugging she doesn t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry s infidelity juxtaposed one against the other while sharing many places cues and characters the two stories proceed in parallel from there on one level for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience but for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting a script with a few twists and a great deal of genuinely funny material sliding doors still fits the bill one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures and those who could care less it shouldn t come as any surprise that the acting at least from three of the four leads is solid paltrow who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same yet gradually become much different is the standout she plays both of her roles effectively and believably the shy insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated platinum blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man john hannah known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral is instantly likable john lynch taking a break from movies about ireland s troubles does a good job presenting gerry as a inept selfish philanderer only jeanne tripplehorn who plays an over the top vixen seems out of place her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring and it s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice douglas mcferran who plays gerry s best friend russell is an absolute delight stealing every scene that he s in part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie on one occasion he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy on another occasion while laughing at gerry s plight with the women in his life he comments being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable but it s not all in the dialogue mcferran tears into this part with relish his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top notch comedy this is the first feature film for peter howitt and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb the script is shrewd and inventive combining wit romance and intelligent melodrama into a crowd pleasing whole sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies however for those who are so inclined its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe all while having a good time 
contact is the movie i ve seen the most five times to be exact four of those times were on the big screen but even on a tv it s a very impressive film the same can t be said for films like independance day but that s because contact is a rare example in sci fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects and all of us know looking back that id didn t offer much outside of some one time delightful eye candy contact s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway jodie foster a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of merely listening to sounds out in space her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age encouraged by her loving father ted david morse who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola fl that was of course before the days of internet chat rooms while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra terrestrial intelligence of which the program seti is an acronym for ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive ellie s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young in puerto rico she meets palmer joss matthew mcconaughey a writer examining the effects of technology on the world s overall happiness a one time seminary student who describes himself as a man of the cloth without the cloth despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a supreme being ellie and palmer hit it off and even take the time to sleep together it s a weak and hurried relationship but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on meanwhile dr david drumlin tom skerritt who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation and only a one night stand to remember it is in this nm city where several months later ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science when the signal is closely examined many new developments spring up and before long drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at eventually it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega where the signal seems to have originated the media swarms fanatics go further off the deep end scientists clamor for new information politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality remember when zemeckis couldn t get enough of this in forrest gump as if that weren t enough ellie s discovery leads her to the nation s capital where she again runs into palmer contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs religion the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented with no signs of bias arguments for both sides are intelligent solid and thought provoking when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega of which ellie is a leading candidate personal convictions play a more important role than love interests the question is can a person who doesn t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when of the planet does believe in a higher power even when the film wraps up it s uncertain whether it s meant to play as an advocate for religion science both or even neither and in our modern day society where right and wrong is only opinion at least speaking politically correctly the ambiguity is an incentive don t get me wrong as much as it sounds like it contact isn t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film it s a highly enjoyable two and a half hours despite its seemingly heavy issues it s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film the special effects are outstanding though warning highly depreciated on the small screen even so some of the subtle visual effects that will likely go unnoticed by many are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as sci fi the storytelling is rich and complete and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious and at times even hokey it s easily one of the best films and one of the best sci fi films i ve ever seen this is zemeckis best since back to the future and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated zemeckis now has real reason to boast 
most people fit into two different categories you either love woody allen or you hate his guts my family for the most part hates him and his movies i think he s very funny but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of unrestrained by physical boundaries allen s humor comes shining through those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen s intelligent observations of life those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one in a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they d never seen before toy story used state of the art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present many critics will call that a better film but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture antz however has upped the ante considerably disney s a bug s life isn t due out for another two months and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal by beating disney out they have satisfied the audience s thirst for computer animated films but don t let that fool you disney is definitely not scared in the past two years competitions have broken out between studios in it was the volcano duel in my opinion dante s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor both in time and in quality volcano had an original premise but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations in there are twice as many competing films first was the comet competition and armageddon blew away it s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact but now it s even more interesting as one beloved studio disney goes up against the newcomer dreamworks who will prevail time will tell but i m sure that mr mouse has nothing to fear this may sound like i didn t like antz on the contrary i d put it up there with toy story but due to it s pg rating many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn t appear in disney s version some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family oriented film sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally which makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd the humor is also written especially for adults though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended this is the type of film that should be made for families more often entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen s shtick and franz kafka s metamorphosis the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug z allen is a troubled ant believing he was not made to be a worker when you re the middle child in a family of five million he comments about his neglected childhood one night z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing his pathetic place in life in walks princess bala sharon stone whom no one recognizes without a crown bala asks z is he would like to dance and they engage in a pulp fiction esque dance while everyone else is following the leader after discovering that she is the princess z falls in love but there s a problem bala is getting married to general mandible gene hackman a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony in order to do that he must eliminate not only the queen anne bancroft but the weakest of the colony namely the worker ants but to get rid of the queen he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her he and colonel cutter christopher walkin come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle where they will surely be killed the queen is reluctant at first but decides it is best for the colony meanwhile z wants to meet bala again and he asks weaver an army ant to switch places with him so z gets sent off to battle but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites the battle sequence is absolutely stunning though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers which contained a very similar sequence however antz and that film were both in production around the same time so the similarities are merely coincidence the second half of the film revolves around z s kidnapping of bala and their search for a mythical place called insectopia there an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension especially one involving a magnifying glass looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day in fact i m just going to assume that the producers referenced id intentionally the ants look up in awe and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground visually it s an exciting rush of adrenaline but don t be fooled little kids shouldn t see this as they may just try and copy it after seeing antz i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again hopefully children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel as an animated film antz is probably the best you will find to date visually it s as stunning as what dreams may come the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren t limited by gravity they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball however the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy s shoe it s truly a great example of film making at its finest with computer technology the animators have carefully made the ants faces look similar to the actors providing the voices the best example would have to be barbatus danny glover at one point you can even see the pores on his face although i doubt ants have pores do they barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head but a good deal of humor is derived more appropriate for adults of course disney s a bug s life looks good but i don t know if they will be able to best dreamworks newest animated feature in terms of animation if not then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do go head to head with the big mouse and knock him down yes anastasia was good but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature and antz has one of the best line ups seen since toy story in fact it far exceeds that one woody allen has always been funny but here he transcends most of what he s done in the past few years without a body his comic timing is the most noticeable thing in fact i m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability though for the most part stone works best as a dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed up with stone once again is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor not a typecast action star after a snub at the oscars last year stallone is proving himself as the serious or comedic as illustrated here actor that he is gene hackman is superb as the gruff talking general almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns anne bancroft has a minimal role but she s effective nonetheless danny glover has a small role but he does a very very good job dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick euro trash bees both are very unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver although most people won t recognize her voice either many people will recognize grant shaud s voice as the foreman he played miles on the tv show murphy brown this is definitely a huge cast with some high profile names and it will definitely help it s grosses of course you can probably tell where a lot of the million budget went to also directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers though guterman did direct a feature headless but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture tense at times and very funny throughout the two hold this film together like professionals the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults kids will delight in the animation while parents can laugh heartily at the humor most of it will go over young children s heads does that mean you shouldn t take kids to see it not at all they will have a lot of fun watching this one what is great is the themes that are given to us part social commentary part romance story and part moral drama antz gives everyone something to talk about whether it be the animation or the discussions of individualism and community thankfully it s not subtle in either aspects antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie but the violence is what should keep kids at home the battle scene has ants melting in acid and bugs being speared to death and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight but other than that and some sexual innuendos it s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough but it s still advisable to leave really young children at home have i confused you enough if you do take your kids i recommend seeing the film with them because more than likely you ll enjoy it the most 
one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy innocent fun sometimes the stories are compelling sometimes they re not but with the exception of the first film in the series which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces i ve never been bored by any of the enterprise s numerous missions star trek insurrection is no exception the film has gotten some negative reviews a friend of mine actually thinks it s the worst in the series but i m not really sure why it s an exciting often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film some say it s a bit too light and more of a long episode than a film others say the special effects are cheesy and that it s boring i simply enjoyed the film insurrection which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast introduces us to a race of people called the ba ku the ba ku are very old most of them are about three hundred years old but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet of course these peaceful people can t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves leave it up to their archenemies the son a led by ru afo f murray abraham to mess everything up the son a who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable strike a deal with the federation to move the ba ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying that s when captain picard patrick stewart steps in he realizes that moving the ba ku would kill them it also helps that he falls in love with a ba ku woman donna murphy so with his trusty crew picard defies the federation to keep the ba ku in their natural habitat when dealing with a series with as much history as this it s not entirely necessary to re introduce your characters with each episode this is why i believe non fans have a hard time getting into star trek in order to enjoy it one has to understand how to approach it insurrection however does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters stewart is bold as always a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together jonathan frakes who also directed is funny as commander riker a subplot with data brent spiner discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain overacting like crazy frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact insurrection is an exciting film with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation and the result is very pleasing to the eye particularly in the climactic scenes in which the son a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba ku planet the special effects have a clean impressively sharp look if i have any complaint about the film it s that it tries to take a moral stance when it s not very appropriate to do so i don t think it s that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move ba ku in order to save the lives of thousands better yet why couldn t they have co existed insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience with it s inherent camp factor the star trek series doesn t seem well equipped to deal with issues like this i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle 
hollywood has a batting average with elmore leonard adaptations last year s touch was ill conceived and just plain odd but get shorty jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies steven soderburgh master of sex lies and videotape now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery prison double crossing uncut diamonds and oh yeah true love george clooney is the protagonist a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker but for once i didn t want to slap the taste out of his mouth he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant type perfected in hitchcock movies the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other nowhere present is clooney s usual ain t i sexy sneer there s just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty clooney plays a man who s robbed about banks without ever using a gun in the opening scene he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm of course he gets caught so it s not all good it s while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate s albert brooks in a frightful bald wig collection of diamonds in detroit clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans meanwhile there s jennifer lopez unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda she s finally graduated to a worthy role as the u s marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car and lopez makes it a threesome her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney he s covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck and it s a little cramped in there but they manage to make a love connection anyway probably because it s a movie the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir ish crime story the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime and this is no exception although they re not really germane to the plot lopez s relationship with her father dennis farina of get shorty rhames relationship with his christian sister you could call her sister christian and a pop in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it out of sight spans at least three years but has a non linear structure focusing on the jailbreak brooks score and flashing back to earlier times this is a movie with a brain as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves the entire cast does the material justice clooney and lopez coming into their own and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites here s hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch serving america for almost th of a century 
in recent years harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence scowling through the likes of tom clancy s jack ryan series the fugitive and last year s smash air force one that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system apparently it was just lying dormant with ivan reitman s enjoyable romantic comedy adventure six days seven nights the lovable scoundrel is back giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons ford plays quinn harris a carefree and slightly slobby endearingly so pilot in the tropics whose broken down plane crashes in a storm stranding him and his charter new york magazine editor robin monroe anne heche on a deserted island of course the sophisticated robin and the salt of the earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting while some of the lines fall flat the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche both actors who have largely done serious works as of late seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders and they deliver their zingers as weak as they sometimes are with beguiling abandon naturally there s nothing like a life threatening crisis to bring two people together and quinn and robin s warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates granted some conflict needed to be introduced on the island but this tacked on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes but the point is to get the two together and their newfound affection causes complications for both but mostly robin who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank david schwimmer who frantically awaits her return on the home island reitman and old reliable hand at breezy comedies keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action oriented sequences his big accomplishment however is bringing the old smiling ford back as appealing and charismatic as he always is ford hasn t been quite this charming and affable in years he s obviously having a blast and the audience cannot help but have one along with him holding her own is heche whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be as the plane goes down she frantically pops stress pills she can take her lumps physical and otherwise just as well as quinn making her a formidable foil and ideal match formulaic and light as a feather six days seven nights could be cited as a classic example of the summer popcorn movie season s lack of substance it s certainly fluff but it s unpretentious undemanding and most importantly fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach pass the popcorn 
the thirteenth floor the third in what i would call the reality check movie series is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year the matrix and existenz all three made you think made you wonder what is real what isn t and if our world is just a huge game the thirteenth floor doesn t reach the level of originality creativity and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz but it certainly gives a great shot at it in the matrix we were told that the humans are simply a virus in existenz we learned that our life could be just a game in the thirteenth floor we learn that we are just electronic devices living under another world of electronic devices there is just one world on top of another and everything in them are fake and electronically generated the thirteenth floor took a huge risky turn that i didn t expect it to take and i m not very sure it was such a great turn to make rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller played by armin mueller stahl douglas hall played by craig bierko a man that worked under fuller for many years must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using to the year which consists of computer generated characters only the simulation of is just like it was back in the olden days all of the people involved are just characters or are they douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours and killed fuller along the way douglas interacts with many different potential suspects and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller jane fuller played wonderfully by a talented young actress gretchen mol the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going and doesn t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer s interests i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz and i wouldn t enjoy it but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film unfortunately many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened the scenes that aren t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere leaving you wondering what is the point of this sometimes it was hard to believe that this story with terrible dialogue some bad acting especially from craig bierko and scenes that go absolutely nowhere are actually true i know this isn t a true story or anything but a film should be able to make you think that it is on the plus side of acting we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in actor armin mueller stahl in the thirteenth floor he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances another plus is gretchen mol s realistic performance creating her character with depth not just staying in the one dimensional phase don t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile and shuts you down like any other movie would thrills chills and spills aren t what you will get in this film but you will just get another trip to send your mind on scrambling it until you ve had enough the bottom line let s hope this is the last of the reality check based movies for awhile

every year every year at the festival i wait for that film to come along that one that just pulls me out of my seat sticks its face up next to my nose and roars sur prise into my bewildered visage it s almost always a surprise it sure as niflheim was this time amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason and in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale where we roll our eyes occasionally smirk to ourselves and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a boy i wish that could happen sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash another e t another short circuit this film floored me for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough and presents itself well enough to make it more of an american folk tale with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time america has always had its mythical heros its paul bunyans and john waynes this film presents us with more general but still universal ideals the honest innocent children who have their own inner wisdom the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage honor and love for their respective sport the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding but has the grit to get things done when they need doin does the latter sound familiar amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters but it never leaves you with the feeling that it s artificial that it stands behind glass or that any sharp breeze or more importantly sharp thought will shatter the wax facade of the panorama this is a very sturdy scenario the principals are always given dialogue and always give performances always it just blows me away which made them seem real yet enforces their particular mythic role the writer producer david field seems to literally take all the yeah but in real life this would have happen thoughts you get in your head sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading in a stronger way then before astounding he uses obstacles to the plot to enforce it i am truly impressed indeed envious with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay it s so very unusual especially in a hollywood film i don t want to give too much away but the basic premise is that chuck joshua zuehlke the little league pitcher decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete a boston basketball player alex english amazing grace smith and well i m leaving it at that because i wouldn t spoil this film for you for the world let me just say this though i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply i don t give a rat s ass for the political point of view this film expresses one way or another i m recommending you go see this film because and only because it s an excellent story told with excellence no i don t believe what happens in this film could happen in real life while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted i believe in careful negotiations mutual verification etc screw what i think the point is this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen this is the natural and more all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion and a much better script to boot it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood and more importantly without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self consciousness special kudos to both zuehlke a real life little league pitcher who was picked for the part and english a forward for the denver nuggets for their seamless personification of their characters jamie lee curtis who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing s manager and friend william l peterson in a big change from his role in to live and die in l a as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it and gregory peck as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was and who some numbskulls still probably think he is 
i like movies with albert brooks and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films which are finding their way into theaters the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with but even if we can t brooks has the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won t find an albert brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will put simply brooks comedy is intelligent mother is albert brooks latest film and it does not disappoint brooks plays john henderson a middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce he makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably he then has dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life jeff has a good job a loving family and most of all a warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds after dinner john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is in comparison beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him and john gives it right back to her at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john s life she says i love you and john replies with i know you think you do the thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading it s the kind that goes something like yes dear i think you do that wonderfully but it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy there s always the big but john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is a great experiment he calls it brooks own brand of humor really shines in this film especially in the interaction john has with his mother there s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother s house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you don t want to stay at a hotel she still doesn t get it and it is absolutely hilarious in the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over when john points out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice asks john he s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as a twenty pound block of cheese the freezer was a good invention says john but it s not supposed to be used for everything that s why it s smaller than the refrigerator it s something most of us find strangely familiar brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur for example in defending your life his and meryl streep s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion when they re finished and walk out brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside you don t know what the joke was because you couldn t hear him during the entire scene but i must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context in this film brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene i don t want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past john s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we as the audience learn right along with him his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but as john spends more time with her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way on screen brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world in a way he s very much like yosarian of catch expect with something of an attitude casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect she assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking a little slowly and is just so adorable it s hard to get mad at her character this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her as his first choice brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer s disease that may be just as well since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother s favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as a mama s boy the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes a solid connection is not really made between john s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother additionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this beatrice you must think i m some kind of moron john no i think your someone who thinks i m a moron beatrice well it takes one to know one 
 through a spyglass i could see everything king louis xvi was beheaded on january but instead of visualizing this act of regicide legendary auteur eric rohmer s the lady and the duke observes from afar consider it a view to a kill made abstract a proper british yes british gentlewoman grace elliott lucy russell and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope often muttering i don t know as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air what we don t see might not be able to hurt us just close your eyes and think of england during times of revolution the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them adapted from elliott s memoirs journal of my life during the french revolution rohmer s latest artistic tour de force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies tales of the four seasons etc a period film set during the most violent changes in french history resisting the temptation for grand scale theatrics much of the lady and the duke is about quiet decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist a headstrong snobbish blueblood one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own grace s life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover the king s hot blooded cousin prince philipe duke of orleans jean claude dreyfus the times are changing though and the gears inch ever closer toward violence during the september massacres of she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke s sister in law on a stake rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil old fashioned almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob in doing so he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not the face of death when grace sees her friend s disembodied head on a pole rohmer s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman s reaction shot laden with hot tears grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice sheltering him from the mob through her relationship with the duke she seeks a passport for this one activist s escape grace doesn t even understand her own actions and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers ceaseless police monitoring house searches even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life her imperious attitude to the servants never changes she becomes a heroine through circumstance the events themselves are intrusions upon her person her home and therefore her values aristocracy proves a glass house one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones the duke is called to vote on the king s punishment and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors talk means nothing in the face of bloody action or futile inaction the episodic structure creates a wobbly jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification lazy viewers and critics may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke that s foolery but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer s characters occasionally become didactic rohmer s imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism the actors were filmed against a bluescreen then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of th century paris this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide open streets it looks as phony as titanic but unlike james cameron s debacle the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone why they aren t real the very foundation rohmer s characters stand upon is false and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves in all their insubstantial glory screened at the new york film festival feature coming soon 
one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length if a film is only minutes but feels like minutes then it s crap but if a film last hours and feels like minutes then it s excellent boogie nights falls into the latter catagory the director anderson delivers a funny hip yet sometimes violent film which flies along mark whalberg a k a marky mark plays eddie adams a seventeen year old with a certain gift in the midriff area jack horner reynolds is a adult film director who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business after running away from home eddie joins jack changes his name to dirk diggler and starts making erotic movies in the movie business dirk meets a whole load of characters which the film introduces very quickly and slickly such as scotty phillip seymour hoffman rollergirl graham amber moore and floyd phillip baker hall and little bill william h macy all the characters are well written well played and the audience gets to know them pretty well thanks to the excellent script we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce rollergirls hard time at school and little bills wife who sleeps with everyone except her husband but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing the direction is fast thrilling and never holds up there are some great shots some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences and lots of other neat directional touches the writing is fabulous with some intelligent dialogue some funny dialogue but none of the dialogue is crap like most hollywood films such as the lost world jurassic park or tommorow never dies boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing on par and sometimes betters quentin tarantino s films resevoir dogs and pulp fiction the soundtrack is also excellent like american graffiti the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack which heightens the atmosphere and gives the film an extra lift also the costumes are great the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties the film although excellent does have some flaws firstly wahlberg although excellent cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry in both scenes where he has to act angry his acting is so off the scenes tension and anger is lost but the rest of the cast are excellent burt reynolds is brilliant julianne moore shows real emotion and william h macy is great aswell but he always is another flaw with the film though is that the ending seems a bit tacked on it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit and needed to wrap up quickly it s a shame really as the rest of the film is perfectly paced but they re small niggles really boogie nights is an excellent film superb directing writing acting and music all combine to make one spectacular film whatever you do do not miss out on boogie nights 
films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success whether they re about superheroes batman superman spawn or geared toward kids casper or the arthouse crowd ghost world but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before for starters it was created by alan moore and eddie campbell who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid s with a part series called the watchmen to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd the book or graphic novel if you will is over pages long and includes nearly more that consist of nothing but footnotes in other words don t dismiss this film because of its source if you can get past the whole comic book thing you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors albert and allen hughes getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in well anything but riddle me this who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society the ghetto in question is of course whitechapel in london s east end it s a filthy sooty place where the whores called unfortunates are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision when the first stiff turns up copper peter godley robbie coltrane the world is not enough calls in inspector frederick abberline johnny depp blow to crack the case abberline a widower has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium upon arriving in whitechapel he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly heather graham say it isn t so and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper so i won t go into the particulars here other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay in the comic they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper but screenwriters terry hayes vertical limit and rafael yglesias les mis rables do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because after all an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days who holds back the electric car who made steve guttenberg a star don t worry it ll all make sense when you see it now onto from hell s appearance it s certainly dark and bleak enough and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did at times it seems like sleepy hollow the print i saw wasn t completely finished both color and music had not been finalized so no comments about marilyn manson but cinematographer peter deming don t say a word ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic oscar winner martin childs shakespeare in love production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place even the acting in from hell is solid with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent ians holm joe gould s secret and richardson dalmatians log in great supporting roles but the big surprise here is graham i cringed the first time she opened her mouth imagining her attempt at an irish accent but it actually wasn t half bad the film however is all good r for strong violence gore sexuality language and drug content 
in tim burton s sleepy hollow there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe burton s update on washington irving s classic tale of the legend of sleepy hollow offers us the mystery of the horseman when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror writer andrew kevin walker seven throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine as sleepy hollow opens we re greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau who won an oscar in burton s ed wood landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow who on a fateful carriage ride through the forest is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town constable ichabod crane johnny depp is sent in to investigate landlord baltus von tassel michael gambon explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods crane is not a man of great superstition and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie first and foremost sleepy hollow is a fun horror film as with virtually all burton movies we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly the horseman f x are stylish and impressive particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors but why did i enjoy sleepy hollow as much as i did although enjoyable it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right it was the light comic touch that burton applied the film has the sweetness of a candy apple usually channeled through depp s wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane who is no longer a mild mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities this is certainly not the only alteration that s been made as the film progresses it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together because for the audience it s not an issue we particularly wish to be solved it s more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive still we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton s keen eye to capture our attention the costuming is exceptional and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout it s recognizable that the script was refined by award winning playwright tom stoppard the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel s daughter katrina and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent walken michael gough who appeared in burton s batman films and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles i suppose the strengths behind sleepy hollow lie within the central trio director burton constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy all of this is not to be taken seriously of course sleepy hollow is a lavish frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children if you ve got a decent head on your shoulders you ll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time 
plot a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side but this new guy is not like all the others he s got ambition he s got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster violence lots of swearing and betrayals ensue critique a very good serious minded unique british gangster flick which misses the great mark by way of an annoying voice over popping up throughout the film and a so so ending here s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix okay so it s not entirely new but it s definitely original when all put together as done here the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place it s and these dudes are looking good yes it s all about the suits fellas the italian shoes the cufflinks the ties and the birds that s ladies for those uninitiated hanging around you here are a bunch of horrible men gangsters if you will looking sharp talking shit and busting heads all over the place but that s not the basis of this movie the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group the excellent david thewlis and one of his cronies paul bettany also extremely good in this film and how the power sex appeal and coolness of one affects the other you know how there are always these hanger on gangster types who latch on to the godfathers the leaders the top dogs of every crime organization well most of the time these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person that is their boss so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence but this film brings the betrayals the messed up loyalties the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package of course director paul mcguigan isn t trying to be guy ritchie here and doesn t over stylize his presentation jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix nope he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty look into my eyes in fact the last time that i ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers miller s crossing scary shite but there s an ever better scene than that in this film this one features bettany once again slowly torturing hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster from that man s point of view but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes one by one that s right he does the guy in his underwear that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman but the flick s not perfect in fact i didn t mind malcolm mcdowell s voice over narration at first but as the film grew into a major flashback most of the film is presented as such he came in every now and then and rarely added anything of interest to the plot all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c word umpteen times and even described one scene as it was happening so i opened the door then went up the lift etc it s like yeah i know that already i could see it on the screen overdone i also didn t quite buy the ending of the movie which despite being original seemed a little unbelievable especially when you consider that it s supposed to be taking place years later and folks still seem to be holding grudges still in love still living in the same apartments i mean c mon it s years man i don t know somehow it didn t work all that well for me but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies and this one is a decent addition to the lot forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell s narration of the obvious plot points and concentrate on the film s stronger attributes such as its style the exquisite atmosphere of the time period its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads bettany and thewlis incidentally unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films it s the real deal note this film is packed with strong accents all around which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time it s also quite violent and i don t remember any film that used the c word as much as this one so leave the kids at home for this one where s joblo coming from american psycho a clockwork orange donnie brasco fight club get carter godfather godfather ii goodfellas lock stock two smoking barrels pulp fiction reservoir dogs

there s a moment in schindler s list when a number of jews are trudging through snow clean and crisp dark edges and frost on the ground one girl waltzes through wearing a red dress that stings the eyes it is probably the finest moment through out the film when i first saw it i began to cry though i could not say why this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground so black and murky its almost pomegranate red at another time we follow a young boy as he runs searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet which is already occupied like so citizen kane fargo the godfather the godfather part ii greed many of the greatest american films schindler s list plays with the concepts of money power and soul but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing starkly emotional and brutally powerful schindler s list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings the following that it has gained is not suprising this is probably thus far the best film of the decade steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks jaws the indiana jones films and e t but it wasn t until that we saw what a brilliant man he can be the product of his genuis is really something to see it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you throughout we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads we watch oskar schindler liam neeson grow from an arrogant self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment the film requires much work and can be a harrowing experience go expecting a quick entertainment and you ll be bitterly dissapointed it does reward the patient viewer this is a mature spielberg and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece this eqsuisite beautiful film is a rare gem it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies it leaves one breathless uplifted and with much to think about afterwards you can reflect on individual images visions and people laconic removed schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all does much and leaves feeling as if he could should have done more then he did and was able to the change seems natural in the hands of a lesser filmmaker it would be crude and would cheat the audience instead we are told a tale told a story the film is punishing to watch yes but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle and a genuine masterpiece of a movie 
scream has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well during a film class discussion windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are and why sequels never live up to the originals a few rare exceptions are noted but they left out one scream s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america a sequel was unavoidable but luckily the re teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment in fact at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream i would say that scream might even be the better film sidney prescott neve campbell the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro ca in the original scream is now two years older and off to college majoring in theater meanwhile tv journalist gale weathers courtney cox who covered the murders in the first film has since written a book about the dreadful events a book titled stab which has been developed into a major motion picture as scream opens a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of stab and before long a young couple are butchered to death unnoticed in the midst of hysteria this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown copycat sets out to repeat what s been done and finish what hasn t of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film and yes movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds but this is a sequel and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies this is in large part due to williamson s deliciously written script which will easily leave you satisfied as much as the film condemns the use of cliches it is riddled with them but it is done so effectively and with skillful direction by craven that you re not bound to complain i will note however that the whodunit did wind up being the first person i suspected but believe me i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie all the actors outdo themselves here we re not talking oscar performances but cambell cox david arquette as dewey riley and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing the characters remain true to their roots and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years we can see how the events in the first film has affected them but we don t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place the nice thing about scream is that it doesn t seem off kilter from it s predecessor it s a natural smooth and believable as far as horror films go transition from film to film we skip two years but there doesn t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks it flows so well that you feel more like you re reading chapter two of a book long chapters eh than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels scream s entire plot structure correlates completely with the first making for immediate fondness and absorption as i said before scream easily lives up to if not surpassing it s precursor the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream is because it was the first this doesn t mean that it overcasts the unique whimsical humor or overall caliber of it s sequel it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it s own while maintaining it s sought after qualities if ever a film followed it s original so well it would be scream and it makes this a definite must see for all those unbridled scream fans out there scream fits snugly alongside scream and will hopefully receive as many high remarks it would top off the series quite well if it weren t for the fact that two movies don t really make a series it s unlikely to assume that a scream won t appear in the next few years but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror trilogy let s hope they can keep up the fantastic work like they say don t mess with perfection but when a money making smash hit is almost guaranteed who s gonna listen 
here s a word analogy amistad is to the lost world as schindler s list is to jurassic park in after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit many critics described schindler s list as the director s penance as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd pleasing blockbuster now after a three year layoff spielberg is back with a vengeance once again his summer release was special effects loaded action adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers now following his pattern he has fashioned another serious inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity that film is amistad although not as masterful as schindler s list amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture thematically rich impeccably crafted and intellectually stimulating the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact watching schindler s list was a powerful almost spiritual experience spielberg pulled us into the narrative absorbed us in the drama then finally let us go exhausted and shattered three plus hours later aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since amistad while a fine example of film making is not as transcendent the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books but considering who writes the texts that s not a surprise however the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric and while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account most of the basic facts are in order several mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film s dramatic force on the whole while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired one stormy night during the summer of the men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape led by the lion hearted cinque djimon hounsou they take control of the vessel killing most of the crew adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey they are tricked however and the la amistad which makes its way northward off the united states eastern coastline is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison charged with murder and piracy the first men to come to the africans defense are abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard they are soon joined by roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey a property attorney of little repute aided by advice from former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for and his central argument that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men not property convinces the judge but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin s cause current president martin van buren nigel hawthorne eager to please southern voters and year old queen isabella of spain anna paquin begins pulling strings behind the scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free at its heart amistad is a tale of human courage cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to he is a free man not a slave and while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle he will not give it up effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies they are individuals and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie s success to amplify this point spielberg presents many scenes from the africans point of view detailing their occasionally humorous observations about some of the white man s seemingly strange rituals the larger struggle is of course one of defining humanity as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as sub human so the pro slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense the abolitionists regard the africans as men but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property in a sense the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war which would break out less than three decades later looming over everything amistad s presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history four claimants come forward against the africans the state which wants them tried for murder the queen of spain who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american spanish treaty two american naval officers who claim the right of high seas salvage and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad who demand that their property be returned to them baldwin must counter all of these claims while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier they gradually learn to communicate aside from cinque who is a fully realized individual characterization is spotty but the acting is top notch matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his pretty boy image to become baldwin but the lawyer is never particularly well defined outside of his role in the la amistad case likewise while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan they are never anything more than abolitionists nigel hawthorne who played the title character in the madness of king george presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election finally there s anthony hopkins whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done hopkins who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer an emotionally crippled english butler and richard nixon makes us believe that he is adams his ten minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler s list is this film s lack of a well defined human villain schindler s list had ralph fiennes superbly realized amon goeth who was not only a three dimensional character but a personification of all that the nazis stood for there is no such figure in amistad the villain is slavery but an ideology no matter how evil is rarely the best adversary it is to spielberg s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist amistad s trek to the screen which encountered some choppy waters author barbara chase riboud has cried plagiarism a charge denied by the film makers comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has but one thing is certain with spielberg s rousing substantive film leading the way the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history 
seen december at p m at the crossgates mall cinema guilderland ny theater with matt perreault and my sister jena for free matt paid using pre paid passes if there s ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non stop action the james bond films are it and if there s ever been a james bond film that not only proves this but does so by pushing it to the extreme tomorrow never dies is it opening sequences almost always make or break action films when done properly not only are they actually exciting but they foreshadow things to come this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie but with a sense of the self aware enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in first there s a high tech slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly chinese waters there s definite tension as there seems to be an unknown but certainly hostile third party involved who is manipulating both sides when the scene ends in tragedy it s clear there s some kind of powerful conspiracy going on and who else to call on for such a case but james bond the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond brosnon as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious bond is clearly and obviously depicted as an out and out hero he single handedly takes out a small army of terrorists and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for over using but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly it s not about the payoff because it s obvious bond will escape instead it s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it all the while creating for witty hysterical comedy it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore because of political correctness and just plain copping out on behalf of the filmmakers even the term villain sounds passe what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come yet making him seem completely plausible jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant cunning elliot carver a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world that is through his massive media empire not through nuclear weapons through some interesting detective work bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news not only is that an original idea for a conflict but one which could carry over into reality surprisingly this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become the film s hook is the action and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way the story works much like bond himself always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot somehow a chinese agent wai lin yeoh bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid but also works because of this not in spite of it the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story although tomorrow never dies is far from perfect it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue 
brian depalma needs a hit really badly since scoring big with the untouchables in depalma has seen casualties of war raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames consequently it would be easy enough to consider carlito s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma reteaming with al pacino scarface and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes it doesn t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn carlito s way while hampered by depalma s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism is a truly tense and engrossing drama carlito brigante pacino is a life long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance in carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality he declares himself reformed tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld penn carlito s crooked attorney and childhood friend and bodyguard pachanga luis guzman carlito rediscovers old flame gail penelope ann miller and seems ready to retire in peace old ways die hard though and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can t seem to shake carlito s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film in the first carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station both highlight depalma s gift for choreographed mayhem and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely yet for all the viscera i found the character study even more compelling carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera there s more of an immediacy to carlito s way an ever present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion you sense that there s no way after so many years that carlito can stay out of trouble indeed he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart you don t get reformed you just run out of wind pacino captures carlito s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy sean penn is even better turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder he could have been simply pathetic a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink making the moment he goes over quite jolting as compelling as the narrative is viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms like a degree swing around a kiss vertigo via body double and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables from a story standpoint there s an obligatory love story with a cliche d long suffering girlfriend character penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn t do anything new with the role and eventually she becomes just a distraction never integrated fully enough into the story still it s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn t break carlito s way plays like a tragic novel deliberate confident and powerful those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well rewarded 
plot a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention the boys eventually get together to split the money but as plans change double crosses occur dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road who s on the up and up who s the real bad guy and who s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie critique the funnest movie that i ve seen so far this year it s got style it s got tough guys talkin shite and it s got plenty of bullets to go around a definite hunk a hunk a burnin adventure a guy s guy movie through and through and one that ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff it s not very original it goes on for a little too long but costner and russell make it happen as two shite kickin elvis lovers who don t stop till they more or less drop this movie s got some pretty intensive shoot out scenes one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i ve ever witnessed featuring several elvises with guns a blazin and the king s music playing in the background and a decent helping of double crosses sharp dialogue and funny moments in fact even though the cast is filled with many name actors b actors as they might be for the most part most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim but the true glue that holds this film together other than the spirit of elvis himself is costner and russell who play their badass characters to the t sure russell s been down this road before but costner surprised me with his nastiness i guess he s pissed at all the box office bombs that he s been in of late but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here in the end the bottom line with this movie is having fun kickin ass and making sure there s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards and smoke em if you got em folks there is also this one really great show down scene between costner and a cop that ll have you crackin up and lovin it all at the same time the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background with plenty and i mean plenty of camera tricks cuts and edits but for this kind of flick it actually works the film is not perfect though it starts off with a pretty big bang but then pulls a way of the gun on us and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle while characters intermingle and disperse i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega hot in the movie no okay well i just did i coulda done without her whole romance angle but to be honest it doesn t take up much of the film which is generally covered in blood explosions guts and elvis nods try to see how many inside connections to the king you can guess of course it s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind i also like these types of guy movies a lot and even though the film doesn t bring much originality to the table it does offer a pretty coherent story some nice twists and turns humor and a big ol helping of whoop ass coming straight from costner and russell s respective boots probably not a film for everyone but definitely for those who enjoy the guns the charismatic bad guys and a fun if entirely disposable adventure now see how many elvis songs i ve used to pun my way through this phony review below the elvis songs also recommend this movie so whether you re lonesome tonight or any other night remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets leave your little sister at home bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse cause this movie ain t one to return to the sender i really beg of you whether you re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender and no suspicious minds either folks cause i got stung by this movie i mean it really shook me up and unless you re the devil in disguise himself i think you won t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either so don t be cruel don t turn away don t curl up with your latest flame tonite whether she be a hard headed woman or not and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film it s now or never folks trust me i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i d seen so far this year is far behind me joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building thank you thank you very much where s joblo coming from get carter heat honeymoon in vegas payback reindeer games reservoir dogs way of the gun 
did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward with a comatose sunny von bulow she is the main narrator of the film in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder the dramatic trick works as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder sex unhappiness and a lawyer s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win jeremy irons is claus von bulow in what is his finest role and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history he is as hated as any man alive as cold as a cucumber his remorse for his wife s comatose condition is nonexistant and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas the background to the case is such during christmas of sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke the same situation occured in only sunny never woke and probably never will when examined it was found that she had times the normal amount of insulin within her blood claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson convicted and freed on bail he immediately hires alan dershowitz the renowed harvard law professor to acquit him ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him we follow him through two very different cases the case of the johnson case where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn t commit and von bulow who he still hasn t figured out dershowitz doesn t know what happened to sunny and he is extremely hesitant to take the case nevertheless he does based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him together with a group of law students dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed silver s performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film schroeder directs on many different levels with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz there are flaws at times the film gets overly theatrical yet due to glenn close s troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well the flashbacks are good but at times schroeder doesn t fill in the blanks the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film and it could have used a better ending the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly without any intelligent conclusion the supporting characters are often neglected and dershowitz s team should have been allowed to grow character wise but schroeder over simplifies the story and the characters yet for all these flaws the film is deeply engrossing because of irons as von bulow he is brutally evil anti semitic prejudiced arrogant protective he is a rotten lying monster whose conviction may have been wrong legally but morally he was to blame irons plays him to a cold perfection with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder however the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife s death by years of neglect and coldness however legally did he do the murder schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind with all the character flaws reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent he wants the viewer to make up his own mind schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow in death for all the failed dramatic theatrics this is one that works beautifully we don t know what happened that sense of legal ambiguousness along with von bulow s obvious moral guilt is why reversalf fortune works in the end von bulow is as sadistic as ever irons is haunting and that is why reversal of fortune is so good 
john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles so effortlessly that people tend to forget he s there much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors example the other day my mother asked me the expert of course if there were any movies out worth seeing never mind that our tastes couldn t be more divergent i ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go was a lot of fun which it is so i didn t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation i muttered with a little trepidation that she might enjoy high fidelity she responded with her usual query whose in that one this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people usually of the jewish faith fretting about in some upper east side palace anyway when i answered john cusack she replied with a rather stunned who as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin but i suppose it s understandable that she would not recognize the name after all for most names are tougher than faces i showed her a picture of cusack s mug in the paper hoping for an oh him yes he s quite good instead i got a no i don t know him at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger yes filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone till i realized something i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack s relatively bland visage or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise one syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car cu sack cu sack no not quite as cool i m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as the guy from add in the cusack film of your choice he s not a brand name and his movies usually aren t big moneymakers but in his own unassuming way he s kind of a genius with his pleasant common man looks and charming semi articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the s from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it the schlumpy every man he s a constantly enjoyable screen persona like albert brooks or woody allen and he knows how to chose scripts while the stephan baldwin s and val kilmer s seem to put them selves in everything the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent cusack generally picks rewarding projects save for the unwatchable hot pursuit a film also featuring a young ben stiller high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears the grifters the hi lo country and it s a hit it was also co written by cusack and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy grosse point blank it s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film but as it progresses in its meandering fashion the movie cast something of a spell over me high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non committal rob a vinyl record store owner who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his top break ups list this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller s day off at first the talking directly into the camera schtick had me vaguely annoyed mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack s witty delivery he s the kind of guy we don t mind talking directly to us gradually the film settles into a shampoo like tragi comic character study of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is yes it s all very existential though that plot line is mostly enjoyable the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters all of whom now this is really something are terrific enough to warrant their own films the best of which is jack black of the very funny show tenacious d a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis hair unfortunately that annoying smirk remains an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy he s the kind of guy i m sure we ve all met before a blowhard who thinks he s always right and will do anything in his power be it yell argue insult to hoist his opinion onto others but i like this guy because of how black plays him the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak which might be a bit of a redundant description seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic he s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister but fears and black never let that happen the character for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality he s over the top but in a way we can all probably relate to catherine zeta jones in her brief role gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own charm tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age type a character played entirely for cartoon yuks but still manages to work its desired comic effect the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle mifune who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent replacing it with a stilted american phonation i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role but instead of being likeable she comes across as rather robotic and as such it s hard to see why cusack s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful intelligent writer natasha gregson wagner potentially waiting in the wings this reminded me of say anything where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood whose unbelievably more wooden then father clint for those special people whose wheels turn a little slower in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his though i d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles the result would be more effective high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances fears direction is somewhat stilted and the script is sometimes a little too and this is a word i m beginning to hate to use but alas i must quirky for its own good i think i ll blame that on scott rosenberg who judging from what he did with beautiful girls con air and things to do in denver while your dead has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie but cusack really does deserve an award for being so damn cusackian i m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent his character rob whose sort of like an older more bitter lloyd from say anything is funny and tragic without being pathetic and that cusack can do all this and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences is something of an achievement 
showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry spiced tabasco sauce a dish not to everyone s taste but certainly a well crafted movie possibly that movie s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the characters future so there was no need to film it there was actually about four hours worth of screen story there but eszterhas found ways to get it all on screen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent characters we have shows for the eyes and the ears plotlines that play on several levels we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable and we have a story of an innocent who may not be so innocent who s trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slips into behaving the way those around her do but recovers with a flourish and quits a winner in this sense the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven who s not known for treating his characters well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in a positive way and we re left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movies but it s far better than we d been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in and in the last quarter century has pushed farther and farther experimenting with the socially acceptable limits to movie making his most recent three movies robocop total recall and basic instinct have been a progression of back door access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives and now he s exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating although his original version is available on video many reviewers have taken the politically correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies it s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common and why such an environment should exist it s about the scum who use other people as power trip toys and the need to escape their power it s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don t pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment an nc movie which isn t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been a good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator if anything it s a rape scene with a victim who s been duped into cooperation you don t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors you don t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed and you don t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls and in an awful lot of vegas shows an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity showgirls de glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness nomi is played in a very good performance by elizabeth berkley who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who s at the end of her rope desperate to live a life better than the one she s known she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker trying to be something better than she seems destined to be when nomi realizes she s gone too far for too little she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be gina rivera plays molly a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi providing her with what may be the one solid positive relationship in nomi s entire life molly is the one who makes the difference and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she ll be using for the rest of her life and nomi s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi s decision gina gershon plays cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer a reflexively competitive manipulator who s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch a fading talent made bitter by self awareness her character is very well drawn and performed in a major scene in a hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence passes the torch to nomi the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe molly is an honest hard working person who means well and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality cristal is a talented dancer who s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co operating part of the system exchanging self respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas nomi believes she can make it without selling herself succumbs to a degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and doesn t need las vegas or its brand of stardom the male parts in this movie are simply props they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs camouflaged as a nice guy glenn plummer plays a dancer who s working as a bellboy and provides a bit of alternate perspective plummer s character is the only one in the movie who s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art but even he s succumbed to the cult of manipulation plummer s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie some of jost vacano s cinematography is fantastic and one particular delineation of nomi s character alteration a no dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting is utterly terrifying this movie is rated nc due to language sexual situations full frontal nudity violence and probably the costuming as well i don t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie making but don t go see it if you re not in a tough mood the only person it s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i c u on life support and there is probably not one character in this movie you d enjoy meeting in person 
meteor threat set to blow away all volcanoes twisters summer is here again this season could probably be the most ambitious season this decade with hollywood churning out films like deep impact godzilla the x files armageddon the truman show all of which has but one main aim to rock the box office leading the pack this summer is deep impact one of the first few film releases from the spielberg katzenberg geffen s dreamworks production company following the rather dismal showing of their previous two releases mousehunt and amistad deep impact shines with elements which could just make it one of the biggest movies of the year deep impact begins with the discovery of an earth bound comet during a school astronomy outing by leo beiderman elijah wood which subsequently stirred up the political community of the world keeping the information under wraps to prevent widespread panic president beck morgan freeman took it upon himself and his subordinates to execute a highly secretive space project to destroy the comet before it hits earth while pursuing a sex scandal story amongst the presidential ranks ambitious up and coming reporter jenny lerner tea leoni unfolds the wool that president beck has pulled over the citizens of the world as if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of mankind is not enough jenny has to come to terms with her father maximillian schell leaving the mother for a younger woman president beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the comet exactly one year later with so much confidence that it left no trace of panic within the american community achieving fame from announcement of the comet wolf beiderman en route to earth the name of its discoverers leo beiderman continues life in his small town as a young celebrity a team of astronauts led by the ageing veteran astronaut spurgeon tanner robert duvall was secretly trained to carry out the mission to land on the comet and create and explosion with a nuclear device with the hope of blowing it out of its current path towards earth despite him being the most experienced in the team the younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts tanner s ability due to his age but these are just problems of individuals life on earth goes on as any other day confident that the comet will be destroyed when the attempt to avert wolf beiderman s path failed and caused the comet to split into two comet wolf and comet beiderman the president unfolds his contingency plan to evacuate part of the population leaving the rest to die citizens are randomly chosen to live underground for years prior to impact when the dust due to the impact around earth have settled by then all life on the surface would have died jenny and leo were picked but many of their loved ones were not only a handful of earth s population will be saved from destruction deep impact s moving moments occur in the least special effect laced scenes while the effects are fantastic they only form a small part of the film which indulges itself in the development of its main characters leo lerner and tanner leo s struggle when he learns that his girlfriend is not part of the population to be saved lerner s dwindling relationship with her father and her pain for the mother s loneliness tanner s strive to gain the respect he deserves from his crew and his ultimate sacrifice all form the backbone of deep impact s moving moments deep impact smells suspiciously like the previous year release contact despite vivid differences i think its probably because they both delve in a story of global proportions and indulges in the premise of hope faith and life itself both do not depend heavily on eye candy in the form of cgi effects director mimi leder who won numerous awards directing television series and made her debut with peacekeeper last year is definitely a director to watch despite this being the first of the two meteor movies this summer the other being armageddon i think there will be stark differences in the approach to the subject matter while the premise of both may be the same execution and focus of the films will in fact show that deep impact has more focus on human elements than armageddon which is done by the team which brought us bad boys crimson tide and the rock deep impact should be able to satisfy a variety of audiences from the most action craving to those who just want to immerse into its manipulative but nonetheless dramatic premise 
for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and high art the son s room is an inventive subtle alternative written by directed and starring nanni moretti it takes us through the slow complicated path of bereavement slow is the best description for the film at first it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal happy family father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities they laugh spend free time together and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome but suddenly the son is found to be dead after a diving accident the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it but can also be trying on the attention span though the film drags and even repeats itself this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production it doesn t come across as a vanity piece one might wish he hadn t picked the profession of analyst for the father giovanni which he stars as if only because this makes his character s reactions so predictable what saves it is a well written script with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative or that remind a depressed person of loss you start to take notice of the cracked dishes ignored when familial bliss was in full swing you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block and not necessarily huge events like graduation even better are the role reversals that take place within the household while giovanni and paola laura morante do check up on their daughter irene jasmine trinca there is a sense of being on autopilot not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more she ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic unexpected change respectfully gender issues never enter the picture self propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama speeches and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing in contrast the son s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning denial depression anger bargaining acceptance through each of its main characters it s not the most engaging minutes but it is certainly easy to relate to 
 when will the devil take me he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over the spoiled title character of onegin pronounced oh negg in is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour martha fiennes debut feature is quite literally filmed poetry it s based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin a profound study of regret of how we confuse shame with guilt when we first meet eugene onegin ralph acting for his sister another brother magnus composed the score a philandering aristocrat from st petersburg he has just inherited his uncle s estate with plans to sell it onegin pays a summer visit to the manor which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods smitten with olga larina headey he befriends olga s fianc vladimir lensky stephens while olga s sister tatyana tyler romanticizing his flippant attitude he s a nineteenth bad boy falls for onegin in one sweaty inky torrent of passion tatyana writes him a love letter he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections it is implied because he can soon after tragedy strikes and onegin makes himself scarce when we catch up with him six years later he has just returned to st petersburg where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend donovan has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana this time onegin finds her irresistable what is most amazing about ralph fiennes performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch overwhelmed by a top hat the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now there s room to breathe in a role that s made up of shades of gray like onegin petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in parking lot you don t know what you ve got til it s gone onegin s about face on tatyana speaks for those of us read most of us who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse embarrassment even at having let her go out of identification we feel empathy for onegin a callous bastard tatyana s emotions echo a thousand ditties but that makes them no less vital she changes too from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co stars filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares they both have faces mr fiennes and ms tyler capable of conveying archetypal russian misery onegin could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of masterpiece theater even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact were martha fiennes not at the helm an mtv background she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others has positively influenced her sense of pace though thankfully not her shot lengths no spasmodic cutting here at just over minutes onegin clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair the film has an atypical period look as well absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions the sets are almost expressionistically bare echoing the loneliness of the protagonists cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them i m reminded the climax which unfolds in a sea of white martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema and her spare often painfully human visual presentation of yevgeny onegin is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin s difficult text yet ms fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion 
just look back two years ago at the coen brothers comedic gem the big lebowski change the actors take away the bowling alley add a record store and you ve got high fidelity or maybe the other way around since nick hornby s novel high fidelity came first either way it s been done before a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances yet it remains consistently funny why is this maybe because you know your life is much better than this you know these guys are more pathetic than you are and you know its ok to laugh at them because they re fictional director stephen frears possibly not intentionally has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day when watching high fidelity expect to laugh at someone else s pain realize what you are laughing at and then laugh again i laughed at dick todd louiso the shy timorous steve buscemi character of lebowski who seems to know what he is talking about but either can t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends i laughed at the john goodman character barry jack black an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons pudgy egotistic and obnoxious at the same time and i laughed at rob john cusack the jeff bridges type whom the story revolves around rob is the character easiest to relate to but he is nothing like you at all he uncontrollably cheats and lies then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman and like his other miserable friends pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it whatever human emotions the clash aretha franklin and bruce springsteen records hold rob and co grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him but these aren t any girlfriends these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob rob s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life the plot in three words is women and music the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective it gives high fidelity a quickly paced informal structure adjectives which perfectly parallel rob s own lifestyle it also helps open the viewer s eyes as to how annoying barry is jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob who must work with him every day of the week what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast consisting of big stars and character actors that really defines rob now instead of rob just talking to the camera after he explains something the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn t end when it should have ended instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie high fidelity is a cheerful old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen they make everyone look and feel great 
as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens i have some idea of how ellie aroway jodie foster feels but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers i can t say that i do exactly her reason is that she needs solid proof there is no proof that god existed so therefor she does not believe ellie also believes in aliens and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist how can she say she doesn t believe in god because of the lack of proof and then say she believes in aliens which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite that s the catch when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them okay well they didn t really fax them ellie wants to be the one to go but because of her atheism she is denied the position how dumb is that she discovers the transmitions then she isn t allowed to go well because of a bomb and a psychopath jake busey she does end up going but not in the way that we would ve thought contact is based on a novel by carl sagan who died during the filmmaking it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the rd kind and will end up being the best film of the year its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some but will stimulate more i m glad at least one movie of the s can portray aliens in a psitive light rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body 
you ve heard all the hype you ve seen all their faces natalie portman the professional as queen amidala liam neeson schindler s list as qui gon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotting as obi wan kenobi and jake lloyd jingle all the way as young anakin skywalker if you ve read any reviews you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy you also may have heard that this one s too kiddie friendly and doesn t have enough content for adults believe the hype the effects are stunning the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duels are amazing and queen amidala s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth but there s something missing here and it isn t budget or effects it s everything money can t buy the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters the most successful at this is liam neeson who as qui gon jinn a jedi master to young obi wan kenobi has quiet dignity and a wise commanding presence he is the anchor to this movie as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out portman s queen amidala and mcgregor s obi wan kenobi don t fare nearly so well amidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation comes off as stoic stilted and caricatured it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life and obi wan although mcgregor makes him very endearing has so little screen time that he s nothing but a robin to qui gon jinn s batman however mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity and he does a good job he also absolutely nails alec guiness obi wan in episode scottish accent and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise in fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit and that s one of the problems with this film i would never call myself a star wars fan especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days but i ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america however if you are the one person in america who hasn t seen the films at all or even recently or who doesn t bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters you may be hopelessly lost for example one of the film s main nefarious characters is senator palpatine for those of you not recently steeped in star wars trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader s master in return of the jedi and empire strikes back so obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful a lot of the movie is like that r d and c po make token appearances and it s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience s pre existing fondness for them because he doesn t do much to add to it in any way same goes for jabba the hutt who doesn t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy even planets make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strikes back and alderaan leia s home planet which we never actually see that gets blown up in star wars show up or are mentioned briefly in passing what s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty there s no meat no substance that makes you want to love the characters as they are not as they will be another problem is that there are actually too many alien characters in the film i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters had mouths that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual characters and jar jar binks a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended as comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast unlike chewbacca and c po who got their humanity if you ll pardon the expression from their interactions with the human characters jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles furthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot oddly this isn t just my judgment lucas has said that he designed this film for kids well he s done a good job the hero of this film of course is young anakin but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy that s not jake lloyd s fault though he does a good job of being a cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him that s another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader warning spoilers ahead in my opinion there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin s future evil in the film the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks and there s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie he has a doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn t all hearts and roses is yoda s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui gon jinn his explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead enter at your own risk of course the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul a scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts but has turned to the dark side this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup because qui gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force obi wan qui gon s young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself so at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begins with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker did this story need to be told i would say no but is it a worthwhile movie to see absolutely if you don t enter the theater with jedi size expectations and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler happier time above all this is a fun movie not deep not meaningful and not profound but fun maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct because if lucas does the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most potential 
hedwig and the angry inch john cameron mitchell miriam shor stephen trask michael pitt theodore liscinski michael aronov andrea martin maurice dean wint ben mayer goodman animation by emily hubley adapted from the stage play by john cameron mitchell and stephen trask music and lyrics by stephn trask written and directed by john cameron mitchell minutes rated r stars had hedwig and the angry inch came out in the s right after david bowie s ziggy stardust it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time released in the channel sensory overload world of however the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed off broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention i almost missed it every august the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like summer catch and bubble boy that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run but an e mail from a reader asking why i hadn t reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater thank goodness for readers like him hedwig and the angry inch is a gender bending glam rock spectacular packed with great songs stylistically the hook laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie bat out of hell era meatloaf and the rocky horror show without ever seeming like imitations as with tommy hedwig tells a story of isolation pain and defiance but without the bloated feel of that beloved but overrated rock opera writer director star john cameron mitchell and composer lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner mitchell stars as hedwig a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u s coffee shops with her pan slavic band the angry inch while the patrons of the run down restaurants look on in shock and sometimes horror hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song she was once a boy named hansel ben mayer goodman living with his mother alberta watson and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio life is an exercise in duality for hansel a wall splits his hometown into two parts mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half as hansel grows up the duality becomes more pronounced after initially mistaking him for a girl a gi from the states maurice dean wint falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him alas hansel will never pass the mandatory physical mother helpfully suggests a sex change but the operation goes bad hence the references to the angry inch yes i know this part is squirm inducing but stick with me it s worth it several years later mr right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig decked out in a farrah fawcett style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women hedwig finds a new love in tommy michael pitt a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity but tommy does hedwig wrong stealing her songs and becoming a superstar cut to the present tommy gnosis stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him despite warnings from her manager andrea martin that she could easily be labeled a stalker hegwig and her new band the angry inch continue their coffee shop tour shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of tommy and rocky horror as hedwig john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being mitchell has world class style and vocal chords to match even though the backstory is unusually strong mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and trust me these are full fledged rock songs not the over processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film there is much of interest on the sidelines miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak hedwig s lover and bandmate conveying a great deal through expressions alone decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard she makes a mighty attractive man as always sctv veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy the angelic appearing little rat artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical hedwig and the angry inch surrounds a weird funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast true originals do not come along very often don t let this slip out of town without seeing it 
i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one folks i loved the wedding singer but it gets worse if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence hell same paragraph as the wedding singer i m bound to be lynched well lynch me then because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory with titanic as the only exception right away you re ready to discount my review aren t you you re thinking that i can t possibly know what i m talking about after all this is adam sandler right well there s more i actually got choked up and more than once yes the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes but before you shrug me off as an imbecile i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself the wedding singer is the story of robby hart sandler a rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so but when his own wedding results in a no show for the bride angela featherstone as linda robby begins to re examine his life and wonder why true love doesn t exist for people like him in the process of performing at these receptions robby meets a waitress named julia played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore whose reputation is anything but this character julia too is engaged and when robby finds himself without a wife his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding seeing as how her fiance the miami vice loving glenn matthew glave doesn t seem all that interested as the time goes by we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding he s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women it s obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for this isn t sleepless in seattle but i d actually compare it to that before i d compare it to happy gilmore while the wedding singer maintains some of that post snl cornball humor its sincerity and charm carry it a very very long way sandler is great in his role and yes if you allow it you can take him seriously barrymore seems perfect along side him and although the two more likely represent gen x moronism and party girl ditzism respectively the two go together like bread and butter as a mid eighties couple one scene in particular where julia ponders the future in a mirror is so well done i was on the verge of tears unfortunately sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no brainer but it s got so much surprise substance packed inside that i m encouraging everyone to go see it in fact the entire theater applauded when the film ended and laughs were so consistent some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar the setting was milked for everything it was worth and for those of us that are old enough to remember it it was a bodacious trip back and done very well sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm or is it anti charm while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars it s hilarious and it s touching it s got that great cheezy humor but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected this is one to see again and again is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of my magic ball predicts it is certain 
there seem to be two reactions to dark city you either love it or you are unimpressed count me as a love it as good as the crow and spawn are dark city is better where the former two have a specific comic book following the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal it has a similar look to the others but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent not clever or complex the story is still fascinating like a selection from the twilight zone a man rufus sewell is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe surprised the attacker runs off the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman s body in the room a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately so he packs some clothes and leaves never sure why he s leaving or what he s fleeing ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city hounding him like figures in a nightmare an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i d the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch now if only he could remember the rest of his life dark city is good on many levels first the look of the movie is excellent give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements there are visual elements from the american s s mixed with dickens era urban industrial elements it is all pulled together in a sad dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper s painting nighthawks proyas use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film s world for not only does the audience see the city a model but so do the ghouls the look is like a cross between tim burton s batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay second the editing of the film is good the pacing is on track and the plot is revealed the amnesia explained in satisfying increments also the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense caffeinated look third the special effects are well used they look good but more importantly the right effects are used for the right job one example stands out in my mind the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically a simple ripple effect is used a more showy effect could have been chosen but then it would have just been gratuitous restraint was shown where necessary letting the more critical effects look more impressive finally like gattaca dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance unlike gattaca the story is just open ended and non literal enough to be successful john murdoch s recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night and the hopeful coming of the dawn his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind at least in his world when we finally see the big picture of the movie s world it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle a few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave but i do strongly recommend it for its look its pace its story and its timelessness 
insane but inspired musical about alferd packer the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer trey parker supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold throughout packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse a tribe of ute indians that doesn t seem quite on the mark and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism parker obviously knows his musicals very well because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film he would accomplish this again in his post cannibal musical motion picture south park bigger longer and uncut apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre south park parker and stone in their first effort cannibal also offers up some pretty decent laughs the aforementioned ute indian tribe that packer s group encounters is a definite highlight as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen one of which ends on a comedically deadly note stone s humphrey character steals the show especially when complaining about the prospect of having to eat butt or revealing what s underneath his muff cap jason mchugh s character of mr miller is the stand out performance though as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings as i mentioned before parker s songs are very catchy you ll be hard pressed to get it s a shpadoinkle day out of your head once you ve heard it incidentally the braniff logo that appears at the end of every south park episode is scored with a few notes from this song other songs you ll find yourself humming include when i was on top of you a love ballad the trapper s song the villains leit motif and hang the bastard the rousing finale thankfully none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park bigger longer uncut s songs are released as a pick up through troma studios the film is available on videocassette and dvd the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films as for the dvd well that s a different story probably one of the best dvd packages of the year and potentially of all time cannibal the musical the dvd is a massive achievement presented in full frame only the disc has the usual troma inclusions the tour of troma the troma intelligence test trailers for upcoming releases but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal specific extras the first thing i must note is the transfer is about as beautiful as any i ve ever seen on any disc the picture is crisp clear and free from any noticeable artifacts add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard featuring trey parker matt stone jason mchugh dian bachar and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven t scratched the surface of the extras there s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film a clip with trey matt and lemmy of the band motorhead from the film terror firmer an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film and finally an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal it s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time 
i have a soft spot in my heart for pure amoral sleaze i liked showgirls there i said it i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz sex filled cinematic tabloid ish trash wild things is the best sleazy film i ve ever seen it s filled with great performances graphic sex three way sex rape charges double crosses plot twists genitalia of all genders graphic violence death witty humor and best of all denise richards criticizing this film for being disgusting raucous and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing or titanic for being lofty and epic wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors but i don t just admire it for this i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies i must admit up front however that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal i imagine that this shows it s hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn t be known i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer but i was wrong there are a lot of turns here i ll just say that the film takes place in blue bay a rich little town in florida in blue bay lives sam lombardo matt dillon a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students kelly van ryan denise richards and suzie toller neve campbell kelly s mother sandra theresa russell immediately presses charges all of this happens fairly early in the film and right up until this point i had the whole film predicted i was wrong though and every time i was proven wrong i was shocked wild things isn t even remotely plausible but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless and often invited just for kicks i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers i d give the preview four stars it made me want to see the movie so much that i ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since over the past few weeks though i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview see independence day thankfully i was proven wrong the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company not only does it make us want to see the film but it doesn t give away any of the secrets but i m not here to talk about the preview i m here to talk about denise richards now i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she s in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can of course this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes and flawless body but i thought she did a great job acting too stop laughing no richards is truly a find she is talented and always convincing in this film this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future the other actors are good too dillon is as suave as ever it s nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in out bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them though i won t pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex for a plot like this to work all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived that s okay because director john mcnaughton knows that he s making a self consciously wicked film each scene even the three way sex scene is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton and the result is a sleaze fest that s too smart to resist there isn t an inconsistent moment in wild things every bit of it is alluring garbage so trashy it s funny and so entertaining it s painful i loved it 
lisa cholodenko s high art is an intelligent quiet drama its strongest quality aside from the top notch central performances is the perceptive way in which the film also written by cholodenko observes its characters they are all flawed people some more troubled than others but they are not judged judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers parts because no one no matter how bad off they are deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of syd radha mitchell a year old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james gabriel mann has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high profile photography magazine frame she very much enjoys where her career is headed but is often not taken very seriously by her managers who are always giving her petty jobs to do when she knows she could be doing more important things one night while taking a bath syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers so when she goes up there to inform them of it she meets lucy beliner ally sheedy a thin worn out and unhappy woman who lives with her drug addicted german girlfriend greta patricia clarkson a pathetic former actress who is usually so out of it that she often is in and out of conciousness syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before lucy claims she doesn t want to get back into the profession but syd manages to convince the frame editors to do a piece on her work all the while syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons high art is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger coated or idealized but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere while syd s luck begins to rise the film in no way is about lesbianism but about love which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other even if the relationship might be doomed with this picture ally sheedy s star has risen once again thanks to her touching nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy a woman who in the course of a decade has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs which has taken away her once blossoming career her characted really is tragic and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem and her mother matter of factly responds by saying she can t help her is heartbreaking although not autobiographical sheedy has had drug problems in her past and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy s footsteps to her role also very good is radha mitchell as syd who previously starred in the slight australian comedy love and other catastrophes wh caught me by surprise with her performance easily being able to pass as christina ricci s older sister mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently as accurate as almost every detail is in high art i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james who played by gabriel mann is left with a throwaway role by the time he finds out about syd and lucy he disappears from the film and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other this is a very minor fault however in a film that is full of riches although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems the character of dominique anh duong the frame editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas was also written to be far more mature than expected and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done for once it did not invlove steaminess or violent sexual activity or gratuitous nudity but focused on the actual characters who love each other and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex high art which won the screenwriting award at the sundance film festival marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko as well as sheedy s strongest and best role to date 
 minor plot spoilers in review no major spoilers are in review the previous two alien films have each had their own unique styles to them the ridley scott s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film james cameron s aliens was much more of an action film and i liked each film separately for which it was now alien is out and it is it s own film in the same right that alien and aliens were unlike aliens alien requires that you have seen aliens this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off the survivors of the expedition to lv are returning home after battling and beating the aliens the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item an egg in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch find its quarry which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel this vessel crash lands on fury everyone in the vessel is killed except ripley the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash fury is an ex mining maximum security prison when closed down some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years ripley s arrival sparks a problem with the inmates as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner s sport there is an infestation of lice on the planet being an ex prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own i will not go into detail but you can guess what happens here the alien is loose and no one believes ripley s outstanding story she finds comfort in the arms of the colony s doctor yes after years ripley has sex it is not gratuitous in fact we don t even see them kiss but it is just as well a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film there is a lot more gore in alien in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien than either of the earlier two it also sports a new alien with legs i won t say how but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle which i am sure will be explored in alien sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination the rest of the cast is also quite good notably charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury alien has a very distinct look this is due largely to its director david fincher mr fincher who until now has only directed music videos and commercials has done an incredible job here his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no alien film has before for mr fincher i see a long prosperous career ahead of him the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the alien series been set in this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii james horner s aliens this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring this is a great score the ending to alien is quite good there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up but it played very nicely i will not ruin the ending for you go see the film i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season alien is a worthy successor to aliens and alien and when they make alien perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in 
eight years after its release disney has decided to re release the little mermaid theatrically for days and long nights only coincidentally it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox s animated film anastasia was released you know disney they can t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie so when someone else wants to make a little money they counter with an old masterpiece from their vault and you know what i went to see this cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market they still have hotels on boardwalk and park place believe it or not today november at p m i saw the little mermaid for the first time it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago when i stayed with one of my mom s friends for a couple weeks they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and over that two week period i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times by the time i got back home i promised myself i d never see the movie but promises are made to be broken especially when you re looking at a day limited engagement damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale but it s disney ized which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells the heroine of course is ariel voice of jodi benson a year old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans she s also dealing with feelings she hasn t had before which comes when you get scales in places you didn t use to have them about a handsome prince no disney movie would be complete without one her father king triton of the merpeople strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the savage humans in a condemnation that reads as a not so subtle analogy about old fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating what s a king to do though the girl s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn t deter her ariel saves the prince s life when a hurricane rises up and just has to meet him she makes a deal with ursula the sea witch voice of pat carroll you know she s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history she also has octopus tentacles for feet something those dr scholl s corn pads will not fix and offers to help ariel out she ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple she ll fall asleep forever it s a simplistic plot yes but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons certainly since the s all the elements are there memorable songs like under the sea and kiss the girl cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder an evil villain who still has characterization and charm and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children the little mermaid is worth a big screen ticket in so hurry up you only have five days left serving america for more than th of a century 
disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure mulan while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults fa mulan ming na wen singing lea salonga wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family it s just that she doesn t quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker miriam margoyles mulan would prefer speaking her mind but there is trouble on the horizon the evil huns led by shan yu miguel ferrer are invading china the emperor pat morita has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army the only male in mulan s family is her father fa zhou soon tek oh who old and with a bad leg honorably accepts his fate mulan on the other hand decides to save her father s life by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield mulan under the assumed name of ping appears at camp where she along with the other bumbling recruits yao harvey fierstein chien po jerry tondo and ling gedde watanabe are trained in the art of war by captain shang b d wong singing donny osmond but she s not alone in her tasks in typical disney fashion she has three animal companions her horse khan a lucky cricket crickey and a pint sized guardian dragon called mushu eddie murphy much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn t flow well with the rest of the more serious story sure some occasional comic relief is welcome particularly in a film geared for the younger set but mulan overdoes it the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good but schizophrenic experience but that commentary aside this is a very well made film which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable the animation is on par with some of disney s best the story itself is interesting and the action scenes are awe inspiring the musical score to the film is enjoyable though as has been the case with disney s recent work the songs are mostly forgettable at least we re only subjected to four of them this time around mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date most of the killing is off screen and it s all highly depersonalized there s nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi s mom there s nothing graphic and the film resides snugly inside a g rating children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies it s ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor ax the compulsory songs and remove the obligatory and somewhat unrealistic romance they could have had a classic on their hands instead they merely deliver a very good time at the movies 
plot derek zoolander is a male model he is also very dumb and impressionable for that reason he is secretly hired and trained so secret that even he doesn t know about it by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia who wants to abolish child labor in his country will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed will zoolander ever grace the world his new look is this a funny movie find out below critique there s a place in our world for stupid comedies films which don t pretend to take themselves seriously are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes there s also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history might be an ideal circumstance during which to relax by watching something so completely frivolous well if you re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time of course comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny while others will grant them the stupid but consider it funny instead i personally enjoyed it for the most part cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry snap it was also nice to see several real life models with small roles in the movie not taking themselves too seriously and if you re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films well don t look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn billy zane winona ryder christian slater david duchovny natalie portman and many many others i especially liked andy dick s complete make over as the masseuse hi larious but with all films of this type there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn t work a few particulars which didn t strike my fancy included the bulimia and orgy sequence with christine taylor the break dance fighting and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this why not just make up a country instead of zeroing in on a certain people i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general since she wasn t all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then more zoolander dude but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me i almost pissed myself during the gas station disaster absolutely adored the walk off contest with david bowie as the judge no less and appreciated many of zoolander s moronic one liners i was a merman a merman and i dare you to get his monkey photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie you re a monkey derek a monkey i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film both of which zipped and zagged and established a nice rhythm to it all again it s to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well if you thought the trailer was dumb skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something a film from which there is an obvious influence here blue steel baby yeah where s joblo coming from austin powers austin powers deuce bigalow dude where s my car freddy got fingered jay silent bob strike back joe dirt meet the parents say it isn t so 
synopsis bobby garfield yelchin lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother hope davis bobby s world revolves around his friends especially the spritely carol boorem then one day a new boarder arrives at bobby s house ted brautigan hopkins is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking as the bond between bobby and ted deepens bobby becomes privy to ted s great secret an event which will change both of their lives forever review a small but enchanting movie hearts in atlantis easily recalls another king inspired coming of age film stand by me both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys hearts is a tribute to the magic of childhood to those summers when the days seem neverending and nothing means more than your closest friends unlike stand by me there is a supernatural element to hearts but although it is key to the plot it is not prominent like stand by me this is a mostly character driven film and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting yelchin is very good as bobby finding a good mix of innocence and resignation more splendid still is boorem whom i praised highly for her work in along came a spider and who is simply radiant here as carol and then there is hopkins who despite playing such a quiet introspective character as ted nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen less successful is davis whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish i also found it odd that bobby and carol s other friend sully whose death as an adult sets up the movie s flashback framing device is paid virtually no attention but hicks direction is lovely without being cloying and despite the movie s general lack of incident it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience 
the truman show paramount pictures running time hour minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait jim carrey s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen in case you ve been asleep for the last few months the plot centres on truman burbank carrey who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven his life seems so perfect however because it s controlled by christoff harris creator of the truman show the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of that s right burbank s life is being broadcast live to the american public and seahaven and all it s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far with an idea so different it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator luckily the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie talking of carrey he s perfect in this movie enjoying the best role in his career his character is a re inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask and is completely suited to carrey s persona he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode shrieking and being silly but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey he s not completely dramatic like the film promises however ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff the megalomaniac creator of the show quiet and well spoken he burns an image into the viewer unfortunately he s barely in the film and for the first hour dosen t appear at all also disappointing is natascha mcelhone s character sylvia she plays the role well but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her the supporting cast is excellent and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect so perfect it s creepy the philip glass soundtrack is also superb and is used to great effect during the film peter weir keeps the film going clearly having fun the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card although it is slightly slow to begin with about half an hour into film the pace really picks up and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll sadly though the film is practically over when the film is in full steam also concerning the ending it is slightly too ambiguous which was disappointing the screenwriter andrew niccol who bought us gattaca delivers an entertaining script and manages to keep the plot in trim while christoff s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly they never go over the line which would have been easy for niccol to do also there s some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show overall the truman show is excellent entertainment certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces it should be viewed by everyone it offers something to every member of the audience and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed overall rating review by david wilcock you know for kids norville barnes

note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned among my fanatical ticker tape worshipping friends there s one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky s darkly original pi the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which through analysis will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour an example of the mentality involved if the stock price goes up like this and then down like that and then sharply up this way it then will go this way while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market knowledge check prices up good prices down bad most of the time at least and hence really couldn t comment with any authority it s always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system and besides if it were that simple no doubt somebody would ve already figured it all out the difference in this case is that while my colleague an otherwise assuredly realistic individual truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character s psychosis it s also vastly more convincing with its argument mathematics is the language of the universe insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen sean gullette in a cool mantra like voice over which repeats throughout the picture since nature can be expressed in numbers and there are patterns everywhere in nature he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything the ups and downs of the stock market how many games the yankees will win this year the flavour of jam i m going to put on my toast tomorrow morning obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe max lives in paranoid self imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment single mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines the elusive pursuit of a mysterious digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness the story then is basically an eccentricity but it s a clever astute eccentricity perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one s individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers max s all consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering unsettling mood it helps matters that he s not a particularly likable protagonist all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max a spindly neurotic looking individual who hasn t the time to indulge in pleasantries for a film which puts its lead character front and center mr gullette appears in virtually every scene pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics because of our ambivalence with max we re not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we re following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination it s more disturbing journey than quest still we do care about max s fate teetering on the edge of dementia he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain both fronted by deliciously perky resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions as we know in films where paranoia is a dominant element see the truman show s laura linney character or for that matter in real life it s always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary pi a film that addresses patterns itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle headache scene important revelation or bit of plot development pill popping montage hallucinatory nightmare with decidedly cronenberg esque undertones few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body themed horror nosebleeding reality the repetitiveness far from being tedious is effectively maddening more than anything the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max s claustrophobic perspective in this regard it wildly succeeds due to mr aronofsky s striking direction it s a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist s warped perspective of his surrounding and high contrast black and white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings in some scenes the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter day max schreck from nosferatu using savage jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation the picture is often dizzying to behold and max s effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so called snorri cam which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts pi s raw aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch s early work in particular eraserhead the film s sinister tone splashes onto the screen

the idea at the center of the devil s advocate which is thus far one of the three or four best films of is that no matter what decision is made evil will triumph god is a trickster satan is a humanist the last humanist he appears in many guises and seduces many men and women in his own words vanity by far my favorite sin al pacino plays this role with relish and gets to chew some delectable lines lemme givya a piece o inside wisdom on god i have a million names as john milton the devil the main idea that he can appear as anyone in any form in this case a buisness man harkens mainly back to terry gilliam s the time bandits but the film is something else something original part of what makes it so very good is that it never takes itself too seriously it dabbles with morality vanity death and child abuse but doesn t try to become any profound study of power this is a marvelous confection cocky funny thought provoking it is also entertaining there is no way you could possibly predict the ending it pulls back upon itself drawing purely out of the mind s eye the final shot is more creative more daring more challenging then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen s fargo the central themes are fascinating sometimes reminiscent of james the turn of the screw and oates accursed inhabitants of the house of bly and the product that is built around it really wows its nice to know that things like this are still being made 
sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest some people call it original or artsy or abstract some people simply call it trash a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings definitely a generation x aimed movie a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke based musical dream sequence whew anyone in their s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film it s somewhat silly it s somewhat outrageous and it s definitely not your typical romance story but for the right audience it works a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting well sorry folks but i haven t seen trainspotting so i can t really compare whether that works in this film s favor or not is beyond me but i do know this ewan mcgregor whom i had never had the pleasure of watching definitely charmed me he was great cameron diaz s character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp the audience may find it difficult to care about her thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him misguided you bet loveable you bet a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city utah this was just one more thing i didn t know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise but i think even if i had known i would have been just as happy a life less ordinary is quirky eccentric and downright charming not for everyone but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies 
eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career known for his notorious late s slump murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years with the exception of the dreadful holy man he appears to be on pace for a full fledged comeback life was a great move on the part of murphy and co star martin lawrence because it s a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap sticky drivel director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own and doesn t insert a distracting plot to back them up life is in a sense one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other amazingly the scale never tips in either s favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other as the movie opens we re introduced to ray gibson eddie murphy a two timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks martin lawrence somehow after multiple contrivances the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run when all is said and done ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff hence the setting of life mississippi state prison where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important and become set on finding an fool proof escape plan the film takes us from the s all the way to the s presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude luckily rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic academy award caliber manner not only do we believe the characters look as if they re years old but they sound like it too murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it s sleeve while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it s core but the comedic aspects work wonderfully wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama but in both senses it s an overwhelming delight i could say a few bad things about the movie but i don t want to it s such a nice surprise such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll 
in essence good will hunting is an ordinary story told well taken as a whole there s little that s special about this tale it follows a traditional narrative path leaves the audience with a warm fuzzy feeling and never really challenges or surprises us but it s intelligently written with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant strongly directed and nicely acted so while good will hunting is far from a late year masterpiece it s a worthwhile sample of entertainment like scent of a woman which was released around this time of the season five years ago good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world weary veteran and a cocky young man the formula for the two films is similar both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it but the characters are different al pacino s slade was a larger than life individual robin williams sean mcguire is much more subtle and matt damon s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o donnell s charlie will is a troubled individual as a child he was the frequent victim of abuse an orphan he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis now not yet years old he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box but he s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems while working as a janitor at mit he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building s hall blackboards then one evening his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau stellan skarsgard catches him at work will flees but lambeau tracks him down unfortunately by the time the professor finds him will is in jail for assaulting a police offer the judge agrees to release will under two conditions that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist eventually once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man sean mcguire a teacher at bunker hill community college agrees to take the case after a rocky start the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor and as will advances his self awareness in sessions with sean he also learns about friendship from his buddy chuckie ben affleck and love from a harvard co ed named skylar minnie driver the script by co stars matt damon and ben affleck is not a groundbreaking piece of literature and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation the characters are well developed however and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles at one point will comments that a session with sean is turning into a taster s choice moment later will gives a brilliant breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith note since smith co executive produced good will hunting it s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene director gus van sant drugstore cowboy to die for culls genuine emotion from his actors and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes there s an edginess to some of the sean will therapy sessions and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver who became romantically linked while making this film translates effectively to the movie the will skylar relationship is electric likewise the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie s friendship many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation even if the overall story is somewhat generic matt damon who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker is solid although not spectacular as will minnie driver last seen in grosse pointe blank adds another strong performance to a growing resume and it s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams whose sean is sad and wise funny and somber arguably the best dramatic work in the actor s career alongside what he did in the fisher king williams portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination adequate support is provided by ben affleck chasing amy and stellan skarsgard breaking the waves like most of what comes before it the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren t always bad things in a movie provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail good will hunting does both and as a result earns a rating commensurate with the good in the title 
tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever not surprising considering its tiny us budget to date it has earned in excess of us million that s a shocking times profit rumours have it that a smart internet marketing ploy was so successful in gaining cult like fanatics by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews the film just exploded in the box office raking in millions on its opening weekend shot in mm and video i suspect the film chronicles the forays of students who go in search for the legendary blair witch audiences are put in the first person perspective in the entire mis adventure often wobbly and blurry at times it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the disappeared edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences tbwp is simply smart filmed to look as if it was really a stock shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project one may suspect like yours truly that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film making simply amazing in that respect i must say talk about impact oh yes tbwp does have quite a bit in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing i did especially the last bit but i m not revealing more you have to see it for yourself i can t help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become could it be that finally an indie film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning well i guess the fact stays tbwp is highly original clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film no gore no special effects i just can t get over how terribly smart this film is 
the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made i know that is very sweeping statement so i ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of science fiction stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot a space odyssey is probably a better film but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science most all other films we normally classify as science fiction or sf are really just fantasy action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high tech for van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town something bad happens to them pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight apparently everyone in the town is dead the authorities call a wildfire alert summoning four scientists all but one of them somewhat reluctant to a super secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada two of scientists stone and hall fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks their blood turned to powder in their veins some went insane before they died and two of them a baby and an old wino are miraculously still alive they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab where stone pressures the white house to call up a directive an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth like life and mutates as it grows their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet they barely call off the bombing in time but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out this triggers the lab s last ditch defense mechanism an atomic bomb to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw the performances are universally fine with the actors keeping things low key and restrained just like scientists to me the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don t expect this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body s wrist is slashed spilling its powdered blood 
some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find to their big surprise that the majority of people vote republican go to church every sunday and usually don t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film such rude awakening however can happen in another direction conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in something like that happens to jake van dorn george c scott successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community one day his daughter kristen ilah davis disappears from calvinist youth convention in california van dorn is worried because he doesn t believe that his daughter would run from home however the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast peter boyle is even harder kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast s investigation is going so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself unfortunately he lacks experience and the quest that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld is fruitless things change when he devises cunning plan and while doing it stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky season hubley almost two decades after its release hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars it is a real shame because very few movies in today s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt in late s it was totally different situation films were expected to have mature serious themes for the mature audience for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work taxi driver one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in s on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in s and instead of facing them prefers to live in rural conservative cocoons the new america on the other hand fares no better ideals of the so called sexual revolution same as all other revolutions of the swinging sixties degraded into exploitation and depravity instead of being liberated baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas actually aren t so far away nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist meets sleazy porno producer the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian paternalistic and very dedicated to this job the difference between the two is simply in the line of work many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda on the surface it may look that way audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest in the first scenes he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn t deserve to experience parent s worst nightmare the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen s fate is extremely cruel pain and humiliation brought by oscar winning actor george c scott is of such intensity that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda van dorn is perhaps flawed and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end but the viewers simply know that his cause is just and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body on the other hand schrader who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn s his own parents wouldn t allow him to watch movies until he was knows better and tries to bring another side of coin even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities like nicky who actually tries to improve her life and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end unfortunately schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich d finale the script is slightly flawed and schrader as director doesn t show too much originality his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver apart from the scenes in grand rapids those two films even look alike but the content might be more than interesting for today s viewer especially those inspired by the current s revival until boogie nights no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in s hardcore on the other hand might serve as precious document because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs before the advent of video when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering though but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience that shouldn t be too surprising anyway despite some flaws hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema 
the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i ve seen in years but then again i ve always had this phobia of asian born horror films i remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced long haired floating ghosts donning their white gowns euuugh the ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended unlike the horror films coming from the west i m pretty much used to the gore and visual effects so much so they become rather bland nowadays there s really no scary movie from the west for a long time if you have something in mind please tell me this japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by the stephen king of japan which is also i heard televised over the air in japan the film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it one week prior to viewing a journalist and her husband stupid enough tests the so call urban legend and ends up having a week before she meets her doom she and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves the ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today visual subtlety minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film very well done indeed especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore now that s something budding horror film maker wannabes should consider looking into just an idea of how visually powerful the film is it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese both of which i can t understand at all ok i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching but he revealed very little the twists in the plot leading to an unforgettable climax will definitely leave an impression on the audience will have you at the edge of your seat 
known as the most successful highest grossing romantic comedy in history director garry marshall apparently struck gold with pretty woman which opened quietly during the summer of but thanks to positive word of mouth was able to reach upwards of million in theaters alone the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film s two charismatic stars richard gere and julia roberts since the story itself is none too original or even believable the other winning element that makes pretty woman so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence which is rarely as palpable in today s films as it is here edward lewis richard gere is a suave extremely wealthy business mogul who at the start of the picture breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument and abruptly takes his friend s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel stopping the car along the street he asks a woman obviously a prostitute for directions agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks edward ultimately accepts they strike up a conversation and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor this meeting does not lead to sex however as edward confides that he d rather just have someone to talk to and offers her to spend the night just as well since the hooker named vivian is a beautiful generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned when edward finally offers to pay vivian three thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get togethers since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act edward and vivian will finally truly kiss allegedly planned as a grim downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director pretty woman has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale a la cinderella the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been you honestly don t need a high iq or any iq for that matter to guess how the film will end and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less than gratifying and the screenplay is no award winner and yet amidst all of these qualms and flaws pretty woman is an astoundingly charming motion picture and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers you d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go and there are a few select moments not even whole scenes mind you that are as romantic as anything i ve seen on film in the s additionally the film belongs and its success can be attributed to two people and two people only and they are richard gere and julia roberts playing sex symbols throughout the s with such pictures as american gigolo and an officer and a gentleman gere branches out here to play a more quiet almost shy but still alluring character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet and vice versa julia roberts in her breakthrough role after s well received mistic pizza and s steel magnolia for which she was nominated for an academy award is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers not for her line of work but more for her sheer intelligence it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake but screenwriter j f lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing after pretty woman roberts along with meg ryan became the reigning queen of romantic comedies with her latest being the just released runaway bride which repairs gere and roberts together once again and no wonder roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy but also one who can efficiently do drama and in almost every film she appears in it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co star an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co workers that vivian is actually a prostitute and he then approaches her making sexual advances no only does this make vivian feel cheap especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional eloquent young lady but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading and if she likes this particular path on the more dreamy side the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold especially one in which edward enters into the hotel s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress but also her inner and outer glowing beauty another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward who is asleep and placing it on his lips since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days pretty woman does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene which is a happy ending as you d expect and wouldn t have it any other way that somehow does not work perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film though because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem helped along by a warm memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo as vivian s best friend and roommate and a fabulously catchy soundtrack in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie s overall fulfillment pretty woman is a sparkler of a motion picture and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy

in director brett ratner and his stars jackie chan and chris tucker breathed new life into the buddy action film genre with the cross cultural rush hour to the tune of about million you don t mess with success so the team is back again and better in rush hour the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in rush hour that played well to audiences around the world the formula worked so well in fact that the sequel was inevitable i m never thrilled with the idea of a follow up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations surprisingly rush hour wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it the script by jeff nathanson utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film wastes no time getting to the point right from the start terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong killing two american translators and chief inspector lee jackie chan is handed the job of solving the crime concurrently his friend james carter chris tucker arrives on the island for some much needed r r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights instead lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars the makers of rush hour are working at a distinct advantage over the original we the viewer are familiar with the two lead characters and the already existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around that chemistry was a high point and probably the saving point before and now the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in rush hour first and foremost to me in rh is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan s artistry in fight choreography the year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and here he does not disappoint chan s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand such as a trash bucket his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding on the tail end of a yacht in a hong kong massage parlor and for the finale in a las vegas casino like harold lloyd or buster keaton chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop carter who teams again with lee to put down the bad guys when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case he still looks to have some fun when lee goes into a karaoke bar the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan john lone and his hoods carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and with jackie chan has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills the combo of chan s flying feet and fists with tucker s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the lethal weapon films the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently john lone as ricky tan is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign alan king in a walk through performance lone doesn t chew scenery or make pronouncements to get lee and carter but gives the chief bad guy elegance zhang zi yi crouching tiger hidden dragon continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky s taciturn henchlady hu li who carries on an ongoing battle with carter carter has a problem through most of the film with hitting a woman but this falls aside with their eventual one on one melee at the conclusion roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous and resembles sandra bullock as undercover agent isabella molina she doesn t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch director ratner and the original rush hour production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera cinematographer matthew f leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives rh the fluid camera movement the genre film needs production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino the rest of the techs are of the same high quality i m surprised to even say that rush hour is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out so far this summer i give it a b 
martin scorsese s triumphant adaptation of edith wharton s the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early s but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese s finest newland archer day lewis is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ryder a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may countess ellen olenska pfeiffer cousin of may walks into archer s life archer is immediately captivated and finds himself in love with ellen archer is also bound by the limits of new york society which is an intrusive as any other in the world archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status the film s subject matter may seem alien to scorsese but the theme is definitely not it is a theme of forbidden romance guilty pleasures and the consequences causes because of those actions there is a painstakingly flawed hero and his choice between the life he wants and the life he is destined for in truth it is a film about a society the audience doesn t know about but wants to find out more much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun the performances are absolutely breathtaking day lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well ryder is probably the gem of the group for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot and slowly pushes day lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending the supporting cast is also wonderful with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one s memory scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery his script is also excellent slow in buildup with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed it is difficult to make a period piece gripping scorsese however does it beautifully the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere he is patient but he films everything and anything remotely important the cameras sweep pan track and do more than they ve ever done but they are so subtle one doesn t realize he s watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a nd viewing the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot but the viewer doesn t notice it because we want to see more of this gorgeous world there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding and joanne woodward narration is exquisite not a fast film like goodfellas this shares more in common with kundun than anything else and like kundun this is a slow starting film that truly shines when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year 
bob the happy bastard s quickie review the mummy brendan fraser s stuck in the past again but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone fraser is the lead star of the mummy the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising it s a rough adaptation of the film and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages like boris karloff was engulfed in but who cares the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can t get from oh say godzilla or armageddon fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground basically it s a little sign from the mummy buried underneath a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress his plan wake back up and wake her up also making him invincible of course fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian rachel weisz and her brother john hanna along with a former buddy of his deep rising s kevin j o connor and some americans and guess what yup ihmoetep arnold vosloo awakens and wreaks havoc fire flies from the sky flesh eating beetles crawl about and well ihmoetep s plan begins to unfold ok so it s not really all that new a story but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch and the acting from fraser and weisz isn t half bad either the action is pretty intense favorite scene the sandstorm and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror loving folks as well no it s no phantom menace beater but if you re looking for a solid warm up to the summer movie season you won t find a better film under wraps than the mummy if this doesn t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man then nothing will 
director penelope spheeris decline of western civilization ii the metal years dudes suburbia cast mike myers wayne campbell dana carvey garth algar rob lowe benjamin oliver tia carrere cassandra summary wayne and garth have a public access show called wayne s world the show is a underground hit until benjamin oliver comes onto the scene benjamin wants to turn the show into a big hit nationwide possibly destroying the essence of wayne s world in the process expectations medium long review i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film i didn t believe that they mike myers and dana carvey could hold it up for an hour and a half i figured that perhaps the first half hour would be great and the rest would be fluff however i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film with the exception of the ending which i won t discuss for obvious reasons but it s not that bad story the plot was quite thin but it really wasn t that noticeable because of the rapid fire jokes that myers wrote in alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots in being very parodyish okay bad term extremely witty throughout although as in hot shots it got a bit repetitive in the middle acting as in many comedies the acting isn t really that important however myers turns in a good performance as wayne playing the character perfectly although i still liked him better back on much music in a more canadian type of mode carvey is okay as garth but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra playing it very stilted lowe is fine as ben oliver but is nothing to write home about without a doubt this movie is mike myers all the way direction spheeris is a classic music movie director making dudes and decline of western civilization ii the metal years she also directed the boys next door which is different to say the least she is very capable knows how direct a comedy the correct camera movements it instill laughs etc one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy overall i would suggest to anyone that likes snl s skits to go see this film in the theatres however my personal opinion as in most comedies is that they work just as well on video you definately have to be fan of music and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film without a doubt this is the best comedy so far this year it ll make tons o dough for everyone involved let s just hope they make a thousand sequels sorry i had to get the lame joke in forgive me 
 sometimes the green mile seems sooooo long indeed and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review on a more positive note let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length the mile in question green due to its faded lime colored linoleum leads from the prison cell to old sparky the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana s cold mountain penitentiary in paul edgecomb tom hanks you ve got mail is the head guard of e block otherwise known as death row keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they talk to the convicts instead of yelling at them this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars into his charge comes one john coffey michael clarke duncan armageddon a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls immediately paul senses something different about this prisoner perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he takes back paul s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health based on steven king s serialized novel the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told eduard delacroix michael jeter patch adams is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks percy wetmore doug hutchison a time to kill is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner fry up close and hal moores james cromwell babe pig in the city is the compassionate warden for whom despite all the executions he s witnessed death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor while it is mr hanks everyman performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for minutes it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting all involved do credible work in their respective roles most especially mr duncan who turns in an impressive fully realized characterization if only the story were more credible writer director frank darabont the shawshank redemption has crafted a flawed fantasy allegory of sorts one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power mr darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts presence on e block the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched much has also been made of coffey s christ like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures coffey s powers are shrouded in mystery taking on the feel of a circus trick coupled with a voodoo like i feel your pain transference in contrast there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god the genuine gifts of healing listed in corinthians is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god true spiritual healing with few exceptions requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism but from the revealed word of god 
the submarine genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is think about it these films are completely based in reality yet only a handful of people have ever been on one making them fascinating to the general public they aren t like movies that take place on a plane or a train as anybody can get on one of those and they aren t like movies that happen in outer space either because no one s done any of that stuff yet when a new one comes out you don t hear anyone say ugh another submarine movie like people tend to say ugh another boxing movie look at modern movies that involve submarines das boot the abyss the hunt for red october crimson tide all are well regarded as top notch entertainment gladly joining that bunch is u which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u s naval submarine during world war ii we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior bill paxton mcconaughey s crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence the mission goes horribly wrong however and as a result mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew as well as a captured german become trapped aboard the u in enemy waters the first great thing about u is the film s opening sequence the german crew of u are under attack which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion it s tense exciting and fascinating and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away once the plot gets moving u gives us action sequence after action sequence making the audience wonder ok now how do they get out of this the stakes keep raising much like in executive decision an excellent action thriller and even though the audience knows how the film will end it s a lot of fun getting there i only have two minor complaints about the entire film the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going which they do i feel as though it could have been done much quicker and less conventionally i mean did we really have to see the ship s crew at a wedding because of that you now know exactly what s going to happen to the groom my other gripe would be during the film s finale there s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president s plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one i cannot stress this enough until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect stick with using models yes u is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you that couldn t happen but the overall point of this film is entertainment it succeeds fantastically pg 
to me nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence ever since the big success of the action thriller face off in the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr cage the perpetually awful assassination thriller snake eyes was one of s worst films mm was a disappointing lost cause but who better than scorsese to match cage s wit and intensity which he does in miraculous fashion with bringing out the dead cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day to day after five years of the stress inducing job frank basically just staggers onward relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care namely a young girl named rose who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york frank desperately wants to be fired but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need i ll fire you tomorrow he promises frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance the first is larry john goodman who always has food on the brain the second is marcus ving rhames a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation and finally tom tom sizemore is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank but they never figured into the actual plot each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank s character because bringing out the dead is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary patricia arquette the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack arquette who recently received the wounds of christ in stigmata performs well around real life husband cage it s unfortunate that after such intriguing character trials and tribulations the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled ineffective finale the movie belongs to the one two punch of cage and scorsese who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to bringing out the dead although it certainly lacks the grit and hard edge of something like goodfellas scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture the incredible camera work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with s kundun does bringing out the dead rival scorsese s finest work only occasionally some of the film feels surprisingly limp but there is enough energy in it s interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice those expecting a grisly risqu product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight arrow approach but it s still a solid admirable effort bringing out the dead was written by the acclaimed paul schrader who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as taxi driver and raging bull schrader s script is full of moments wonderful sharply defined moments that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay the exceptional aspects of the film are it s astounding technical credits and the amazing cast goodman and sizemore are both electric well mainly sizemore but it s the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look watch the actor s deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member and you ll understand why he won a golden globe bringing out the dead is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it s certain flaws scorsese and cage for that matter have done better but their intentions are certainly admirable 
it stands as a moment one will not soon forget a giant green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek dreamworks second computer animated feature but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema a page of this tale serves as that ogre s toilet paper from this opening moment one can infer shrek s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard disney esque fairy tale although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship courage and acceptance excelled by outstanding direction stunning actor voice work and most importantly a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline shrek the previously mentioned ogre holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider known only as the donkey his species who talks and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines along the journey to rescue fiona donkey s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self acknowledgment but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant fire breathing dragon guarding fiona either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them secondly upon shrek s and donkey s redeeming of princess fiona the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her to satisfy her desire for a human knight in shining armor throughout this storyline shrek faces his deep perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth but eventually shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it if one sets his her mind to overcoming something in particular endless possibilities exist after the friendships and courage prevail the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development acceptance surprisingly fiona holds a dark secret of her own due to a spell cast upon her years ago she transforms into an ogre by night in this storyline fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself and she must realize what beauty truly means to simply act as one s self upon fiona s learning of shrek s desire to pursue a relationship with her fiona knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work gives in to her inner demons of self ridicule and hatred any child can pull from fiona s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self acceptance on the technical side shrek triumphs directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers shrek eddie murphy donkey and cameron diaz princess fiona myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other normal beings murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona giving the princess ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay written by ted elliott terry rossio joe stillman and roger s h schulman the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike capping it off with a constant tongue in cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers with shrek dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come the smaller children will laugh and cheer the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages 
every once in a while when an exceptional family film comes along i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children it is remarkable how many non disney films disappear in a couple of weeks now i see that in so doing i have unfairly ghettoized these films so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents but to anyone who wants to support smart funny energetic film making see matilda see it in a theater rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video see the best film i have seen in not the best children s film the best film period based on a story by roald dahl it tells of young matilda wormwood mara wilson an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents harry danny devito a crooked used car salesman and zinnia rhea perlman a simple minded bingo addict the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists and when they do it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books when they finally do send her to school it is to crunchem hall a bleak place run by cruel child hating miss agatha trunchbull pam ferris but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher miss honey embeth davidtz who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness matilda also discovers another special talent the ability to move things with her mind which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull s cruelty it was this spring s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton matilda soars on the cock eyed direction of danny devito devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses and he contributes some memorable images in one scene an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer later an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale it is also characteristic of the best children s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don t realize that they are learning them there is a hilarious moment when matilda s television addicted father snatches away the book she is reading in a wicked joke he thinks moby dick is pornographic and forces her to watch an inane game show hosted by jon lovitz in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child that because i m big and you re little i m right and you re wrong more specifically it has as its heroine an intelligent self confident girl who struggles successfully against other people s notions of how she should behave it is no coincidence that matilda was co written by robin swicord who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women finally matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word devito knows enough to make matilda fast paced and appealing to children taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy including a great chase through her dark house the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character but there are also many many delights for adults including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda s classmates recite in sing song fashion there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda s father i can t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling i will see it again and years from now i will watch it with my children and now i will stop because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin and there is a seat in that theater you should be in if you have a child or ever were a child 
whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films the end result is always a mess of a script acting directing and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above the latest movie morass from hollywood the crew appeared equally destined to fail a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship the scary thing is that it s actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month the crew works for several reasons the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie following four past their prime wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their golden paradise by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property the four mobsters bobby bartellemeo richard dreyfuss joey bats pistella burt reynolds mike the brick donatelli dan hedaya and tony mouth donato seymour cassel decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home this simple plan suddenly goes screwy of course and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris jennifer tilly who wants her stepmother killed a paranoid latin drug lord who s convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him and a rat with its tail on fire the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men instead of concentrating on bobby s search for his daughter the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys balancing the production the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya seymour cassel and the great great burt reynolds are brought out by each character s uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend cop partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner emmy award winning director of the wonder years the quick script written by barry fanaro screenwriter of kingpin is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit the crew is a prime example of how simple and dry witted a comedy can get these days the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids phallus symbols in the head or grandmothers giving head in a spa in the steady flow of extreme comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main it s the elder statesmen like dreyfuss reynolds and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice a decent script and good acting 
there s good news and bad news about mulan the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules on the other hand the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney s best animated feature since the lion king after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married that s what we find out when young mulan voice of ming na wen screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her cartoons meanwhile word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns since mulan s a girl that means her decrepit old father must go she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family that s chinese culture for you so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father s uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army it should have been called g i chang mulan calls on her ancestors for help they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up voiced by eddie murphy mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges murphy s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin lots of wisecracks and ad libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they re going to have you ain t never had a friend like mushu speaking of songs mulan doesn t have too many of them which is a plus with a story like this disney songs about war probably wouldn t go over too well heigh ho heigh ho it s off to war i go and the ones they do have aren t memorable the best of the bunch sad to say is be a man the requisite basic training montage song yes even in medieval china they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle sung by donnie osmond a bad sign if ever there was one be a man accompanies footage of mulan s platoon going from screw ups to heroes it makes me wonder has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that s ended badly i only wish real life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage for the curious mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder length talk macho and slap guys on the butt as was male custom a thousand years ago in china the deception fools everyone but the audience who thinks she might be able to pass for a year old boy at best but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army led by a big evil eyed attilla looking monster as a villain the head of the huns is menacing evil and entirely forgettable i saw the movie yesterday and i don t remember the man s name otherwise mulan is a good movie the animation of the characters themselves isn t as rich as it could and should be but there are some amazing battlefield shots eddie murphy pulls off some good one liners as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita the quintessential asian movie star hell george mr sulu takei does a voice in mulan you get the sense disney said to themselves alright let s get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood who can you think of well there s mr myagi good and mr sulu perfect we ve got ourselves a movie now soon disney really will be able to paint with all the colors of the wind 
synopsis it s in a small italian american neighborhood in new york disco music is popular and the sexual revolution is on but the people of new york are not happy in fact they re terrified as in spike lee s do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip and peoples tempers are flaring the cool of night offers no respite the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam no one knows who the son of sam is and no one is safe all around new york people are different aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny john leguizamo tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna mira sorvino vinny s friend ritchie adrien brody hates disco works at a gay strip club and doesn t want any of the neighborhood folks to know ritchie s girl ruby jennifer esposito is trying to escape a reputation as a slut everyone s different but nobody in the film wants to be framed as alien to the community unfortunately the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor opinion director spike lee s summer of sam is not about a psycho killer nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him it s about differences and how given the right conditions even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex in other movies sex is glamorized for example james bond gets a sexual reward for winning or boring made for video suspense movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess not so with summer of sam in a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy sex is there but it isn t gratuitous or titillating in fact some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed sex is in the film because sexual deviance is part of the film s major theme of difference breeding hostility in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for as rare and thought provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking 
david lynch s blue velvet begins and ends with colorful bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town however what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a strange world of drug dealers sadists and murderers the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy disturbing film they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film its characters its direction and its story thankfully the obscurity that blue velvet relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable since its elements are so originally weird you never know what will happen next this is the main goal of a movie to be spontaneous and surprising blue velvet miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy kyle maclachlan from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer isabella rossellinia who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch s story telling so amazing maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends through these multiple stories maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine however for fans of odd difficult indies blue velvet could be just what they are looking for it is very hard to discuss blue velvet without discussing the performance of dennis hopper s sadistic frank most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role a personality laura dern was consistently annoying but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask frank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy just like his villain in speed hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak this harshness is exactly what frank is so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him even if he theatens you to look away blue velvet has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again for this sole reason it is recommended but also see it to admire lynch s obsession to avoid the norm even if this film is a little too weird for you it s hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it 
in roger michell s romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it s name to the film s title one day american movie superstar anna scott julia roberts walks in to purchase a book on turkey quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an on again off again love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat the film opens with a non verbal cue to anna s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress s appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such without words this sequence gives us a background to her character following however is a set up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives i don t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning but there it is if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view as he is in every scene by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily in fact much of notting hill s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricots from his refrigerator or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image william assures her he wouldn t say a word then adds well i ll probably tell myself now and then but i d never believe it great stuff the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible we re constantly exposed to william s thoughts feelings actions and desires but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the times in between this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grant s film hands down he gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast most notable is rhys ifans as spike william s eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh hugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as william s friends and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst it s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type for example there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as william s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air we re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film s scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect it s kind of a mixed bag but still fares better than many of today s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate notting hill s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all time greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it for a couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and that s not so bad now is it 
the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer director producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director he really is he wrote this film he directed this film he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after years has not lost it s popularity or it s ability to scare the wits out of people i think i have seen halloween over times and each time i find something new and brilliant and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen i own three different versions of the film a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition th anniversary t shirt a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow globe in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only and being truly good it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of copies i knew i had to buy one no matter what i did and man to me it s the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film no words can describe the dvd in halloween michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood years ago in now in grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield illinois followed by his past doctor sam loomis the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut why is he stalking her check out halloween ii it explains it all on this unholy night on october laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives which is trying to stay alive the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did what john carpenter did in is made a ground breaking new film with scares wit and style the movie is flawless if not perfect no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one and in my opinion never will halloween will be like psycho and still be extremely popular even almost years later i just hope someday halloween will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the extra scenes on the dvd edition halloween isn t just another slice and dice horror flick it s an intelligent horrifying and best film experience ever made see halloween and be scared then watch it again reviewed by brandon herring october 
after a stylistic detour with mrs parker and the vicious circle which despite its uncomfortable tone was close to being a conventional movie director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow a romantic black comedy about love betrayal and self absorption while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture rudolph s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing if not always pleasant movie it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it until mrs parker i had not been overly impressed by his movies i found equinox his last pre mrs parker effort to be irritating and frustrating i was somewhat surprised therefore to discover that i liked afterglow there are several reasons for this but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident mannered aspects of his approach the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems the story is absorbing and the acting is top notch in short rudolph has created a world that it s worth spending two hours in afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples jeffrey byron jonny lee miller is a cold seemingly heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife marianne lara flynn boyle for her part marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level all she s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she s ovulating after he refuses to make love she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor the other couple lucky nick nolte and phyllis mann julie christie are an older pair but they re no more content than jeffrey and marianne a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart they remain married as a matter of convenience but since phyllis won t allow lucky to touch her they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey the two of them are immediately attracted to one another and it doesn t take long before they re lounging together naked in her pool meanwhile jeffrey who is captivated by older women runs into phyllis in a hotel bar is smitten and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love sex means something different to everyone to jeffrey it s an unpleasant chore a loss of control to marianne it s a means to a maternal end to lucky it s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles and to phyllis it s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness ultimately none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script but in the performances jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish callous suit and tie businessman those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity lara flynn boyle who wasn t impressive in rudolph s equinox is greatly improved making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky and he manages to deliver some of rudolph s most pregnant lines with practiced ease the clear standout however is julie christie who is nothing short of delicious as the world weary phyllis her often wry occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film s humor and there s hardly ever a moment when she doesn t steal the spotlight from her co stars i don t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph detractors but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director s earlier productions enough of his trademark style remains however to reassure his supporters afterglow is basically a four pronged character study the plot is not especially compelling but the character interaction is and that s the real reason to see this motion picture rudolph has painted an able picture of the non romantic side of love the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction 
what surprises me most about the long awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis i can hear batfans everywhere protesting first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker and indeed this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding oscar worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown romero played the joker in the s tv series on one hand nicholson s joker is extremely funny his murderous escapades and manic outbursts which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film but on the other hand his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind the joker s cruelty and demented diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister this guy is off his rocker and he not only knows it he flaunts it but enough about nicholson as the joker i m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman like many i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting keaton delivers he is convincing as the tormented millionaire bruce wayne and beneath his hard black body armor he is mysterious and formidable as the batman even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city visually batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as the dark knight returns and the killing joke burton s film is a feast for the eyes the million budget is definitely on the screen the sets costumes and make up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations nicholson isn t joking when he boasts wait till they get a load of me his grimacing smile green hair and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous keaton s wardrobe is equally appropriate batman s cape mask and body armor make him look threatening frightening and invincible bringing to mind not adam west s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir s outfit in robocop production designer anton furst s sets are a wonder gotham city is dark and foreboding almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york the batcave is cold bare and desolate the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption the movie s gritty bladerunner robocop look is a joy to behold the plot on the other hand is not as rousing the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology but it fails to give us enough of either one as i mentioned earlier the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker but it never fully establishes batman s psychological motives and underpinnings in terms of action batman is not as thrilling as you might expect burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story more than anything batman is a mood film while batman may not completely absorb and excite you it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books thanks to its distinctive look the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world 
though it is a fine piece of filmmaking there s something about elizabeth that left me a bit cold and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films particularly these days i just didn t care about the characters to me the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters be they imagined or historical as the case may be that the audience gives a hoot about and though elizabeth works well on many levels it falls short of excellence because of that very reason elizabeth takes place in england in as queen mary half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying before she dies though she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs as a result amidst much anger within the council elizabeth becomes the queen of england the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life much of the film deals with elizabeth s love for lord robert a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen there is much ado about her lack of a husband and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece as love interests are such a character driven element i didn t much care about the characters perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett and so i didn t have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen s most loyal advisor sir francis and attenborough as a well meaning but old fashioned lead council why then you must be asking do i recommend elizabeth simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin neither of whom i have heard create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches cellars and castles in th century europe each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown out white light from windows the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot indeed elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade ranking with kundun and braveheart watch also for the incredibly godfather esque mass murder scene it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films 
susan granger s review of hearts in atlantis castle rock warner bros timing is everything and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming of age nostalgia of stand by me with the mystical power of the green mile based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks it s set in in harwich connecticut where fatherless year old bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in a boarding house with his resentful self centered mother hope davis he s devoted to his neighborhood friends mika boorem will rothhaar but his pivotal relationship is with a strange new tenant ted brautigan anthony hopkins who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him instead a library card knowing he s longing for a schwinn bike ted offers to pay him a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers the story structure consists of one long flashback framed by the present featuring the adult bobby david morse minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins mysterious character is genteel sensitive and benignly seductive the only explanation is that he s a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate given the inexplicable state of the world right now the production values and performances are solid particularly hopkins arguably the finest most versatile actor of our era and the children with whom he forges a firm bond on the granger movie gauge of to hearts in atlantis is a wistful enigmatic evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis 
melvin van peebles sweet sweetback s baadasssss song was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before in style content and how it was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was a cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees with its subject matter van peebles a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely by himself because no studio would dare fund such a film he was forced to raise all the money himself the movie ended up costing about part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby van peebles cut costs by hiring non union labor and taking on most of the film s responsibilities himself he wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film as well as starred in the central role he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck for instance when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x rating van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed a little marketing scheme he coined the phrases rated x by an all white jury which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film he also printed the phrase on tee shirts which he had no problem selling the storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple it takes place in los angeles and van peebles stars as the title character a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel and makes money by doing what he does best having sex one day he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they re bringing in suspects on a politically charged case involving murder however on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu mu hubert scales who they proceed to beat viciously acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film this plot allows van peebles camera to roam the darker side of l a the ghettos alleys and back street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked van peebles entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored at the beginning of sweet sweetback he offers this epigraph which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented but a hymn from the mouth of reality van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality not of exaggeration of course with today s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner city life as well as films by spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback doesn t seem all that revolutionary it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made at that time sweet sweetback was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it distributors were petrified of a film that in van peebles words gave the black audience a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking ass of course once it caught on it caught on big sweet sweetback is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft and the mack because those were financed by big hollywood studios sweet sweetback is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers however even if when viewed from an african american perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without its controversies when it was first released an article was published in ebony magazine denouncing the film while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film he has no political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs but in personal and selfish motives still others point to the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm nevertheless a movie like sweet sweetback cannot be made without conflicting points of view it is a revolutionary movie not because it s about one man s defiance but because it put front and center black issues that had never been dealt with before until that point american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain and with the exception of sidney poitier all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites the fact that sweet sweetback was a movie by black about blacks was something new in the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors as simply the black community van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before it when the movie first opened he saw it in a theater next to an older woman near the end of the film when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying to herself oh lord let him die don t let them kill him let him die on his own it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african american in a movie who rebelled against white authority that she couldn t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape and of course sweetback does escape and the screen fills with the message watch out a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues beyond the political aspects sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture which van peebles always intended it to be he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced a film that although dated now was technically fantastic at the time he shot in rough documentary like fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him he makes good use of older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment watching sweet sweetback more than twenty five years after its initial release one realizes that it still has bite arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected in this film but there is more to the film than its racial aspect the legacy of sweet sweetback s baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african american perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him 
well i ll be damned the canadians can make a good movie the world is coming to an end we don t know why or how but apparently there is no way to stop it the world has had this information for months as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations yet for a handful of toronto citizens life goes on they aren t going crazy or attacking people in the streets instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end some engaging in activities they ve always wanted to do some gathering with family and friends and others just seeking to be alone these people s lives however all intersect during their final six hours writer director star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth craig callum keith rennie tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies a gas company employee david cronenberg calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business and patrick mckellar just wants to be by himself but isn t having much success even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to tying everyone even closer things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film but ultimately everything comes together nicely although it s not a happy film some moments are understandably gut wrenching the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances particularly from sandra oh whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly midnight in toronto anyway but i do wonder why the sun never sets come midnight the sun is still shining brightly maybe the sun is crashing into the earth who knows also it s comforting to know that in mankind s final moments on the planet people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus that s not a shot at this film mind you i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars last night is available on dvd from universal home video it contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer r 
casting doogie howser star neil patrick harris as mind reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of starship troopers a hugely entertaining mega budgeted sci fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven who s making quite a recovery from his g string epic showgirls sure starship troopers qualifies as cinematic junk food but that s forgivable when the junk food is this tasty everyone needs a high calorie change of pace from fall s onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait and troopers does the job admirably despite its flaws for its first hour starship troopers plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of saved by the bell and g i jane in the distant years ahead high school grad johnny rico casper van dien signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen denise richards he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot so the couple is broken up but there s temptation awaiting both of them johnny s is in the form of an old friend dina meyer also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor patrick muldoon personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final minutes when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america killing johnny s parents and destroying his home our weakening lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens home planet where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good but the enemy is far smarter more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for and after an initial walloping they must re examine their strategy the exposition played like a futuristic soap opera is silly but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous but never boring training sessions starship troopers really kicks into high gear its last half is all gruesomely violent action a fury of severed limbs decapitations disembowelments brain removal explosions and other jolt inducers that are really going to please the and year old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r rated show the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic imaginative high point it s nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren t too derivative of the titular menace from alien these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights especially the arachnids a spider scorpion crab combo that s all sharp talons and even sharper legs they attack in packs of hundreds and it s a funny scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined gooey mess it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot these sequences of insect warfare are numerous bloody and immensely satisfying the occasional dramatic moments one cast member s death the final resolution to johnny s love triangle are botched a testament to how starship troopers fails to create any strong outstanding characters these bland ken and barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm s length but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la star wars where even the slightest aliens had definite personality the acting is decent but never spectacular most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory smallish roles on beverly hills and or melrose place and it occasionally shows van dien for example is limited but perfectly likeable in smaller parts are the afore mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny s best friend and jake busey gary s son as johnny s sidekick the latter excels at playing creeps see the frighteners or contact but seems off kilter as a second banana starship troopers is based on the novel by robert heinlein a sci fi writer who hasn t exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with s howler the puppet masters but the overall familiarity to the alien trilogy and the promise of great gobs of gore could act as a crowd drawer its own possible influence however might well work against it when the franchise continuation alien resurrection opens in a few weeks we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall 
city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most thought provoking moving and completely unsentimental i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality city of angels is a wonderful film enhanced by interesting and well rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years it s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story and avoids most of the cliches we re so used to seeing in films like this city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders film wings of desire i have yet to see wings of desire so i am unfortunately unable to make a comparison of the two i have heard however that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways which makes me glad that this film isn t a rip off of its source material nicolas cage stars as seth an angel who like all of his angel counterparts is present to lead the dying to heaven or somewhere just like it one day he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr maggie rice meg ryan and his attention is called to her the angels can make themselves seen to humans but they can t experience any of the senses most importantly touch he shows himself to maggie and she falls for him unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status seth wants to become human so he can feel her that s when he meets nathaniel messinger dennis franz former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race as a side note i found messinger to be the most fascinating character for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel i know it sounds ridiculous but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well done after much deliberation she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel this of course is when seth decides to take the plunge literally from a building when he wakes up from the fall he is human and happy to feel what it s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead since i love this film so much i ll make a minor note that it certainly isn t perfect although it is original and mesmerizing it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic though the details are what make the story excellent and steel has done a great job with them the ending too could have been more powerful and less predictable these elements are minor though and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels the acting is superb from everyone involved this is perhaps my second favorite performance from cage my favorite being the rock he s quiet and pensive and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly toned words he s perfect for a role like this and at the same time he reassures us he s not bound by playing the psycho though he is good at it as he shows in face off meg ryan is a powerful enticing and appealingly chirpy actress and her work here is some of her best dennis franz however steals all of his scenes as the energetic former angel what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation director brad silberling is a talented man and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters rather than forced sentimentality his direction is steady and he shows this in just about every scene near the beginning maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead there is no music or elaborate camera work we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information this is the way stories should be told and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do cinematographer john seale the english patient provides some of the most stunning images i ve seen on the big screen hundreds of black clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours just as an example the music by gabriel yared also of the english patient is perfect for this film it s quiet and moody music but not sentimental and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of so far all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre it s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously 
now that boogie nights has made disco respectable again well fashionable at least we shouldn t be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman s the last days of disco stillman who made metropolitan and barcelona using some of the same actors uses disco s final hours to highlight what is another conversation heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director the young upwardly mobile professional don t call them yuppies men and women of the last days of disco frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire amy grant and andrea true connection here they talk and talk and talk intellectualizing about such things as dating success and being liked accepted and admired if talk is cheap the last days of disco must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie harvard educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit perception and style including at one point a riotously inventive deconstruction of the lady and the tramp na ve alice chlo sevigny and sophisticated charlotte kate beckinsale are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house charlotte is confident and outspoken perhaps a little too outspoken alice is shy and introverted like a kindergarten teacher the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot looking good and looking for excitement and that ms beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor here they meet or re meet a variety of eligible men many of whom they knew in college des played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman is one of the club s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back des has reached a crisis point in his life he just found out last wednesday in fact that he s gay whether it s true or not it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend jennifer beals in a small but soul baring turn charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth jimmy mackenzie astin is the advertising exec who by the end of the picture winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain visions of barcelona josh matt keeslar is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say just once book this clown and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice s revolving suitors the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book in fact the entire ensemble is appealing in that well spoken stillman way while the eschewing of ferocious pairing is a favored topic of conversation in the film the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love lust and trouble with each other in an emotional merry go round that cleverly develops its characters through the preferred dynamics of social group interaction more mature than stillman s previous two films the last days of disco is as consistently droll as it is stimulating it s a movie you should definitely get on down to 
in enemy at the gates jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov joseph fiennes who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad it s world war ii and the russian german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland law s vassili is the russian s top pawn to victory lots of war stuff happens an older german version of jude s character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings he s equally talented and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other they constantly switch roles as the war fades far into the background the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov the set up is decent and so are the production values boasting a wide range of grimy locales greasy hair and tattered costumes the art direction prospers the actors however suffer the problem matt damon had in saving private ryan either their eyes teeth skin or a combination of other features looked too white and clean with dirt and blood all around the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action that said the players are mostly good in their roles although i don t think ed harris was really trying maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one notedom while the film is technically about snipers there are far too many predictable sniping scenes director jean jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting but after about the sixth time in which we realize that jude is not going to die it s relatively pointless we get that he s talented okay let s move on that s the problem with enemy at the gates it just doesn t know when to stop witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere reestablishing his title as the most beautiful and often talented man on film jude law carries the movie without him this costly production would have gone into the ground the story and acting are of good quality but there s never a sense of authenticity or reality something about this war movie is undeniably modern and it loses its feeling strange enough the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper 
the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized methodical hatred five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days the first documentary from steven spielberg s survivors of the shoah visual history foundation the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry as the introduction explains even as germany started to lose the war the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe in hungary had the last big population of jews within germany s reach and they became the last target of hitler s final solution each of the five tells his or her story their stories are intercut chronologically starting from normal life in pre war hungary they recall the nazi invasion of hungary being sent to work camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps they recall their horrible precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald the deaths of their family and friends their loss of hope each recalls his or her unfathomable eventual liberation and finally the last days shows their cathartic pained modern day return to their old homes and the camps needless to say their stories are horrifying amazing and emotionally draining by themselves the stories would be forceful testaments but by cutting them in parallel their impact is multiplied by five the last days is a talking heads style documentary it s mostly pictures of people telling their stories intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage in this kind of movie it s almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on screen but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific or at least relevant images to go with his subjects narration the liner notes one of the many nice features of this dvd indicate that there is some never before seen historical footage in the last days it s not clear which scene it is it could be one of two that i hadn t seen before both powerful one is rare color footage shot by an american of piles of victims in cattle cars there is something jarring something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white another segment shows walking skeletons survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war moll told a specific part of the story in a new way in greater detail and i m glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful x mozilla status f words for a holocaust documentary but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring when skies are blue and trees are green also the movie was shot on mm film and not video so the richness and detail are impeccable the dvd s features are plentiful and well chosen there is a theatrical trailer for the movie which is a great introduction to the subject matter there are about fifty still photos both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors also the disc has two complete versions of the movie widescreen and full screen both on the same side one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors plus one for the crew you d think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary but they re not bloopers instead they are solid moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film renee firestone one of the five spoke on camera with dr hans m nch a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz firestone was aggressive questioning the doctor about what his children thought the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz he ends his prayer by saying forgive me for surviving it s ambitious to shoot a documentary on mm film it s ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable television and movies it s ambitious to make it years after the events it covers but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well it s only fitting that the dvd with its wealth of interesting and relevant features would also be ambitious and successful 
 the fighting sullivans contains a major plot development in the last ten minutes that every movie guide has seen fit to give away there was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film as i knew exactly what was going to happen and that s the worst thing that can happen before viewing a movie because of this i will tread lightly so i don t ruin it for anyone reading this review and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it the fighting sullivans revolves around a family that consists of a mother father sister and five brothers the brothers are very close despite the occasional disagreement they are inseperable and never stray from one another their friendship and loyalty is the foundation of this picture the first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children and their various adventures when four of them get into a fight with some local boys the youngest sullivan who is inside a church at the time comes running out to assist but not before properly exiting the chapel if i m being awfully vague about details it s because what i have told you is essentially the first hour and a half all i can say is go watch this film because it is a fine portrait of a family that sticks together through the good and the bad and after you see the movie you will understand why this review has been written the way it has 
i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials but there isn t george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effects bound flicks and he has done it again this is the first star wars film i ve seen on the big screen so of course the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story but its amazing visuals basically the film s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets qui gon liam neeson and his young apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor set out with the animated jar jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war when their ship breaks down and they are stranded they find a young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his slave mother qui gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing anakin participates in a heart pounding podrace one of the highlights of the film to get the equipment needed to fix qui gon s ship however most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy meanwhile queen amadala natalie portman is frustrated and at wit s end being na ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made in all the star wars films human emotions that we the audience can identify with are usually nil but the films are for pure enjoyment not for uplifting purposes despite the fun of watching the movie the phantom menace is not without flaws for starters we have the ill conceived moronic character jar jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience what a klutz george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as say yoda r d or c po but alas his efforts were in vain secondly this may be good or bad depending on your point of view the movie s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic book feel of the previous three star wars installments this is due perhaps to the utter complexity to this movie s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions i can t say much about the acting though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway however there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and at times stale natalie portman has a great presence but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic unfeeling enigma there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk despite the inevitable faults there is so much to enjoy about the movie the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes but they are amazing and edge of your seat fun in their own rite the film is a treasure to look at the visual effects are astonishing of the time the awe inspiring mouth opening eye popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius not since s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element the previous star wars movies kubrick s maybe even of fritz lang s classic silent metropolis however all the sets are so original the original star wars movies can t even match the grandeur of this film s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode the costumes are remarkable and have jean paul gaultier written all over them whether its queen amadala s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold embroidery and feathers or the jedis simple brown uniforms the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie as for john williams score i don t think he s done one as complex or powerful since i can t even remember it is as epic as his schindler s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films but williams has added on made the music much more intense and moving what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed there is very little to hate in the film it s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick it is the best fun film and the best big budget film out today most definitely 
when i first heard that romeo juliet had been updated i shuddered i thought that yet another of shakespeare s classics had been destroyed fortunately i was wrong baz luhrman has directed an in your face and visually stunning piece with this film it revolves around the two rival families who in this version each run multi million dollar enterprises these rival companies families are the capulet s and the montague s the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs who despise one another as the storylines goes romeo montague played by leonardo dicaprio and juliet capulet claire danes meet at a fancy dress party and it is love at first site i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film the scene in which romeo s eyes meet juliet s through the fish tank is one of the most memorable of course they cannot publicly reveal their love for their families are arch enemies so they marry in secret this is where things begin to go wrong the story as with all good shakespeare ends in tragedy the cinematography is spectacular to say the least and the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which to lay our scene as the film says there is very little to criticise the performances are convincing and several of the film s younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers the modernisation of the script is ingenious and clever despite the well known storyline this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience especially the younger generation and this is certainly a great credit to the film
