my friend here in film school just made a two minute long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration as sick as this all is watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i ve ever witnessed sure it may be in bad taste but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest then there s caligula this film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio of both sexes elaborate and lengthy orgies a greased up fist forced up a man s rear wine poured down a man who s had his urinary tracts tied off a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs etc etc etc this could very well be a respectable film and if could have been had the following not occurred a the events were graphically shot in clear view b the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to well show historical accuracy c the film was a million dollar production with lavish sets a rather impressive cast and a whopping hour running time produced and funded by none other than bob guccione owner of penthouse magazine caligula comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since plan from outer space because underneath there s a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified but also brilliantly entertaining after all it s not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry no film should be discarded because its content because film is never about what it s about it s about how it s about as the old cliche goes those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with caligula and that s that it s nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time caligula allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing or so i guess even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons the film opens on the wrong note of course with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen using the over used passage what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer fucking around with his own sister in a field i suppose if one has to lose their soul one has to have a soul in the first place the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell a performance that does the opposite that his performance in a clockwork orange did is next in line for the throne but can t wait for the current emporer tiberius peter o toole ditto only for his performance in lawrence of arabia his grandfather to die so he kills him and ascends to the throne then he abuses his position marries a woman helen mirren who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting so he doesn t just have to sleep with his sister a dreadful teresa ann savoy there to be pretty naked and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with abuses his position a little more a little more and a little more and then i believe invades england then is killed off the filler instead of recounting his life is supposed to be as guccione claims the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome complete with orgies vicious deaths and lots of nudity but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be it instead becomes guccione s twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like oh isn t it great that they just loved having sex and that they killed people so disgustingly and wouldn t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it s so blatantly real bad porn that i ve completely convinced myself that it s not i mean why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up and it s not just that it s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film it s that in a film where the entire feel it s going for isn t felt it s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time the sets are lavish but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this but that doesn t matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all making this not only dark and ugly but just plain dark the camera operation is also the worst i ve ever seen in my entire life not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them then have them out of focus the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow there is no writer to speak of what the hell does it mean that it s adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal but nevertheless the dialogue is shit so laughably bad that i can t in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over could say them with a straight face my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius he could go at any moment but with care he could last a year or so the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian they use his gorgeous adagio of spartacus and phrygia ad nauseum used in an attempt to give the film some emotion but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere the orgy scenes and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo are the result of reshoots by guccione himself which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment every five seconds or so the film cuts to random nudity as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated x john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra i m going to kill my agent i m going to kill my agent and so on and so on for over hours making caligula about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying guccione in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage throughout the entire film the presence of guccione is easily felt as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen pretentiously looking down upon us saying look what i can get away with and if you don t like this then you re a prig and worse than that you know nothing about history uh huh there s a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that s artistically good a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last that would probably make for a good film but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting for disgustingness sake acts is total total bullshit and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both judging from this film there s a film that came out in called the cook the thief his wife and her lover a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren which deals with graphic sex heartstopping violence and gore and even a little cannibalism for good measure that film not only never patronized its viewers but also handled them in a way that was shocking yes but also in a bizarre way entertaining and totally involving there were real characters there in a real situation and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it s going to be offensive to many that film achieved everything it wanted to do and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good and it s everything caligula might have been but alas wasn t

running time approximately hr mins reviewed by jack choo rating the movie starts with a rather se en ish opening sequence rather cool and sets the mood for things to come the story propels the audience into a neo reality somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red existenz is actually the name of a new virtual reality game supposedly vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal drug in this neo reality leigh is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game experience in the form of existenz players are required to have bio ports embedded in their spine which plugs to a game pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience during a secretive beta testing cum teaser meeting for this new game an assassination attempt on life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard law is more of a realists than anything else afraid that he ll lose reality if he begin to play these games but requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt as they soon discover they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected existenz has all the cronenberg gore that is expected of him even so this film is no where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly existenz can probably be looked upon as his s version of videodrome even so it is a poor follow up while in most of his famed films his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot in existenz the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over indulgence than anything else jennifer jason leigh and jude law both commendable actors looked aloof and miss directed throughout the entire film the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b grade category it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film the opening sequence though probably formed a considerable portion of the budget which is actually quite good existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times years ago it would have been another classic for cronenberg cronenberg fans however those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you 
a couple of criminals mario van peebles and loretta devine move into a rich family s house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels however someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them writer mario van peebles delivers a clever script with several unexpected plot twists but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work editing and pacing it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark but alas there was still more minutes to go daniel baldwin i can t believe i m about to type this gives the best performance in the film outshining the other talented members of the cast r 
plot lara croft is british rich and kicks a lot of ass she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in years and that lara holds the key to time well needless to say they want to nab it from her oh yeah lara also likes to sport a lot of tight shirts hummana hummana hummana critique angelina jolie was great in this movie there were also about three action scenes that were pretty cool to look at in this film uhhhhhm unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked bad dialogue generic sidekicks and bad guys a lame mystery yoda esque moments with mumbo jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end all in all this movie wasn t the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about especially since every other scene does feature jolie s torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts but it was quite the letdown nonetheless especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool hip woman hero based on a popular video game i don t know i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west who didn t really tie the whole movie together all that well the film lacked energy a consistent pace and well a fun time i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie all that father crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing and i m not even gonna mention his moustache hehehe why have this shite in the movie at all i especially hated the scenes in which some ghost like figure friend or child would ramble on about lara croft s father while all the time i m not giving one ounce of crap as to what they re talking about i guess that s called lack of character development right that s when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen so that we could actually get into it and care about them i didn t care about anyone in this movie and was bored during most of its let s explain why we re doing all this gobbledygook moments and even though i thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass damn did she look sexy blasting those guns or what everybody else around her was so goddamn boring her butler was a throwaway with no personality her side kick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word bugger and he says it a lot trust me and all of the so called bad guys just spewed one dimension they had no spark no energy amongst them and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool see the trailer and you ll know which ones i m talking about the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull crap just buried it even further also for a movie that s supposed to be about all of these exotic locations i wasn t necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots and even less so with its interiors which all looked like they were shot in the same room mind you i won t go as far as to say that it s the worst movie of the year remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr movies also but it s definitely the worst film that i ve seen during this summer movie season of course it s still early and i m sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead trust me you ll miss the boobs but end your night with some rock solid porn and it s all good where s joblo coming from raiders of the lost ark the mummy lost in space the mummy returns the general s daughter romancing the stone wild wild west mission impossible 
drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside the one who s the awkward klutz or the spunky do it yourselfer the one who just doesn t fit in with the others she has perfected these characters in movies such as the wedding singer and most notably ever after now she s back starring in what could be called a modern day cinderella fable never been kissed you know it s a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary trust me on this one no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg and i don t mean steve invented the printing press the premise is simple barrymore s josie geller at the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun times is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today s teens are feeling and doing josie she says she was named after the s cartoon character was a geek in high school so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance this time she thinks she will get it right and be accepted by the in crowd now what kind of adult with a good job and a successful career would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was and is high school and adolescence these are among the many problems that plague never been kissed screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy blubbering woman child at the least provocation and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school s most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability ok so never been kissed is not a sociological expose of today s high school scene however certain rules should apply to film and one of those is consistency of character among the movie s problems is the ill conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and in the process lose focus on her assignment any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say get me rewrite to be fair barrymore is very appealing but she is given very little to work with she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character but the script continually undermines her barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk talk and act like a cool hip high schooler otherwise she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen age stereotypes and situations never been kissed is entertaining and funny in fits and starts it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish the movie s main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys the outsider who befriends new student josie josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls real mature and that is the main deficiency with never been kissed it s illogical unrealistic uneven and undemanding it has some warm and humorous spots but not enough to overcome its many obstacles

synopsis melissa a mentally disturbed woman who likes to smoke seduces doug a minor league baseball player who likes to study anatomy work on motorcycles and make out with his girlfriend in a public library when doug decides to stop seeing her melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him including his girlfriend his mother and his cat comments malicious i suppose is an acceptable moview for what it is a cheap b movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned psycho lover who wants revenge films like fatal attraction hand that rocks the cradle etc etc that have come before it malicious however really doesn t provide very many particularly suspenseful moments the plot starts off energetically enough the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film it starts to drag unfortunately after this melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug as always seems to happen in movies like these but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other better thrillers before she drugs someone she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend s apartment and of course she stalks so we see a number of shots which are supposed to be suspenseful where she s spying on doug and his girlfriend i won t reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey but i warn you that it s both painfully obvious and a real yawner john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not so bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa one of the script s faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre med student the same cannot be said though for molly ringwald at times she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine especially during her silent i m going to stare you down scenes at other times however she just seems somehow goofy and out of place in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful she screeches f k you you b d and throws a phone she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can t help but laugh malicious certainly isn t the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there but it isn t all that good or original either feel free to treat this film maliciously watch something else 
synopsis original jurassic park survivor alan grant neill is tricked by paul and amanda kirby macy and leoni into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur to rescue their stranded son grant s team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought review there is one reason why jurassic park iii is better than its immediate predecessor the lost world jurassic park the latter wasted minutes of my life the former only the first park was a marvellous film full of awe inspiring sights interesting characters and genuine thrills its two successors have been pale imitations amounting to hundred million dollar b grade horror movies at least this third entry realises it whereas the lost world tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot jurassic park iii simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie the computer animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting and even the first time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie nothing in this rehash even comes close add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman payne and taylor and phoned in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character and there is much less gore than in the lost world making this installment more suitable for children 
in china in i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america i guess i was expecting some sort of political question instead i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind in america do wives and their mothers in law get along well he assured me in china that they did but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked even in china people seem to have problems relating to in laws perhaps some of life s most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage a man trying to relate to his new prospective in laws and vice versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact however greg focker played by ben stiller has been dating and in love with pam byrnes teri polo for ten months and is now ready to propose to her he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie s family and to attend her sister s wedding from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes robert deniro and blythe danner through no fault of his own the airline has lost greg s luggage and he has to ask to borrow clothing it is the beginning of a game of one upmanship in which greg is nearly always one down as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes greg is playing a game he does not understand in a league he is new to but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father in law this film had potential in its tale of one upmanship it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar one that has not been done overly frequently in films but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived too many coincidences in the story work against greg the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro s performance deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities but we do not really see much of that digging ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that randy newman has written a playful score in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the s presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody s imagination humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me i would have to rate it on the to scale and a on the to scale 
i have a confession even though i am a movie junkie i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies i ve never seen any of the original godzillas note that godzilla is not a sequel to the u s godzilla released in it s the american release of a godzilla flick called gojira ni sen mireniamu so part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla the latest entry in an almost year old franchise this was a long awaited treat i was expecting a goofy good time complete with bad dubbing science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so boring i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt you do get all of the so bad they re good traits so normally associated with the franchise but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot it s a deal i wasn t willing to accept hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura s script crams in way too many details and in many cases fails to follow up on them the maneuver is not only disconcerting but gives the movie a permanent logy weighty feel godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops was it a whim a bold political statement i don t know its foe an ancient meteor that looks like prudential s logo doesn t just fight the beast from the far east no it s got to have life saving powers a plot to erase the data from japan a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature there s a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit takehiro murata and a slimy government official hiroshi abe over the handling of godzilla and personal issues and then there s the plucky news photographer and blah blah blah it s like watching magnolia all over again except without the good writing keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs what a waste when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you godzilla does the job it s entertaining and goes down easy the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish the dubbing is nice and awful with murata sounding like he s in constant need of a cough drop as for the dialogue one line summarizes the goofiness factor did anyone see that flying rock go by this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i ve heard the word imbecile used in casual conversation though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla has its moments i wouldn t take kids to see it they ll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose

susan granger s review of america s sweethearts columbia sony what a waste of a talented cast billy crystal and co writer peter tolan have concocted a sly provocative premise and as the opening credits roll it s obvious that they re attempting an old fashioned romantic comedy the story involves a veteran publicist billy crystal who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director christopher walken holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room refusing to show it to anyone he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film s once married but now estranged stars gwen and eddie catherine zeta jones john cusack they ll be so distracted that they won t remember they didn t see the movie or it wasn t what they expected and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic david manning quote scandal for help he turns to gwen s personal assistant sister julia roberts but the laughs are few and far between crystal s glib cynical flack isn t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one liners after six months under the care of a depak chopra like guru alan arkin cusack s character s too emotionally fragile lacking the necessary charisma zeta jones s vain narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one dimensional only hank azaria as zeta jones s much macho spanish lover and stanley tucci as a studio exec and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth basically we don t like these ego driven stereotypical characters let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements and joe roth s direction is predictable formulaic and telegraphic on the granger movie gauge of to america s sweethearts is a contrived shallow as a screwball satire it s strictly superficial 
well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you because thats all that there really is i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot for one thing a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity i am not saying that this isn t possible but it does leave one to wonder i know i did another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations there was one scene that should have been short but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking ok enough already get on with it there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning this movie is also very predictable you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated it gets boring at times to tell you the truth even though there is still action going on another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero some of the characters are not proper for their roles the acting is fine but the characters just don t seem to add up if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn t rate this movie too highly but that s just the thing this movie isn t just the plot its the whole package and this package is really well done the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie the special effects are just amazing you can t tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn t be able to say that the creature wasn t there during filming extinct or not another thing is the destruction scenes wow those were masterpieces well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino s make this one of the reasons to see this movie this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me one little side note although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid there were theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made i thought i d put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this 
i have never been so confused after watching a movie meet joe black is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year with a cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season at first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score then you ll wait for something to happen for half an hour but when you finally understand what s going on you ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this the script is simply a silly and unresolved story which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture it feels like an eternity most of the time it is a pompous soap opera filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and meaningful winks the film is based on alberto caesella s play death takes a holiday the story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying yes soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen brad pitt who introduces himself as death it is bill s time but death has other plans it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive our bill is chosen to be death s guide and in exchange he gets time bill introduces death as joe black who immediately becomes the center of everyone s attention bill s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill s side lives in his house and resides at his office that is not all however bill s youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences it wouldn t be fair to say that this film didn t have some interesting moments such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill s family for dinner when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love the experience is somewhat different it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure it s one thing to say wouldn t it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth to create a motion picture out of this is another four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest scent of a woman hopkins looks great in any role and no matter how shallow or hollow it is he will complete it his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time how can you play death in human form to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters they are not creatures but phenomenas saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work speaking in a calm soft voice portraying death as a lonely distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters he looks and acts more like an angel of death rather than a demon or a red eyed executioner claire forlani and others are also fine stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery in other words this is not what i expected from the director of scent of a woman it could and should be better with such cast and crew in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera 
it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part on the day that one of it s stars roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood having a career that spanned over years and appearing in more than films fright night part probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us at least in the movies anyway it has been several years since charlie brewster ragsdale and b movie actor turned late night horror film host peter vincent mcdowall came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie s next door neighbor charlie and peter won that battle but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family apparently charlie s former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie s stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood fright night part tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort while they are stylish the vamps in this film just don t have the personality of the undead in the first film with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes one bright spot speaking from a strictly sexist point of view is traci lin who plays charlie s very skeptical girlfriend it s really a shame that her career hasn t been better since she made this film ragsdale does a fair job in this film but doesn t give nearly the performance that he did in the original roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given which unfortunately isn t much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner part had more of the feel of a music video never a good thing for a horror film another minus for part was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare for that matter they were almost nonexistent if i was going to watch a horror film this would be far from my first choice the first fright night on the other hand would be right up near the top of my list if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i d probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes either way fright night part would most likely not enter into the equation 
vikings v bears no this isn t the lineup for monday night football rather these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in the th warrior a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory based on michael crichton s book eaters of the dead this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword luckily for the vikings however their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film antonio bandaras is ahmed a travelling ambassador accompanied by his friend omar shariff in a cameo they eventually come across a small viking village we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude they laugh heartily revel in their arrogance and sing songs of battles won but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land help is needed quickly an elderly fortune telling witch arrives after a brief incantation she proclaims that warriors and one more not of norse blood are needed to ensure victory personally i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity nonetheless men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal th the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives of course during their ride ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other burly viking warriors but he ably shows that it s not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings but will his skills and that of the group be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside it does not look promising these creatures resembling bears are strong and have high morale they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods they are ready to sacrifice their lives this is a good way to die says one of the fallen warriors despite the larger than life battle sequences i was unmoved by the entire experience at many points i was even confused for example somewhere in the middle of the film a sub plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis however the sub plot never fully materializes and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion there are other questions that i had but the real problem was that the story little of it that there was offered no characters to love or hate the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma however banderas s role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the th warrior makes him so special an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order also much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night which made battles very difficult to follow i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy as it stands the film manages more confusion than intensity it would make thor cry 
sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking take this film naked killer among it s ingredients are heavy doses of violence rape sequences straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls coarse language but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended one word penis that s it in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is penis it really restores you re faith in the system huh anyway that s just a side point when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip cool controversial thriller what they forgot to mention was that it isn t very good the plot involves male cop tinam simon yam investigating a series of brutal murders while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty chingmy yau who after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father falls in with professional killer sister cindy svenwara madoka realising kitty has potential cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity however in the course of his investigation tinam who believed kitty had disappeared runs into her again but isn t quite sure if it s her to complicate matters the actual serial killlers princess and baby who a former students of cindy and have been told to kill their old master and her new student from then the action ensues all in all this is not a well done movie the script is awful the direction all over the place the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain the shoot out in the car park is almost woo like in adrenaline the fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different let me put this way if you like action get something else if you like strong women in movies get something else if you have do decide between this and black cat for your hong kong female action don t get either even for curiosity value it just isn t worth it let s face it if ever the was a movie that became popular on it s subject alone this is it 
synopsis the president of a company wants to test his self appointed successor who s psychotic and thinks it s a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall comments tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape s sticker in black marker not typically a good sign when you rent a film strike two came while the previews played did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie s quality or lack thereof while watching the trailers that come before it well the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows and they all looked bad definately not a good sign tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery to be fair the first half hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller wolf larson who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film s title james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten brolin s character for some inexplicable reason thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin practically isolated with lebrock and larson whom he s decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company by the time the characters arrive at the cabin this film begins to become tedious apparently brolin s successor s test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing which don t seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city but then again what do i know about business i do think though that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch larson s character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters which really isn t enough to sustain it the film s writer must have taken a cue from stephen king as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald s game larson and lebrock fight and torture each other the tables get turned a couple of times while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help some old guy s around too just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film the old guy however miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it s worthy of a chuckle or two outside of that chuckle unfortunately tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors for some reason become increasing obnoxious if you re in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey don t make tracks to a far superior suspense film like misery 
when i was nine i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures they combined science fiction and fantasy had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read of course the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon not to mention its moderately successful spin off she ra princess of power it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together come with the result of trillions and make a live action masters movie let s be blunt masters of the universe is a very bad movie the story is painfully dull and mind numbingly cliched hands up who wouldn t guess he man and skeletor take their fight into the real world and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors dolph lundgren as he man for one or good actors james tolkan meg foster given such awful characters and dialogue that they can t help but seem terrible it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars we have the alien bounty hunters the desert skif technology stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that deja vu is too polite a term to use in describing it blatant uninspired ripoff would appear more appropriate tv fans might want to check out courtney cox monica in friends and robert duncan mcneill lt paris in star trek voyager very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either so in the face of such mindless sub mediocrity is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all yes there is one incredible good reason his name is frank langella langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood appearing in countless films over the years here he plays skeletor the villain of the piece dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face he is one part darth vader one part emperor and two parts grim reaper given this character langella falls right into it with style and precision skeletor is believable interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right masters of the universe i remember loving it when i was eleven at twenty one it s difficult to see why but as i said it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder besides this year marks the film s th anniversary watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate 
by starring in amy heckerling s clueless two summers ago alicia silverstone proved she wasn t just another pretty pouty ingenue showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of the crush out of the water her only work since that gem has been in june s batman robin where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl now she s the star and producer of excess baggage a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level silverstone s emily t hope is stuck with a billionaire father jack thompson who neglects her emotionally in an outlandish plan to gain his affection she fakes her own kidnapping emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw but before the police can rescue her professional auto thief vincent roche benicio del toro jimmies the locks hot wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily who s still trapped in the back when vincent discovers emily the two don t exactly hit it off she annoys him he annoys her and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner harry connick jr he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there along the way of course they get into a whole heap of trouble and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky felony studded situation it doesn t help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops crooks and even her shady uncle ray christopher walken who s wise to his niece s ploys for attention and has mafia connections for at least a half hour excess baggage bounces along fast and efficiently during this time emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role reversal twist she s an awfully aggressive combative victim and he s quite the aloof seemingly vulnerable captor but once it s past its set up the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once a road movie a teen comedy a mob thriller a drama about family relationships you name the cliche and excess baggage likely covers its territory of course a romance develops between the two leads but it all seems forced and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome do you like my tummy emily coos to vincent at one point in the film huh did i miss something the hard edged foul mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo goo eyes then again excess baggage becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles but the movie isn t game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded motivations keep shifting resulting in an often confusing narrative scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions excess baggage has too many characters too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand i loved silverstone s turn in clueless as an aloof pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen s emma looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there it s simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for excess baggage sadly however excess baggage is no clueless but on the other hand it is clueless 
david spade has a snide sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me it also served as a good showcase for him when he co starred opposite the late chris farley in tommy boy and black sheep lost and found marks the comedian s first attempt at going solo in a movie and it also reveals that when spade doesn t have a reliable back up system his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect david spade is not the problem with lost and found he plays dylan ramsey the sweet main character to the best of his abilities the story revolves around dylan s obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour lila dubois sophie marceau from braveheart and her terrier named jack dylan believes that the best way to a woman s heart is through her dog and so he kidnaps jack planning to stage a fake rescue in hope to win lila over there are three good things about lost and found the first is spade the second is sophie marceau a lovely actress who s been planted into the wrong movie lastly there s the dog who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there s something about mary unfortunately director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute this kind of physical humor is dead pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs and this procedure is cheap unfunny and resoundingly cruel this is where i start to get fuzzy also in this unusual blend is apparently a sweet natured love story between dylan and lila given the mean spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for i found this hard to swallow and why does dylan even deserve someone like lila after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain predictably lost and found opts for a happy ending one that feels so sentimental gooey and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated david spade who also co wrote the movie tries hard so very hard to make this project amusing there are some choice scenes that are quite funny but the movie is only sporadically funny patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over with his good looks and money jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles despite a few positive attributes lost and found just doesn t work if you re searching for an enjoyable romantic comedy you could do far better than this obvious misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it s trying to present 
battlefield long boring and just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman in my mid teen years i had a horrendous re occurring nightmare behind the wheel of a car i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway no matter what i did the view didn t change travelling but not getting anywhere each time i awoke in a sweat terrified you don t have to be carl jung to understand that dream powerless to make changes trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake this is exactly how you will feel minutes after battlefield earth begins for all of its flash and style l ron hubbard s science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of dull and stupid in the year the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for years humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians there s no hope the future is bleak then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler barry pepper who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl john travolta and the alien race it s an archetypal post apocalyptic plot full of promise considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen it s difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably but it does the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold the psychlo never discovered fort knox or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time and gassed up or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don t notice that their slaves are missing for days travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he s worth and is almost entertaining almost the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person man animal or not would ever utter some of the film looks good but it also looks so familiar a race of large hulking ape like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin sound like something charlton heston might be in the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from dune the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with it s too loud it s too oppressive it s too slow it s too long far too long and on it goes the list of the problems with battlefield earth is endless it s difficult to find anything in the film that does work oh yeah the color scheme is nice the real question is how this movie ever got made could it have something to do with the fact that l ron hubbard was the founder of scientology and that john travolta is a member of the church that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago but it doesn t give us a clue as to why first time screenwriter corey mandell s atrocious script was used or why the high profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner s the postman which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure be the big budget science fiction failure battlefield earth has the honor sewed up often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video that s not the case here you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one don t hesitate strike now while the iron is cold 
when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie however since this film also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt however the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio played by lynch however the raid was only partially successful and montana is getting the rap so he begins his own private war against gio trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt in the process he meets gio s mistress gina zamora played by rosie vela and starts relationship with her too although it doesn t stink like many of the similar films can inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine nobody in this film actually puts much effort including madsen or lynch and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela who apart from showing her more than impressive looks shows some of the singing talent too however this isn t reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would in most likelihood forget the next day 
what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie a better question what would inspire a studio to produce said movie if you have an answer let me know foolish the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw droppingly horrible film one with no redeeming value socially cinematically or otherwise comedically it has some potential but only in its stand up comedy moments which i can turn on comedy central for master p stars as fifty dollah beat that as a mobster i think who is trying to start a comedy club act with his little brother foolish eddie griffin but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss played by andrew dice clay for the very first time entertaining a stubborn club owner and family problems the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert s idiot plot if everyone here wasn t an idiot there would be no problem so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names not a hell of a lot as i have mentioned master p cannot act or write he acts like the rapper that he is the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro as for his script well i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience if you haven t yet figured it out that is not saying much co star eddie griffin really the star of the show is quite a different story the fact of the matter is that griffin whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network is an extremely talented comedian stand up and otherwise he has much in common with chris tucker rush hour money talks in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity to the extent which that can be done and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie and indeed i laughed at a few stand up scenes here but from a feature length movie i expect more foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers foolish blurts out towards his jewelry sporting sibling you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car to which i said a bit too loudly for the occasion huh after getting slightly upset with his wife believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard earned you ll get more laughs from watching minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don t have cable eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative although offensive yarn but everyone else should stay the hell away 
this was the last carry on movie if you discount carry on columbus as a carry on movie and was made by a new production company based in central london this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert suzanne danielle to bed her husband emile the french ambassador kenneth williams when he seems unwilling she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes such as the prime minister and the u s ambassador her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead meanwhile theodore valentine larry dann is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her however she is only interested in restoring her husband s ardour which seems a little difficult after emile s accident with a church spire this film is the second worst carry on movie the worst being carry on england it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid as mrs valentine are mildly funny but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted given the script the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler joan sims as mrs dangle kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur and peter butterworth as richmond are worthless and embarassing in fact all four parts are surplus to requirements however the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades an awful script a terrible collection of jokes very poor production values especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st james palace a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score and a non existent plot or storyline its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile a complete waste of time this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies it was a certificate film but by there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april avoid at all costs 
the premise of the new james wong film final destination is that alex browning the protagonist prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane thereby cheating fate however fate is not so easily bested and alex s friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances essentially this premise is a clever way to make a slasher flick without the slasher unfortunately this is practically the only clever thing about the film as far as teen horror flicks go final destination is better than many there is enough shocking death graphic gore and requisite black humor to provide the essential roller coaster type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick unfortunately this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set up the next death the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date this film might do the trick other than that wait until it goes into heavy rotation on cable 
 the red violin is a cold sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached it s a movie that seems almost clinical as it traces the plus years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title opening in the th century the story shows how violin maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son but when tragedy strikes the violin becomes the personification of its maker s grief from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery again tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao s communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz samuel l jackson who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity the violin becomes morritz s obsession just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it morritz however is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator s intention the red violin could have been a touching inspirational story as soaring as a beethoven symphony however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact girard for some unknown reason uses mostly master shots keeping his camera and thus us at a distance we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin it s resonance its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression nor are any of the performances memorable it s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin the red violin promises much but delivers little it is dull at times a bit pretentious and a might murky the movie s music soars over its story and performers and that is its only saving grace 
there s nothing quite like a gory anime really and this is the truth no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it with anime a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword this is a standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ve seen vampire hunter d is a gory gory film if they ever made a live version of the film it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx it s not that it s gore is unique it s just like other gory animes but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it s story characters animation etc it really didn t it was disgusting and gruesome which overshadowed the story what little of it there was it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world because god knows that our local police force just can t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies one evening a blond peasant girl drawn to look and innocent a foreshadow that we will see her naked i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire insert strom thurmand joke here of course he never put a no trespassing sign on his yard so one can t really blame her but he s upset anyway and demands retribution she gets the obligatory bite on the neck aren t there other places to get blood from it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough if it s good enough for doctors to draw blood from then why do vampires stray from that sight to fight the spell she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall dark and handsome vampire hunter you guessed it his name is d the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires being attracted to the year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much you see like all heroes in these kinds of stories he s a brooder who s sole purpose in life is to remain really really silent when he speaks it s in cliches heroes like this are bad when they re live even worse when animated later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire who wants to marry the peasant girl because he s bored after years of living the only clever vampire insight made in the movie will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable in it s defense the animation when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing could at times be original the talking hand was clever and i think the inspiration for a skateboard related logo and that s the best defense i can think of i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans but i really don t see it it s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks and most importantly like all violent anime it is an excuse to see animated breasts why what is the point of that maybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny i m not a prude i just don t think it s warranted it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost is there a neccesity in seeing a year old in the shower of course not it s done for shock it s tasteless and despicable 
it s a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater and unfortunately with man s best friend we ll be waiting a while longer the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio genetics gone wrong sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a good story provokes her to snoop inside of emax a poorly guarded million dollar bio lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding the result she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake camouflage like a chameleon climb trees like a leopard and attack with the strength of tiger max takes a liking to sheedy and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax owned by henrikson well it doesn t take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman etc sheedy is a boring non presence on the screen tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer director i apologize for a lack of credits i suppose i was eager to leave the theater and in my rush forgot to take note of the director writer producer etc henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film the movie depends upon it s ability to impress the audience with animal special effects but all it presents is a dog that can growl open door handles with his paw sit roll over play dead and sick the rest of the special effects were so poor i found them offensive the film attains sub mediocrity an unambitious film at best horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite 
movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good the bad and the despicable i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in but i wanted to re write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics we need to be warned about some truly awful films too this picture was so bad it inspired the description for my rating see ratings chart below the only thing saving it from a rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno so it does indeed have some plusses in fairness elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff and her ability to whine and irritate us even while nude was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone this character is not smart not interesting and deliberately far too annoying far too often like in s bulworth when the movie was over i didn t care one little iota about the main character at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film though showgirls is too stupid to make a statement some people claim that the story is based on the legendary all about eve of all things if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l mankiewicz was he d be well he d be a good screenwriter instead this project may have sunk his career he wrote the ha ha script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed the same team who created a good sex film in basic instinct struck out here with their occasional violence gratuitous x rated sex scenes and numerous and quite unnecessary lesbian overtones the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer after the supposed street smart young lady gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack jawed yokel in the opening sequence she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the stardust hotel nomi doesn t take advantage of this contact to break into the big time of dirty dancing right away first she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club she sells her hot little wares at the cheetah for a short time turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience hey i never said she wasn t a hot number maybe it s that her body which gets her into the big time when the star of the stardust hotel crystal connors gina gershon stops into the strip club it certainly isn t her brains or pleasant disposition crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend kyle maclachlan he also happens to be the pleasure seeking worm who runs the big show crystal gets nomi onto the stardust team and after an interminable amount of time nomi earns the role of crystal s understudy the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she s not a whore that s a phrase we hear a few different times and it s completely ludicrous of course she is she sells her soul to make it big but in the end we re supposed to believe that she s a better person than that we re supposed to root for her no way she s a tramp and a back stabber who deserved nothing least of all vindication in the ahem climax she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is the sub plot with a male dancer glenn plummer who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more it sure ain t character development plummer also appeared in speed in in a smaller yet better role this sub plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay day or his standards have dipped since appearing in blue velvet that picture was weird but some critics claim it s one of the best movies of the s now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the s too his sleazy character is important to showgirls but we don t learn anything about him he uses people to get what he wants but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie is he a villain who cares ultimately this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit everyone must know by now about the soft core acts of copulation especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool what few reviewers take issue with is how mean spirited this movie is everyone s either having sex exacting revenge or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge it s just too hard to take especially for over two hours if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world why couldn t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers grunts and other sounds during the dance numbers it s hard to care about these people if we can t even appreciate what they re capable of doing on stage berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body after all the world of porn is still an active dishonourable profession perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford oops they re bad actors too well at least they re not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone useless trivia ironically elizabeth berkley played virtuous and holier than thou jessie on the teeny bopper tv show saved by the bell before breaking onto the big screen 
and now the high flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics and it isn t pretty this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer a version of dumas s the three musketeers by bringing in popular asian actor stunt coordinator xing xing xiong whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting the end result is a tepid and dull action adventure rip off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay d artagnan justin chambers is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents in paris he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu stephen rea who is trying to overthrow the king and richelieu s man in black associate febre tim roth the killer of his folks he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk so he rounds up aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steven spiers to free the musketeer s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king s prison d artagnan and his new frisky love interest chambermaid francesca mena suvari play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen catherine deneuve ends up being captured by the menancing febre forcing the musketeers to regroup with d artagnan leading the charge and save the day director peter hyams end of days obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles but here it s a disaster one problem is that in reality most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones jet li s high risk is a rip off of die hard not the other way around ironically there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with to minute action sequences because they know the scenes have to carry the picture the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano sudden death horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers the wedding planner to deliver his mousy self as a leader chambers d artangnan isn t a musketeer he s a mouseketeer and hyam s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of th century paris are well noted but that s the only standout in an overall flat production 
various films seen at the seattle film festival it s all true three men on a raft u s a director orson welles a recently uncovered one fourth of orson welle s planned docu drama of amazing stories around the world named it s all true this short dealt with welle s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft while several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle s attempts to film it despite studio problems a staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians sadie thompson u s a director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on w somerset maugham s story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly restored version of frank capra s lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills i was interested to see sadie thompson where the last minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen little awkwardness and a very clever script the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie s soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film or the original script the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on i cannot believe maugham s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and a half for still it s entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymore s incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds a c movie worth if you can find it the pied piper czechoslovakia director jim barta screenwriter kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate and with a lot of political comment along with it perhaps economic content is a better word it certainly doesn t show capitalism in a good light nor human nature nor anything else for that matter as you may have guessed this is not a tgif film this is the kind of film you are glad is over not that it wasn t interesting for technical reasons this is stop animation that is very well done all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts except for the animated stuffed rats boy sounds like a real comedy vehicle doesn t it add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night some gore don t bring children to this one don t bring adults to this one unless they re fascinated by puppetry and or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped blech no fun whatsoever meier west germany director screenwriter peter timm cast rainier grenkowitz nadja engelbrecht alexander hauff thomas besvater sub titled this film takes us back and forth over the east german west german border with meier an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money his uncle also in the west sneaks meier out of the country unknown to the east germans meier however is less than thrilled his girlfriend his friends and his job which he likes all exist in east germany after a round the world trip his boss think s he s on leave in bulgaria meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew s work while everyone think s he s still living in east germany of course something goes wrong and the ending is very funny but it takes the film too long to get there the humor is spread too thin and much of the plot is too obvious as is the acting still a good concept for the comedy and the last five minutes are pretty funny c the right hand man australia director di drew screenplay helen hodgman cast rupert everett hugo weaving arthur dignam jennifer claire catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie going and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival i ve learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to be wary of french comedies these people like jerry lewis ken russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as old pouty lips is probably not worth watching when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography watch out australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since weir and miller left for foreign shores finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult not impossible witness malcolm last year task well i ignored rules last night and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards it s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the s about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses lots and lots of horses the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir unfortunately said son a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident highlights include the amputation sequence the doctor s daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for a diagnosis their tender kissing with a window between them while it s raining you d think a woman studying medicine would know better the photography is good but i kept wishing for b w everything seems sepia colored anyway actually i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead but that s life grade z avoid like the plague unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks 
 practical magic is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap trap like this one the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches spanning back years at the start their parents die when they are still children and they go to live with their two zany aunts stockard channing and dianne wiest switch to the present day gillian who is the stronger more rebellious sibling leaves home and meets up with a dark abusive guy goran visjnic while sally stays in their hometown meets and falls in love with a sweet caring man has two children and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed come to think of it she s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic they accidentally murder him and in desperation bury the body in the backyard of their aunts house add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism not to mention a spattering of light hearted whimsy and you have a pretty good idea how messy practical magic is after seeing the film i reflected that there was not even one scene or element that i liked or enjoyed it is a comedy to be sure but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching it is not charming or entertaining in any way and then to top it off we ve got this dark but bird brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian s body whatever the characters are handled terribly and actually most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film and in every scene involving them they are always standing side by side no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people the same goes for aidan quinn as a handsome police investigator who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock even though he comes into it at around the minute mark and once again there is no attempt to develop their relationship or his character in any way in fact every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along rather than getting to know the people saying the lines i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman who managed to destroy the batman series with batman forever and batman and robin practical magic is directed by griffin dunne primarily an actor who last year made the contrived clumsy romance addicted to love with meg ryan and matthew broderick i disliked that movie quite a bit but since practical magic is even worse that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is i d tell him to quit while he s ahead but in these last two years he s ultimately already buried himself 
the word to describe sharon stone is wonder not that she is a wonder but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent she has a dynamic screen presence in basic instinct turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in casino but possesses neither of those here stone teams up with private school headmaster s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani s thoroughly unlikable husband chazz palminteri in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock as in homage to read steal from it turns out that someone saw them or he s not dead or maybe kathy bates turns in a credible if unspectacular performance as an investigative police detective her character is a bit dull but realistic although her actions at the end are puzzling adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation it s stone that is a disappointment among the actors how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one costumed in skin tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring not enticingly dangerous even the threat or promise of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out on the positive side there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive that is if you can put up with stone s cardboard cut out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch s movies 
after the recent animated debacles of a rugrats movie and a bug s life i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks other insect film from october antz i hated that movie and yet it is so much better than these latest two excursions a bug s life is the second animated insect film in the last two months and i hoped for the best considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar s last film s toy story but in no way does a bug s life even remotely match up to that flik david foley an ant who along with his many comrades has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey flik however feels all alone and unwanted in the world especially after he accidentally loses all of their food and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season s load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees banished from ant island flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out but through a misunderstanding returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs including a walking stick david hyde pierce a dung beetle brad garrett a gypsy moth madeline kahn a male ladybug denis leary and a caterpillar joe ranft a bug s life has one thing going for it only one thing with its glorious bright colors the computer generated animation is a spectacle to look at the film itself unfortunately is a lifeless unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of toy story the characters in a bug s life are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one liners the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable minutes and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time filler after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them but then i realized this is just not so i still adore almost all of the older disney films and many of the newer ones such as s the little mermaid s beauty and the beast s the nightmare before christmas and yes s toy story maybe this has just been a bad year for children s films and hopefully the upcoming the prince of egypt will not be a disappointment as for a bug s life i did not enjoy anything about it not the story not the characters and not even the voiceover work which was far more lively in antz a bug s life goes down as yet another failure for disney and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture i ll be home for christmas 
a film that means well but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama it s jeroen krabb s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in who can t forget their bitter past the heroine is an attractive carefree nonreligious year old chaja fraser who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations screwing a student rebel leader and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother s gebrecht and her self absorbed eccentric father schell her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps and her home life is filled with angst her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos a family album silverware and his old violin he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis but can t locate them now due to all the changes in the city out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents apartment building mr apfelschnitt topol tells her about the hasidics are ultra orthodox they don t go to the cinema or watch tv adhere to strict dress codes and strictly observe their religious laws chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules but soon finds the wife mrs kalman rossellini to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her children a year old named simcha monty who doesn t talk the stern mr kalman krabb is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses to hammer home the point of how anti semitism hasn t gone away there s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge bradley who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator the film is done in by its ham fisted script as the story adapted from carl friedman s book the shovel and the loom goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality it starts off telling chaja s story of how she s a lost jewess trying to find her identity then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can t be forgotten the effort seemed heavy handed as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring chaja s parents are given no human shades while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one dimensional and falsely acted the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence but is strong in accepting her faith topol s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can t love it starts out by showing how under chaja s loving care he s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away beginning by saying quack quack and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence refuses to speak because of his stern dad and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident the film thereby exploits the boy s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done i felt i didn t just see a movie but i attended a lecture for the whole minutes of this serious but unappetizing story it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily the message it keeps sending was already received in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past that seems strange since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about unless i was mistaken and the film s real aim was to make us cry over simcha 
this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground despite some good performances from a basically competent cast eddie sean penn and maureen robin wright penn are a not so happily married couple down on their luck living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city they spend what little income they have at the local bar owned by shorty stanton eddie s best friend and his wife georgie mazar maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie s frequent disappearances on his return he promises her the world and professes his undying love their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows as eddie disappears again like a junky craving the next high maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high their relationship is further complicated by maureen s pregnancy she wants the baby and the father but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter during one of eddie s absences maureen is attacked by kiefer her neighbor who gets her drunk with her cooperation and then insists on intimacy she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do not to her but to kiefer she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage he lashes out as she expects and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be months but in reality is years during this decade maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual joey travolta in a small role her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband and father of two children and stability joey makes a good living drives a cadillac and they live in a large house in the suburbs and the love of her previous life she chooses her past and sacrifices not only her new life but her old by giving up her and eddie s daughter to joey but the eddie that she knew is gone replaced by a mere shell of the man he was maureen is herself a mere shell more an automaton than a woman as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness or maybe the lack of sadness together but the movie s denouement was not convincing 
star wars episode i the phantom menace director george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel l jackson oliver ford davies terence stamp pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime min us distribution th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements copyright nathaniel r atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review i ve attempted to obey this rule in recent months but to do so would be impossible in this case the fact is nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people for me they calibrated my creativity as a child they are masterful original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release but that doesn t make me any less dedicated to it on the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back in particular are three items on a very short list of why i love movies when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine film series i got exited when i first saw screenshots from the film well over a year ago i embarked on a year long drool of anticipation and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving i was ready to see the film but then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilm s secretive snobbery over the picture in the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater i was tired of hearing about it i was tired of seeing cardboard cut outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell i just wanted to see the movie reader do not misunderstand i did not have an anti hype reaction the hype was unavoidable i understand and accept the hype it s just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released five minutes into the phantom menace i knew there was a problem who are these jedi knights i asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity why aren t these characters being developed before their adventures why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film these were just some of my questions early on later i asked where s the magic of the first three films and why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes by the end of the film i was tired maddened and depressed george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace is no star wars film take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time it s an embarrassment i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored or a new theme is examined or a special effects shot isn t used there are a few of each but they re all token attempts the fact is george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects this is not what i wanted to see i didn t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth but i did the story centers mostly around qui gon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has a line in the film and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people after picking up jar jar binks a completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august qui gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters there isn t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form the way lucas has handled it however it unsatisfactory first of all we don t learn one single thing about qui gon jinn not one thing what was his life like before this film well i imagine he didn t have one that s why he feels like a plot device this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role and why he s recently retired from film i don t blame him honestly obi wan a character i was really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting mcgregor has just a few lines so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed out character in the film and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting and when anakin says goodbye to his mother i found it moving also fairly good is portman and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i ve ever had to endure but he s more interesting than most of the humans as soon as the relatively brief segment on tatooine is over it s back to the mind numbing special effects and depthless action scenes i ve seen many movies that qualify as special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace is the first one i ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie the reason is obvious george lucas has no restraint i can t say that i didn t find the effects original because i did the final battle between darth maul obi wan and qui gon is visually exceptional as is most of the film but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome my breaking point was near the end of the picture as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters in the background we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky and i wanted that to go away can t we have one stinking scene that isn t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours and then there s the question of magic what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction i think it comes right down to characters there are none here i longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but i got no such thing and what about the ridiculous expectations mine weren t that high i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects instead i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show i don t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it i d like to forget that it exists and yet i can t it s here to stay i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they don t then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series 
there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see mission to mars there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind but there are those who will not and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies a space odyssey armageddon apollo the abyss close encounters of the third kind e t the extra terrestrial alien and aliens why because there is not one original idea in mission to mars all of it is cribbed from other films and in most cases better films if this is the sort of thing you don t mind you might like the film of course there are other reasons not to like mission to mars the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven t used their brains in some time and who don t intend to start during the film s running time mission to mars manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time the plot cribbed greatly from concerns a team sent to mars the first manned trip ever made to the red planet luke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith in that one was on the moon but when they try to study it a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station in a rescue mission is planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry o connell along for the ride after some zero gravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel now stranded on mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home after all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth mission to mars is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it so let s start with one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film that s it everything else fails the failure isn t de palma s fault he s working from an atrocious script only during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in where the rescue team s air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission to mars come to life a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire danger more danger attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film it s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes take it out and the plot isn t affected in any way the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes as does the rest of the film why is the ship s computer which sounds strangely like hal from uh able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine why did tim robbins character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside shouldn t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach why are the characters such idiots because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them all the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim it s too bad you can t go on this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this can t we find out these things in a less grating matter like maybe in a flashback the whole film is like that the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what s going on they must tell us exactly what we re looking at every time sample dialogue from the film shot of mars astronaut a look there s mars astronaut b you sure that s mars astronaut a yeah that s mars all right astronaut c hey are you guys looking at mars that exchange isn t actually in mission to mars but i wouldn t be surprised if it were for all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this film haven t learned to do something all those directors did very well show and don t tell de palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten this is mentally challenged filmmaking they assume the audience won t get what s going on so they explain everything five times over fourth graders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted the principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission to mars never managing to do away with an apparent i m just here to get a paycheck attitude cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines armin mueller stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance and sinise hams it up with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy handed monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolen from no less than three movies a lollipop to whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and sub par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then and of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission to mars but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow going leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters supposedly we re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the one character decides not to return ending of armageddon but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning me i alternated between the two there is only one good thing about the way mission to mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over 
nostalgia for the s continues as we see a revival of one of the decade s greatest achievements the marijuana comedy however half baked doesn t quite run with all its brain cells and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more the plot follows the misadventures of four ne er do well stoners there s the group s unofficial leader thurgood david chappelle scarface guillermo diaz brian jim breuer and kenny harland williams kenny gets into trouble when while on a munchie run feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse when the animal keels over he finds himself accused of killing a police officer and facing a bail his friends promise to raise money for a bail bond but have no idea how that is until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson clarence williams iii for a comedy the film is pretty humorless not that it doesn t try it s just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat the four leads are nearly all playing the same character only williams stands out while still performing on the level of his humor free comedy rocket man but that is because he s imprisoned throughout most of the film giving a much needed change of pace but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another to help out the film is packed full of cameos steven wright tommy chong janeane garofalo willie nelson snoop doggy dogg and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another none of them work beyond the simple hey that s level in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle not as his bland pothead lead but in his second role as a pot obsessed rapper sir smokealot granted it s pretty much a one joke role and there aren t a ton of laughs but this film needs every one it can scrape up to top it off and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film thurgood is given a love interest mary jane rachel true her role is that of the public service announcement to inform us why doing drugs including pot is wrong her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the your film promotes the use of drugs camp the film would have been better off by sticking with the rebel tone it so eagerly tries to claim yet in the end it doesn t really matter watching the film clean and sober you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is

this talky terribly plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux an ex new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder mystery after a light plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat he and his wife annie kelly lynch rescue a little salvadorian girl samantha lagpacan from the wreckage and that s when the trouble begins the other major players include a local drug lord eric roberts his scheming wife teri hatcher a soused stripper mary stuart masterson and a shady dea agent vondie curtis hall everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that s curious but never compelling based on the book by james lee burke heaven s prisoners is so badly plotted that entire scenes seem to be missing early on we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa later dave is reunited with a drug abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation huh the whole movie is like this perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf whatever the reason somebody should tell director phil joanou final analysis to recut this mess in its present form heaven s prisoners runs only two hours plus change but it feels like four 
the original babe was my favorite movie of a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience being a surprise commercial and critical success it had no marketing tie ins which limited its final take thus babe arrives with a budget greater than the money made in babe plush dolls vending machines hawking t shirts and macy s thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money grubbing too late this is a sad review to write because babe not only does not live up to the original but it doesn t even come to a fraction of it i shouldn t expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors magic but this film tries too hard and loses its charm consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity unaware that his car is in neutral imagine with me if you will scream s jamie kennedy explaining the rules for sequels like babe there must be more talking animals there must be more slapstick comedy there must be more songs for those mice to sing that s cute keep the story cards to break up the action that s cute too even though the pig gets wise made no sense given the context of that story partition there must be action however illogical that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to the baa ram ewe secret code the that ll do pig that ll do now throw in the limitations a james cromwell now a hot commodity has limited time on the set or maybe he didn t approve of the script b christine cavanaugh the voice of the original babe demands more money paltry considering the million budget out e g daily comes in with noticable results c george miller the director is more well known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment not for kiddie fare and no he didn t direct that andre film in d the special effects are impressive but limited babe talks but most of the time from a single shot repeated over and over again babe is center screen looking straight into the camera with a happy smirk regardless of whether he s happy or scared or tired season now with the original elements which as we will find out are straight from the screenwriting is hell bin i change the venue into the big city this has been praised as wildly original excuse me didn t home alone do this several years ago how about the muppets even the bad news bears travelled to tokyo sorry no dice side note to give the city a fairy tale look george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world s great cities and yes it is impressive but this too is over used repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions and for the most part babe remains in the hotel ii given the limitations of cromwell the human element is taken over by the boss wife played by magda szubanski s t r e t c h she s not a lead actress type she s not funny enough in her physical comedy and she s simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls have her arrested falsely on drug charges have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film the violence the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge head submerged underwater even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it as the brothers grimm have demonstrated no my problem is with the story or lack thereof babe is sent out to save the hoggett farm but once in the city that story is forgotten being a good natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice but other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull what did babe actually do without giving the ending away the farm is saved from a left field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig speaking of pig or pig pig pig pig pig the word pig is so overused had they changed it to an expletive and had the pig be al pacino i could have been watching scarface this is screenwriting further i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups had it been a cartoon and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd maybe my reaction would have been softened but to farmer hoggett his wife an elderly mickey rooney much too irreverent quick splice those singing mice into those scenes the film isn t a colossal failure i did like glenne headley s schmoozy chimpanzee i liked the pink poodle the dog on the cart who momentarily thinks he s in dog heaven and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly cast as an airport employee and a judge but most of the time i was looking down in boredom or in embarrassment over the hacked up script them singing mice those chapter partitions the proficient acting of the animals none of these can compensate for a story let me spoil the final scene farmer hoggett looks at pig proud says that ll do pig that ll do that s it hope i didn t ruin it for you but tell me this what the heck did that pig do 
late in down to you the lead female character julia stiles states her greatest fear is having an artificial conversation with her boyfriend freddie prinze jr the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out fallen asleep or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy the film is a multi million dollar testament to everything artificial filled with characters motivation plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles freshman co ed at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out doing the previous in how cute it can be the happy couple psychoanalyze each other they pick out a song because as prinze s dj mother lucie arnez explains every couple needs a song he smells her shampoo she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love then in standard romantic comedy style things fall apart why well because they have to otherwise the couple can t make up and live presumably happily ever after down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together or even knowing each other but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat the supporting characters are remarkably flat and insultingly ridiculous as well stiles best friend rosario dawson is a pot head prinze s roommate shawn hatosy is a girl crazy fool who can t meet women and then there are the porn stars zak orth and selma blair he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television does the college lecture circuit and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film you know the average porn star the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he s on screen the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes she is a porn star mostly so we know she s slutty so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted attempts at drama which means julia is going to cry include a pregnancy scare and the big break up these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes what happened here the cast is full of likable promising young actors stiles especially seems to be going places writer director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year s extremely unpleasant the story of us for teen audiences the direction is film school grad obvious it s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen a pointless parody of cops characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion plus the whole story is told flashback style narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera this is the second film in a row following wing commander starring freddie prinze jr which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she s all that if he doesn t start making better choices fast his future films won t be so lucky 
 houston we have a serious problem after making mission impossible brian de palma has a lot to live up to by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew he hopes to reach the modern audience and the possibilities are certainly there but the result is a great disaster starting in a near future with a prologue copied from apollo de palma slowly builds up his story the human race has already set foot on mars a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened this is basically the whole plot so it s hard to imagine that it can be stretched to hours but de palma manages to do that it is not a very good achievement as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space the hardest thing to do is stay awake the film s major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is david mamet s dialogue while trying to seem natural is distant and simply fake de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick s a space odyssey apollo and godzilla to make time pass the creators have inserted several refreshing scientific details that would not convince a half crazed frog it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp offs from several great science fiction films and stories when it finally presents an almost original idea it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity i can t even call this film predictable since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this sometimes it gets so cheesy that you ll start laughing when you re supposed to cry and cry when you re supposed to laugh you ll see enormous sandstorms hear mysterious sounds and last but not least on this constantly surprising tour you ll see an alien it s really hard to find comparisons to such an experience and i know that i ve never said that before i thought i never would but lost in space is actually better that s an achievement in itself director brian de palma has stroke gold with untouchables that became an instant american classic it is for this film that he will be remembered while all his other failures will be forgotten he ll live to fight another day i send the actors my condolences since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters and both the cinematography production design and art direction are very decent it is because of the achievement of people that i rate this film unfortunately their hard work was in vain if you have problems with insomnia i recommend you this film if you re not asleep within the first half hour consult your doctor 
what were they thinking nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough but do we really need an eighties film robbie hart adam sandler used to want to be a rock and roll star but in he s singing at weddings and having a good time a romantic at heart he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high school sweetie when she leaves him waiting at the altar his tune changes to love stinks he meets waitress julia drew barrymore who is engaged to a junk bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role but there is no spark barrymore doesn t seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it beauty but no attitude both characters are just there bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show the eighties are shoved in our face references to deloreans madonna dallas ivana and donald burt and loni and miami vice get old fast the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn t much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions they re not funny and it doesn t work with change on all fronts accelerating more and more nostalgia appears to have a great appeal but don t you think we could have more than years before we yearn for the past maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino michael redman has written this column for over years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be 
as the twin surfer dudes stew and phil deedle lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother yanking out his iv he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother s face this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney s meet the deedles a movie more to be endured that watched i stopped looking at my wife during the screening since every time i did she d start sticking her finger in her throat and she s right it is that bad directed without any imagination by steve boyum whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction the film limps along at best boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts stunts and more stunts amazingly for someone with his background he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones and we have a car go off the road five different times maybe more but who s counting and then there is the script by james herzfeld whose only other film tapeheads from a decade ago was so awful that it is considered a cult classic meet the deedles however is painfully bad rather than laughably bad it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes your geyser s a geezer and i d like to put a deedle in her haystack as the movie opens the twins who at one point describe themselves modestly as a walking kodak moment are celebrating their th birthday as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid back beach bums into men as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone they ve got their surfboards skateboards and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire their camp has gone out of business but they are mistaken for new park rangers the rest of the movie has them fighting the park s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex ranger played by dennis hopper who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration scheduled for later in the week hopper who has made some wonderful movies carried away being a recent favorite does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material this isn t his worst acting but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he s ever been in steve van wormer and paul walker as stew and phil give lifeless performances the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull to add insult to injury hennings is fond of inappropriate close ups which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog put a ten foot pair of lips on the screen and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie s stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road they make it look like so much fun that i m sure many will try some variation of the stunt how could this possibly be worst asks phil just when you suspect it can t the movie takes a turn further downhill its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag after phil s girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil they suck in a long worm like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp their lips finally meet in a kiss as they pull back their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around and up my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas both almost gave the show they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo 
bob the happy bastard s quickie review the odd couple ii grumpy old men it ain t hell my fellow americans it ain t walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years odd couple ii feels terribly generic where in the first movie made thirty one years ago feels like a wonderful tale that s like repackaging campbell s soup in a generic food can really how writer neil simon could ve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me throughout the movie i really didn t laugh once honestly i mean there were dumb situations yeah like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice but they just really didn t seem funny to me and that car rolling off the cliff the only way i would ve seen humor in that is if they were still in it and the ending gets all super mushy too in the final twenty minutes or so lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one then loses her matthau talks to his son a wasted jonathan silverman about his amrriage to lemmon s daughter and of course lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands ooh i really gave a lot away there i m sure consider it a hospitable gester you won t waste your time renting this muck 
a big busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch the great white hype stars samuel l jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay per view revenues is to invent a white contender peter berg to challenge his black heavyweight champ damon wayans the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs white than black vs black he may be right in an absurdly accurate way but the film doesn t give us a reason to care as a scathing sports spoof hype is just that unfunny unfocused and at times just plain pointless as a commentary on race relations it s even less effective the dialogue is the best of this mess lines like jon lovitz exclaiming i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang though we never hear enough of it the script isn t strong enough though to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin house party he comes across as absolute overkill the great white hype almost turns around at the end at the big match when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock concert proportions with costumed dwarfs gangsta rappers and the champ dressed as death only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should ve been 
when i originally saw the trailer for analyze this a few months ago i must admit i thought it looked kind of lame and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago i thought it looked outright bad but then when analyze this finally opened a few days ago an odd thing happened it got great reviews critics were proclaiming it hilarious and a dead on parody of mob movies well with praise like that i figured it must be good and so i headed off to the theater you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts well turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for analyze this is slow unfunny and badly acted don t get me wrong i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century but he is just out of his league here i think the problem is he didn t quite know how to approach this material he plays his character mob boss paull vitti somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama if he had played the character straight along the lines of leslie nielson in the naked gun series he probably would have been a lot more successful as it is though he plays the character completely serious at some moments and for laughs at others this doesn t work it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold you always know it s him and the movie is badly paced too it never takes off it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum i think the blame for this should be placed on the script it s obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist but once this is established the movie doesn t really go anywhere the formula of the film seems to be this billy crystal says no to deniro deniro forces him and much wackiness ensues this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie i ve said it before and i ll say it again the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it s funny if analyze this had been funny the pacing and bad acting wouldn t have bothered me i would have been too busy laughing to notice but as it is i only chuckled a few times the only really funny scene is a dead on parody of the godfather sadly though i don t think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody because i was the only one laughing but my sense of humour i have come to realize is vastly different from the general population i loathed there s something about mary yet loved baseketball now if you want a movie that i think is funny go out and see office space it s full of genuine laughs and won t leave you glancing at your watch every minutes as analyze this did 
mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it something else is what he did the film opens with a woman played by laura harring about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep meanwhile young vivacious betty naomi watts arrives in hollywood from canada she wants to build a career as an actress betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow she does not know who the woman is she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is they fix on a name rita for her but are not sure if this right or not meanwhile local director adam kesher justin theroux has problems of his own he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else cammie rhodes melissa george these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong there is also a strange character called the cowboy monty montgomery adding to the confusion in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing s style under the credits a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film he just chooses not to as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason there are no earthworms but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches the film is a little long for the subject matter toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes clearly not intended for the tv pilot unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a on the to scale and a low on the to scale mulholland drive spoiler warning i have rated this film fairly low you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film david lynch is in large part a dark satirist most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre what he does with this film is are you sure you want to read this playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on the first of the film he tells a simple multi thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something the audience expectation is that they will add up but he has given clues that are self contradictory lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories in fact the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation i think lynch is merely playing a joke there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties mad magazine called it a poiuyt other sources called it a tri pronged u bar look at small portions of it and makes sense look at the whole figure and it does not this film is in my estimation the cinematic equivalent of a tri pronged u bar

 from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews which i m guessing was said to get people to go see the movie obviously it hasn t worked since the million dollar movie has yet to break million to each it s own however since monkey bone is not only a bad movie all together but technically well made a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone a crude comic strip that everyone wants to merchandise they go to great links to get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder when stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in a freak car accident you ll see stu goes into a coma and while in his coma stu travels to i m guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come to life people are stuck in this town with their nightmares roaming around them when stu spots monkey bone whom he really can t stand he tries to keep him under control making a new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life when monkey bone and stu steal a pass monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu s body now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or something like that rather complex in fact more than it needs to be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development for instance we really don t get to know who stu or julie are so why should we even care kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her but we are not given a chance to know her the cast is decent however brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast dave foley isn t given enough to do as well as will grace s megan mullally who can be funny the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust the special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice to look at with the eyes some of them are believable and some unbelievable for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little you really don t realize that he is animated but on occasion it sneaks up on you the direction by henry selick is good but at times he doesn t know what kind of film he wants to make and the ending climax falls off the cliff it s too bad really monkey bone could have been a real good movie but with it s heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role for those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one 
an attempt at florida film noir palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels it s slow moving uninvolving and plain just uninteresting harry barber woody harrelson is an ex newspaper man just out of jail after being framed for a crime his luck hasn t been the best but things are looking up when a mysterious woman rhea malroux elisabeth shue approaches him with a proposition she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get out of her stingy but rich husband felix rolf hoppe at first all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone and to collect the money of which he gets to keep but as the deed is carried out things are not what they seem and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film but the effect never quite comes together it s got the sultry florida heat seductive women and even curvier plot twists but the whole thing smells of paint by numbers sure the right ingredients are there but the end result is much too artificial a lot of the problems lie with the script which though providing some genuine surprises is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations even the plot twists don t seem to flow well with the rest of the story some of them for example come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist for example harry s spontaneous job offer or the whole typewriter situation the characters are mostly lifeless played to type but not much more woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick headedness that it s hard to even picture him as an ex journalist elisabeth shue vamps it up but doesn t add anything special to the role chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance trying to be a sexy year old but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth some of the supporting cast notably gina gershon and michael rapaport give stronger but in the end meaningless performances and to top it off the pacing of the film is much too slow as the movie grinds to a halt you re given too much time to wonder why you re wasting it watching palmetto if you re in the mood for this type of movie you d be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir 
say tell me if you ve seen this before a crisis on board a commercial airliner causes a stewardess to have to fly and land the plane herself airport anyone ray liotta is a psychotic serial killer being transported from new york to california on christmas eve amazingly on what would seemingly be a busy day of travel on one of the most flown routes only about six other passengers are on the flight anyway they take off liotta escapes and kills all the police and the pilots and stewardess lauren holly locks herself in the cockpit to fly the plane the story is beyond routine the script is embarrassing at one point this jumbo jet is flying completely upside down the characters are worthless and the performances are annoying surprisingly co writer steven e de souza actually wrote the first two die hard movies turbulence takes place at christmas time yet the film was released a few days after the holidays brilliant marketing as no one cares about anything having to do with christmas after december th the studio knew they had a bomb and purposely dumped it out when the fewest number of people would see it r 
 something is fishy in the state of universal about ten years back with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior post apocalypse nitty gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies we ve always had movies of this nature on the beach the end of the world damnation alley the ultimate warrior and so on to date the most smoothly done were straightforward haircuts of the classic western plot like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization usually one in possession of some critical resource like water feed range or a mining claim most of these grew out of venerable but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn which was fairly well made on a small budget now we have waterworld which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter well she s not a widow and the kid isn t her daughter but you get the idea the lady is helen played by the stunning jean tripplehorn who isn t given a chance to be stunning or even interesting by the mediocre and unimaginative script the child enola played by tina majorino is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie she outshines her material all the way through in simple the scene is earth hundreds of years from now the polar ice caps have melted and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies and survive by trade theft or piracy somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries and its inhabitants called smokers are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials so the bad guys have outboard engines and fast moving boats airplanes and jet skis enola found at sea as a young girl has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical dryland the place where trees crops and animals grow and what plot there is hinges on who has enola the psycho ruler of the smokers the deacon is trying to get her and find his way to dryland played with typical self lampooning rug chewing histrionics by dennis hopper deacon is the only thing in the movie that s close to amusing his performance is almost laughable but there just isn t enough there to be funny the star and a co producer is kevin costner he s playing an un named lone denizen of the sea a man called the mariner who turns out to be a gilled water breathing mutant with webbed feet very little is done with this the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted much of the earth s surface would still be above water and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown canned meat does not last for centuries ammunition does not fire after it s more than a few decades old and so on and so on i m quite fond of tina majorino s previous work very impressed by jean tripplehorn s past accomplishments and still speechless over costner s dances with wolves but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it this movie cost one hundred and eighty two million dollars and there s nothing in it we haven t seen before done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey at minutes of material this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make the budget of this movie could have given us over thirty movies it could have paid for six years of a prime time sf tv series with expensive fx work or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx in sum this movie is beneath contempt it has nothing new to offer it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation if you have to go see it see it on a four dollar matinee otherwise you ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface for weeks 
it seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality it s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh jim carrey s signed on too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldn t take a joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn t funny it s not for lack of trying the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlie s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second independent personality named hank a deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster this guy isn t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he s been insulted or holding a little girl s head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks some have suggested that this isn t a problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesn t require plot to work they re wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort s there s something about mary s outside providence was technically an earlier project the brothers earlier film wasn t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected in mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight of hand trick they d have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work having been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes but they haven t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote by the numbers adolescent comedy the plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p waters renee zellweger who s in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that s entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love yeah me too the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven t already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value it s no longer funny merely gross the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlie s three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity of it all is funny for a while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face but by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn t been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn t been dropped either that s too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie s new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank s actions this doesn t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie s condition early on so they don t have any opportunity to be surprised by it the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn t go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax jim carrey is a gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in all of me it s a great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny carrey doesn t pull any stunts we don t expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn t give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren t set up in any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better zellweger s irene is not a strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed irene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she s ditzy clever or neither as such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for a movie like this he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked but i don t believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and i still think they are they ll rebound just fine even after that happens though i ll still consider me myself irene to be a high caliber misfire 
two party guys bob their heads to haddaway s dance hit what is love while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub it s barely enough to sustain a three minute saturday night live skit but snl producer lorne michaels clueless creator amy heckerling and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution s recurring roxbury guys sketch that would presumably make a good feature emphasis on the word presumably a night at the roxbury takes an already thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point and that of viewers patience levels the first five minutes or so of roxbury play very much like one of the original roxbury guys skits with what is love blaring on the soundtrack the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi chris kattan and will ferrell bob their heads scope out hotties at clubs and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts there is one crucial difference however these guys speak that little fact has been used as justification for the film s existence that the butabis newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren ferrell and kattan are new that s for sure but they all lead to comic dead ends there is no story per se only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots the brothers literally run into or rather get run into as in by car richard grieco of jump street fame and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club there they meet a hotshot club owner chazz palminteri conspicuously uncredited can you blame him who takes an interest in an idea of theirs meanwhile the bros overbearing father dan hedaya wants them to stop clubbing when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father a rift is created between the two the narrative messiness of roxbury would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny but virtually none of it is the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end alas the joke a rather lazy takeoff on jerry maguire will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film granted a lot of people have seen jerry maguire but the fact that the film s best joke is completely dependent on one s familiarity with another film says a lot about roxbury s lack of inspiration that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of saturday night live the roxbury guys is a one joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context after watching one of the roxbury skits on snl this is what you come away with from the characters they bob their heads to what is love bump unsuspecting women and that s all after watching a night at the roxbury you ll be left with exactly the same 
american pie is filled with laughs but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater i m no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the hit comedy but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself what separates american pie from its predecessor is heart of the original i noted it was a warm pleasant outing about the travails of growing up well the quartet of chums jim jason biggs oz chris klein kevin thomas ian nicholas and finch eddie kaye thomas have grown up at least they are a year older but don t seem any wiser fresh from their first year of college the quartet along with the obnoxious stifler seann william scott rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score as usual nothing goes right until the last reel but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women and american pie is rather degrading to women for the most part they are not shown as individuals they are nothing more than potential recipients of over active raging hormones it is telling that the most normal couple oz and heather mena suvari spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex she s overseas on an exchange student program despite having been to college jim is still klutzy and awkward unsure of himself around the opposite sex most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him including a painful episode involving an instant glue like substance also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates whom the boys suspect of being lesbians it is offensive and plays upon outdated adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs the first film despite some raunchy moments had an innocent charm to it the sequel is more cynical it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them the many mentions of finch s encounter with stifler s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy s return as jim s well meaning trying to be hip dad the only performer who is actually given some new fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle the band geek from the original in the sequel she imbues her character with vulnerability wisdom and maturity american pie is a pre sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office it is a shame though that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz who also penned the original could not have set his sights higher american pie is funny but it s still a comedown as well as a letdown 
man this was one wierd movie similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn t decide which genre it is the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship the last half hour this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it let s just kill everybody from then on forget sci fi this movie becomes horror what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare this movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore yawn everyone s seen it all before and knows when to expect it the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed but what did this then finally after being painfully restored the new crew views the video the acting isn t too bad at all considering what the actors had to work with anyway as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space this movie could have been so much better it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with there was just nothing new here that any of us haven t seen before in aliens or hellraiser 
you would think that this film s dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and americanizing it you d be wrong since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series rowan atkinson robin driscoll and richard curtis should you ever happen to meet those chaps do me a favor grab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear what were you thinking have you ever heard the phrase if it ain t broke don t fix it then walk away the film concerns mr bean atkinson and his visit to america while escorting the painting of whistler s mother to an american buyer played by burt reynolds in the type of bit part that his success in boogie nights should hopefully do away with now how or why mr bean is sent on this trip makes no sense and i can t even describe how the film explains it the point is that mr bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble problems problems problems where to begin first the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from beetlejuice or one note away from the score from rob roy then the song choices are totally uninspired good vibrations i love l a wow don t put any thought into that guys also bean makes way too much noise in the film the character doesn t speak much but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience and maybe the occasional murmur from mr bean each episode was like a chaplin silent movie in the film bean is constantly moaning grunting whining etc it s annoying and just plain wrong for the character the main problem though is that it s just not funny with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than minutes multiply that running time by three however and the laughs steadily decrease they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series sad and creatively lazy as a series mr bean only ran for about episodes or so why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything half hour episodes certainly hadn t exhausted all possible situations all i can say positively for the film at this point is that it s almost appropriate for all ages if it wasn t for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr bean is having sex with things and even that isn t a very positive statement please guys go back to england and go back to television so you ll make me laugh again pg 
certainly no one would rent ed wood s glen or glenda expecting to see a good movie but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn t know was possible in fact wood s infamous plan from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison watching glen or glenda i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together as a result it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary with endless repetitive narration about transvestites how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend s clothes without being able to wear them how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals and how the main character glen glenda is as it reminds us probably half a dozen times not half man and half woman but man and woman at the same time the camera work is terrible occasionally the camera lingers on say a closed door while the characters talk off screen or inexplicably zooms in on someone s ear or nose wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage which leads to voiced over non sequiturs like yes our world is a busy and frightening place with so many people driving their automobiles finally there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein style laboratory delivering pointless lines such as people all with their own thoughts their own ideas while lightning crackles quasi ominously overhead had wood continued in this vein glen or glenda probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror movie touch unfortunately he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script pull the string pull the string announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns this time warning us beware beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door it eats little boys and puppy dogs tails and big fat snails a bizarre nightmare sequence which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid ensues during which glen glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree in the living room someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister green dragon but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series appears to be orchestrating all this though the film is far from clear on this point to put it kindly near the end of this scene and here i must confess that wood lost me completely is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music after this scene ends not a moment too soon glen or glenda returns to its documentary style but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism but at that point it didn t matter much what happened as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over glen or glenda had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could it still might not match glen or glenda for sheer cinematic disaster i am giving this movie an f but i m not sure that quite does it justice 
a backdrop of new year s eve in would seem to lend itself to a great party movie the decor possibilities are endless disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic big hair was worth its weight in aquanet and the louder the fashion the better the look but despite this setting these details and a soundtrack that includes some plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade something is inherently wrong with cigarettes a better title for this nostalgic mess would be missed opportunities what is it that makes this retro comedy such a downer it s certainly not the cast which includes enough hot young talent for several movies there s courtney love cementing her reputation as a serious actress christina ricci hot off her shoulda been nominated turn in the opposite of sex paul rudd who gets even more appealing with every role kate hudson inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn and affleck brothers ben and casey two of the best things about good will hunting perhaps the question is this what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project maybe it looked good on paper cigarettes is composed of a series of vignettes as various characters make their way through new york s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica martha plimpton all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin rudd and his best friend lucy love busy bickering over his recent break up and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ben affleck who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick up lines more subplots many more dot the big picture but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick s cube ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants out to have a high time in the big city infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several scene cameo hudson as a pretty in pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies man jay mohr trips pukes and gets smeared with dog poop are we laughing yet the film boils down to a mixture of the good the bad and the gaudy with the latter two overtaking the former game performances especially by love rudd and plimpton are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other if this is cigarettes then get me nicotine patches 
if you have ever seen fox tv s special car chase programs you ll have a good idea about the content of ronin the new action thriller from director john frankenheimer the film involves a mysterious briefcase that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on an irish women dierdre played by the truman show s natascha mcelhone hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase among the people she hires are sam robert de niro vincent jean reno and gregor stellan skarsg rd from good will hunting dierdre s groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it they accomplish this task but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again the briefcase stays on the run as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie but failed to understand that just because there are surprises it doesn t add too the credibility of a senseless script the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on after the apparent climax of the film but to add to the excitement as i mentioned earlier there are endless car chase scenes they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story don t get me wrong i love car chases but they were overdone and too long here we never do find out what s in the briefcase but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller 
in the james bond film diamonds are forever tiffany case asks whether he prefers brunettes to redheads bond s response is that it doesn t really matter as long as collars and cuffs match well collars and cuffs don t match in the real blonde what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny meandering comedy on screen the film supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business is wafer thin it plays like an ally mcbeal episode dragged out to the nth degree replete with a few unnecessary fantasy sequences writer director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea it isn t the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary matthew modine plays joe a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent he s with no agent and no credits since he s too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas that s not really acting he tells his girlfriend of six years mary catherine keener with whom he bickers constantly about sex but they need the money so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video but it s not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike played by elizabeth berkley still trying to jump start her career after showgirls this points out how artificial this whole business is one supposes dicillo has referred to the real blonde as off kilter but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff the film which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere is remarkably on kilter and with perhaps the single exception of the always likable modine who s not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks the entire cast is vague and uninteresting catherine keener who s appeared in dicillo s previous three films including the brilliant living in oblivion is at her most annoying in the real blonde look at her closely she really can t act at all her reactions are all wrong almost always out of sync with her co stars she reacts too soon or too late to lines and situations she moves her eyes or her mouth far too much she frowns she yells she babbles she blows chunks maxwell caulfield plays joe s actor waiter buddy bob the one obsessed with dating a natural blonde bob s personality not to mention caulfield s acting ability parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera passion crest stiff and uninteresting maybe that s the point daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title a soap dish who beds bob both on and off camera hannah looks about fifty in this movie she s only why is that almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples why is that marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer and so on the best parts of the the real blonde are the beginning and the end brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog there s more depth and sincerity in a single close up of her expressive face than in the entire film while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it s funny 
synopsis cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy style ayla grows up to become a blond feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate comments allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci fi classic blade runner the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese it s so uniquely bad a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that it s oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel to this day the book possesses a loyal cult following i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother i have never read this book but i sure hope it s times better than its film adaptation if not then i m at a complete loss to explain its popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene a young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t tramps about in the woods with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audience s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla s mother a blonde with fur pants er leggings tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well as the earthquake slowly recedes a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven i won t detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point this movie is really stupid it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston the movie doesn t just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with a two by four a blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs she s of the new people they re of the old people with the memories yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up which surprises me the movie depends upon a lot of make up obviously but much of it is unconvincing as stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the characters have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the face painting that s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from its new age trappings maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the film s faux mysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you d expect to hear on a number and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated r though it s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i ve seen in quite a while it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous i m sure it s so cheesy that it probably won t bother most people the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie however as i wrote at the beginning of this review it does have the distinction of originality typically when i think of bottom of the barrel films dealing with early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though it s so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two stars i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however i m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie i shudder to think that it could be otherwise 
tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss he goes into depression and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ghetto side of every american city there lawernce attempts to steal his car but to no avail and is dragged along with robbin s on a trip to arizona there they hold up a store are mistaken for two other robbers just like in my cousin vinny and are chased by the police and the other robbers of course there s gags along the way usually from lawernce although the film is midly funny and quite watchable there s something so horribly familiar about it all this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there s lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop and pratically the same idea as midnight run it s full of all the road movie cliches and even has a comedy car chase which just seemed so eighties even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin or chevy chase eighties comedy there also isn t much chemistry between robbins and lawernce in planes trains and automobiles there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy in nothing to lose there is hardly chemistry at all towards the end the chemistry seems to work but for the bulk of the film there is hardly any the director directs the film in a workman like fashion but gets the jokes across and although there is no chemistry between the two leads they give good performances on their own lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance and robbin s is alright aswell however robbin s performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob s ladder and the player in fact if you want to see robbin s do comedy much better than in nothing to lose i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy where he is much funnier nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it however the humour isn t particulary sophisticated but if you enojyed dumb dumber you might enjoy this the characters in arizona are funny and there s also a good scene where robbin s asks a shopkeeper which threatening approach was better lawerences which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper s ass and swearing a lot or himselfs which was speaking in a deep scary voice but the gags are predictable the lack of chemistry infurating and the ending too far fetched and perfect nothing to lose then is robbin s first bad movie and hopefully his last and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film he nearly ruined carrey s career with ace ventura when nature calls let s hope he hasn t ruined robbin s or even lawerence s with nothing to lose 
there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do i delighted in the sneaky smart entertainment of ron underwood s big underground worm yarn tremors i even giggled at last year s critically savaged big underwater snake yarn anaconda something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth spent in the company of ghidrah the creature from the black lagoon and the blob deep rising a big undersea serpent yarn doesn t quite pass the test sure enough all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place a conspicuously multi ethnic multi national collection of bait excuse me characters an isolated location here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea some comic relief a few cgi enhanced gross outs and at least one big explosion there are too cheesy to be accidental elements like a sleazy shipping magnate anthony heald who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology or a slinky international jewel thief famke janssen whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold as it happens deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients a terrorist crew led by squinty eyed mercenary hanover wes studi and piloted by squinty eyed boat captain finnegan treat williams shows up to loot the cruise ship the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew a few survivors make it to the closing credits and up go the lights it s hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film making especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream here the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j o connor generally amusing as the crew s fraidy cat mechanic writer director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action horror menace something over populated with gore drenched skeletons something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we re expected to have a ridiculous good time not hide our eyes case it point comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda in deep rising one of the creature s victims is regurgitated back into view partially digested and still alive he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable in anaconda we also see a regurgitated victim partially digested and still alive he looks at another character and winks make no mistake deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing it s also gloomy uninspired and not nearly enough fun i don t ask much of my monster movies but i do ask that they act like monster movies you don t have to show me a fantastically impressive massive beast with tentacles a flailing just show me the massive beast burping and i ll figure you get the point 
look the new version of psycho came out and the world didn t end i guess gus van sant really isn t the bringer of the apocalypse unfortunately though that psycho didn t end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it van sant s controversial re telling of alfred hitchcock s classic film has polarized filmgoers everywhere even before it premiered without benefit of an actual viewing many have said that the film will at best suck being an almost good critic i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film at best sucked and that concludes the use of the word suck and hopefully the thoughts that i am a brain dead orangutan director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it shot for shot using the same exact script with a few minor alterations the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original sadly that did not occur it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin from the original psycho but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen in moore s case the film would have been helped if the x files gillian anderson had been cast instead especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence moore is scully mortensen who i liked in g i jane opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy hick which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point sam has a twang and a cowboy hat but that s about it mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory anne heche in the janet leigh role does a few good things in her brief time on screen at least her marion crane has a little life in her which can t be said for most of the rest of the cast the best work though comes from vince vaughn as the demented mama s boy norman bates he s not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins but he is effective both in being naughty and nice the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn where they simply talk there is some solid acting there something that is not carried through the rest of the film van sant has made a boring film all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in aren t as eye catching now what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don t impress or excite van sant in what i assume is a grasp at originality decided to put some stream of consciousness images into a few famous scenes was that a lamb in the middle of the road these images included with some questionable editing choices took away from the scenes themselves and caused at first bewilderment and later laughter definitely not hitchcock s intention at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann s original famous and terrific score if a film like psycho does not frighten then what s the point aside from norman the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting in the end however the new psycho is a noble attempt but alas a dismal failure 
i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part the best way i can put it is that it s funky i know this is an odd question but remember the opening music of police academy citizens on patrol when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song citizens on patrol during the opening credits it s just like that anyway part takes place a day after the events of part so technically still this time a group of horny teens who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life which must have been between parts and so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me she s the lone survivor this time part was originally shown in theaters in d and from what i can tell from the video it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects jason had long wild hair when he was unmasked in part now one day later he s completely bald also it being one day later it can t be friday the th now can it oh well steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series r 
play it to the bone the newest addition to ron shelton s sports themed repertoire fails in numerous ways like most of shelton s other great films bull durham white men can t jump this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots shelton s films are not considered sports films but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse the film has no social message like its predecessors the relationship between the friends two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for thousand dollars is very confusing for a number of reasons the whole film since it is primarily a buddy picture depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other unfortunately it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below we never see how cesar antonio banderas and vince woody harrelson meet the two are so different from each other that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something the third character on the trip grace lolita davidovich stands in the way she is in nearly every scene with them making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other there are two many interfering irrelevant side stories vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner these boring tales only hurt the central plot when it comes to time for the two men to fight they don t even hesitate to pound each other wasn t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with the film wants to be over shelton on the other hand continues to tell his story forty five painful minutes remain the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies however the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile kind of like the whole film 
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad so i didn t expect too much from this but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre i thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont i thought mabe it will be fun and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing but by the end of it i thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality here is the story in the monstrously over decorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation among them is a sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones a cynical dope owen wilson and a gentle and emotional lady lily taylor actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens but he gets unexpected help from the house itself it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights portals become veiny stained glass eyeballs a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture is that exciting or what the worst thing about it is that it didn t have to be bad it s based on a great book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson a adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses and with a mill budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush but why give him a more serious material in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bont s career as a director yet it wouldn t be fair to say that everything is bad the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky but this is where the good things end the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life it s nothing more than a special effects extravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn t engage at first you do not know what s going on is this part of the experiment are these hallucinations projections of the subconscience paranoia but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening the house is actually possessed it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window for ever i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that s what i got i believe hichock once said that it s better to wait for a climax than to see one this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid they are impossible to take seriously any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubrick s the shining are absolutely baseless shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid 
okay bear with me y all cause first off i have to get this off my chest what the hell is up with that damn crab whew okay cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end as cute as the crab maybe even i know that you need more footage than that and that wasn t the only thing getting on my nerves the cutesy gimmicks saccharine sweet score soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar as amanda and sean patrick flannery as tom might have held some appeal during oh say the first minutes of the movie at first the movie moves along at a quick interesting pace it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just doesn t die a ridiculous concept yes but at this point i m willing to accept it because i m willing to accept that this is how amanda s life is changed how her powers are received later on the movie can t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying they weren t just repetitive they were out of place and unnecessary the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development amanda suddenly becoming a great chef her falling in love with tom etc sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good some places the plot just doesn t make sense sometimes it s way too contrived the crab bit for example and sometimes too corny peaches emitting dry ice can t beat that all in all the plot seemed fragmented unconnected not romantic at all and only funny in some places so okay do the magic powers come from the crab or the fairy godfather she can float now too and all of a sudden instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches she can put her emotions into her food tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda s witchcraft in the end would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac s video what the hell is up with that damn crab it is unfortunate because i liked the basic premise of the movie until it became too fantastical and tiresome the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least a theme for a while but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and minutes of people crying at their tables the humor was good in some places nolan gets the funniest bits including that incomprehensible totally random thing with the dolls gellar and flannery are qualified actors and gellar has a particular charm but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy or even annette in the upcoming cruel intentions than this sorry excuse for a character it s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible the supporting character nolan was a highlight though he reminded me a bit of kevin in you ve got mail see footnotes and as always typical of a chick flick romantic comedy there s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background cued up at all the right places this sort of got on the nerves after a while too simply irresistible is not hard to understand light funny in some places and generally disappointing because it can t draw the line between romance and protracted sap between humor and tired slapstick and how could i refrain from making a pun simply irresistible is all too easy to resist first viewing did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to you ve got mail or the shop around the corner business rivals fall in love female counterpart s business is in danger of being shut down female as mother like figure guiding her the annoying hysterical ex girlfriends i really like sarah michelle gellar s wardrobe 
over years ago a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind s nuclear testing partly flight of fancy partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo a year later gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things a new name a dubbed english track and raymond burr as godzilla the film took on the rest of the world thirty years later toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things yes including raymond burr and called it godzilla now it s years after toho s remake and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run in emmerich s godzilla matthew broderick plays dr niko tatopoulos a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states meanwhile tatopoulos s college girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo works in new york city as an assistant to a big time news reporter she d like to be a reporter herself and when godzilla comes ashore she figures this is her big break of course with the big guy running amok in the city niko and audrey are bound to cross paths and are joined by victor animal palotti hank azaria audrey s trusty cameraman friend and phillipe roche jean reno an operative for the french government whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation s premiere movie production companies one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla he didn t right up there with the lost world godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history the plot is pretty much what we expect the big dinosaur like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city and it s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down the script however is painfully bad it s fraught with lines so corny they don t even belong in b movies and includes many character actions which make you think you idiot or you stupid girl i suppose when you ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them but is conveniently able to leap atop others why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line why do sidewinder missiles which have small explosive warheads blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f fighter bombers when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two okay maybe the last one was a bit nit picky but hey i was on a roll broderick is usually a good actor but in this film he s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way hank azaria does what he can but don t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage like broderick s azaria s character is quite simply lacking in color what really annoyed me was maria pitillo who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting casting must have been asleep on this one the one bright spot here is jean reno who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic quite unlike what we ve seem him do in the past although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable unfortunately the same cannot be said of the other incongruities the entire feel of the movie is tongue in cheek and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it this results in a significant amount of parody which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster and ends up just producing a mess most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens if we can t take the characters seriously the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don t care what happens to them godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light hearted than it should be far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters but here s a behemoth running through the city there s bound to be a lot of casualties but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after school g i joe cartoon syndrome where almost everyone seems to get out of harm s way just in time in a couple of scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire none of the characters even remark upon this ability nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers it s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes godzilla can do this just like in the old movie consider another punch pulled through creative script writing you can make a sequel out of just about any movie but the final scene in this one doesn t just leave the door open it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently it made me want to gag emmerich should have done away with of the humor and in jokes and played this one as a straight action film with an intelligently written screenplay godzilla could have been so much more however by confusing the viewer with a ton of add ins and parodies the movie ends up being something that just doesn t work now if they only had raymond burr 
synopsis blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs in the meantime someone sends sarah rotting flowers puts her name in the newspaper s obituary column and kills her cat comments never talk to strangers a colossal waste of time moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience minutes into the film one wouldn t think that two genuine movie stars antonio banderas evita and rebecca de mornay hand that rocks the cradle and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller saturday night live would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey not only are they in it however but de mornay executive produced it what was she thinking never talk to strangers centers upon sarah a psychologist examining the ill tempered max a murderer soon to stand trial she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood two men woo her tony the security consultant wins her over so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah and instead offers several male characters as red herrings minutes the running time of this cinematic mess thus seem like hours a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony why would the career minded professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony that s one of the film s mysteries which are never answered regardless of motive de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally in one of the stupidest scenes of the film tony takes sarah to a carnival that s right outside his dingy apartment that way they can hurry back and have sex quickly also apparently the weather changes quickly in their locale they re at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex the next day they re out playing in the snow before having sex the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah s character development someone is out to get poor sarah though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts rotting flowers a writeup in the obituary and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her suspense cliche number one also occurs whenever someone is stalked in thrillers by any means if the stalked has a pet that pet will die oftentimes to even further the cliche the murdered pet is a cat suspense filmmakers for some reason just don t like cats sarah in never talk to strangers receives a package and lo and behold discovers her mutilated cat within suspense at its very derivative as stated before never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay s bodies as often as possible comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here he s not given lines that are suitable for his persona and doesn t even appear all that much maybe in a way he s lucky for that early on in the movie sarah tells tony after meeting him in a supermarket that she had been advised to never talk to strangers allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker 
 some houses are born bad goes the haunting s tag line to which i must add some movies too nothing short of hiring a new cast a more literate screenwriter and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson s meritorious novel the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout boo fragile nell taylor bisexual theo zeta jones and smiley luke wilson are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders hosted by professor marrow neeson marrow s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house s bleak history he s not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew nell especially who has some ancestral connection to the manor s previous inhabitants taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big budget lead for starters her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes when we re introduced to the mansion and all its fun house trappings her character is supposed to be depressed having tended to an unloving mother for too many years but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame alternately grouchy mopey wiggy and pathetic and i kept wondering why the other characters didn t just ditch this bitch as for the obscenely photogenic zeta jones she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her unfortunately she s saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer theo s assessment of the house i love it sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters who on earth would say that in place of citizen kane meets the munsters furthermore would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description both actresses fare better than neeson who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble and for good reason and his character is the most bland as luke puts it dr marrow pulls the old academic bait and switch on his subjects but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he s accused later he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell it s amusing to hear neeson shout nell repeatedly given his starring role in the jodie foster vehicle of the same name why was this nice helpful and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti his sets are obsessively detailed and even before the cgi kicks in they seem alive never quite still i do have one beef with this aspect of the production the real life mansion used in exterior shots nottinghamshire s harlaxton manor is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins always finish up in locations that were established in act one as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting and despite a powerhouse box office debut i doubt it will recoup its costs including marketing domestically thank jan de bont for that proving for the third time that speed was a fluke in that it was actually enjoyable de bont has served up another ride sans thrill his images well lit though they are have an unmistakable been there done that quality in fact whole sequences not to mention the cloaked airy ghoul who owns the climax feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back peter jackson s the frighteners i don t mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist i mean to suggest that he s a hack having found no new ways to give us chills 
possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk it smashed u s box office office records in it s opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here but is it any good in a word no i ll elaborate further the story is as follows apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened see jurrasic park imgen the company that funded jurrasic park want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago realizing what a bad idea this is proffessor john hammond richard attenborough decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs so as to rally public support to preserve the island enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there so basically what you have is this two teams one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other trying to document them being forced to work together fighting for survival against the dinosaurs firm intentions on eating them a fairly good idea however it s let down by one slight problem it s crap over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring way too quiclky add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like what s for tea and should you cut the lawn later yes you should it s a shame then really that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c g i dinosaurs the t rex s have to be seen to be believed there is nothing else to recommend the lost world a very dissapointing sequel indeed 
walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids it seems that a woman has also been kidnapped she is the sister of one of them e t s henry thomas and the girlfriend of another flannery and the asking price is million which said snots are unable to cough up alone they even cut off walken s finger to show they mean business because they are desperate to save the woman s life suicide kings is a terrible film walken aside there isn t a single appealing cast member o fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance in an amusingly unironic scene walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to a tee it s as if he was reading the summary sheet for a casting director the plot is another issue entirely o fallon is someone whom i m betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster which is entirely unrelated to both the story and leary s character or the numerous anecdotal sequences but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses by the fourth big revelation twist i had completely tuned out wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material recently a peer a fellow young filmmaker informed me that he had an idea for a movie about four guys the mob and the fbi it occurred to me then what s wrong with indies like suicide kings i suspect o fallon has never met a mobster is not a rich man doesn t deliver endless clever monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots in short these guys are just riffing on other movies and in doing that making the same film over and over and over again tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantino s niche instead of carving their own reviewed at the toronto international film festival 
susan granger s review of session usa films sometimes you just get more than your bargained for like when boston based hazmat elimination run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant david caruso assures a town engineer paul guilifoyle that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week erected in deserted and decomposing since the danvers mental hospital is one of the most malevolent locations ever chosen for a film the structure is so massive with its labyrinth of rubble strewn corridors collapsing floors stagnant pools of water isolation cells and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre frontal lobotomies were performed that their task seems impossible within that time frame and each member of their inexperienced crew stephan gevedon brandon sexton iii and josh lucas is coping with his own personal demons as one by one their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they re working the film s title is derived from salvaged reel to reel audio recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities by the time session occurs so do dreadful disasters filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw massacre type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn t particularly scary the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing on the granger movie gauge of to session is a dark gloomy silly me at first i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs danvers the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock s truly terrifying rebecca that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley 
one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric you d better watch out for the skin deep i d like to extend the same warning watch out for skin deep but whatever you do don t watch skin deep skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards john ritter stars as zach a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big time drinking problem i never saw edwards comedy the man who loved women but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake you see to put it mildly zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets as the movie opens zach s wife alex catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress hairdresser like any sensible wife alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him in response zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking womanizing psychotherapy and self discovery if you re turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink get arrested have sex drink crash his mercedes have more sex drink get arrested again drink and sing horrendously at the piano then skin deep should be right up your alley skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters zach is a rich s l a version of ritter s jack tripper character from three s company like jack zach is clumsy and inept he s the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him consequently i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis in fact when zach crashes his ex wife s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony to add insult to injury edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work for instance vincent gardenia s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender of all the women in the film and there are many alyson reed alone stands out as zach s wife reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role because we don t care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep the film s few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail the comedy in skin deep doesn t fare much better most of the jokes are dumb predictable and sitcomish about every ten minutes however edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight gag the most effective of which involves a pair of dueling condoms overall the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism zach s excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain zach s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences if he crashes his mercedes he gets a new one if he gets arrested his lawyer bails him out of jail if his wife leaves him she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he ll clean up his act the tone in skin deep is all wrong edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or better yet michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep 
talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters spice world is the feature film debut of the pre fabricated pop band the spice girls it s intended as a sort of hard day s night but ends up simply hard to watch when watching the spice girls i m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick such as from the smurfs the snorks or teenage mutant ninja turtles in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles and about as talented there s ginger geri halliwell the brainy one sporty melanie chisholm the athletic one baby emma bunton the childish one posh victoria adams the fashion conscious one and scary melanie brown the one with a tongue pierced back so far you re almost certain the post sticks out her throat the film itself doesn t really have a plot it follows the girls as they travel here and there culminating at their first live performance at albert hall the action however seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas the various misfires include an alien encounter a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls the shooting of a spice girls documentary a movie producer george wendt trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie nearly all of which though incredibly far fetched seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up a meeting with a pregnant friend whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends a boating adventure a bus race club hopping wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd even when they start to sing and an assorted number of musical performances press conferences and general all around celebrity stuff whew for some reason the film is littered with star cameos from elton john to elvis costello from bob hoskins to meat loaf heck even roger moore shows up though he can t decide if he s parodying himself as james bond or if he s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld richard e grant has the largest secondary part a thankless role of the band s manager clifford the celebrity spotting is partially amusing and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film neither amusing or spontaneous when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring their songs are alright but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos my advice to fans is stay home and watch that video collection or at least spin that cd a couple of more times either option will be more enjoyable than the film non fans should know to stay well away from this one 
 the following review contains some harsh language but what did you expect when you clicked on this title cast kristen holly smith danica sheridan alex boling michael dotson sonya hensley janet krajeski sabrina lu dionysius burbano calvin grant jeff b harmon written and directed by jeff b harmon running time minutes the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside blatz balinski danica sheridan laments the fact that her lesbian lover april kristen holly smith has just received a telegram from her ex fiance isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot smith a resident of the small town of bumfuck arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson michael dotson when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home sticks a gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger instead of killing herself she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed except for lance the homosexual toilet cleaner slave april loves her new home and friends but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up mr and ms pfferpot director jeff b harmon and janet krajeski decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr sigmoid colon also jeff b harmon who claims he can cure homosexuality in actuality dr colon is homosexual as well and begins his special treatment on dick dickson unbeknownst to dick when april turns down dick s demand for her to return to bumfuck he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo style instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance alex boling and the two of them along with april and her lover blatz get married note to the filmmaker why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i m assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided april s parents feeling like there is no recourse call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer their way the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the circuitry and they re wire it and send it back to washington d c destroying it mr and ms pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own i m not sure if writer director co star jeff b harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs either way he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie the film opens with a preacher running a small african american child out of town and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan during a jaunty musical number preceded by remarks about gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others such as the jews if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can t help but feel like he had some serious intent as for the entire central theme of the movie i m afraid that it s one that i just don t get i tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non acceptance i m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but don t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me again maybe i m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully as far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy despite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day speaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells ain t ringing could have been a decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying i m a lesbian which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms smith it s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based the other performers are decent save for the rosie o donnell like performance given by danica sheridan i have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired one particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented anti nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film once the isle of lesbos reprise was reached i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indie underground com the transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately in many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like a rocky horror for the new millennium this film is by no means my cup of tea but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it if you think it might be for you then by all means seek it out i on the other hand will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator wait aren t gladiator films considered to be oh never mind 
please don t mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam i just want to warn all of y all not to waste your hard earned on anaconda it s not even worth a cent video rental don t listen to ebert on this one he has no clue what he s talking about btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was required to watch it on assignment she reviews movies for a local paper now i ll actually back up my huffing and puffing here goes movie anaconda rydain s bottom line wait for it to come on usa up all night even then i doubt it s worth the price of jolt to help you stay up that late why do i hate anaconda let me count the ways first of all this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong as an ophiophile snake lover i can tell you that a anacondas would never reach a length of feet b they re scared of people c cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake s mouth and constrictor snakes don t kill what they can t eat d people can outrun snakes with no trouble especially heavy ones like anacondas e if an anaconda did eat a human it would need at least months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal therefore it couldn t run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast and f snakes have no vocal cords so they can t make funny squealing noises whew i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it unfortunately anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn t give up and fall asleep he was the most likable character in the movie who wouldn t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman anaconda did have its cute moments arguments between ice cube s character and the british guy for instance however those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty eight minutes of boring schlock the writers had and blew a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny did she retort with a clever ego withering comeback of course not i m trying to work gee that s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with she could have told him to go find a knothole or something p but i will admit there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome hint it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks as for the plot i m still trying to find one this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous computer generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster than gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet harrier snake not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense in which the sick guy s g friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him that was about as clear and understandable as mission impossible if someone could explain that movie to me i d be most grateful all the old guy double agents looked the same i wasn t inspired by the acting save for the evil dude i can t blame the actors though it s not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with this concludes rydain s diatribe on a shameless exploitation and perpetuation of public fear of snakes comments flames anyone rydain the atomic cheese fresh from chernobyl dairies 
it happens every year the days get longer the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big budget blockbusters this year s crop already seems inferior to that of past summers even s lackluster trio of batman robin the fifth element and the lost world the marketing blitz in has been centered on godzilla heeere lee zerd lee zerd which doesn t make me optimistic about future summers godzilla is of course based on a series of cult movies translation really bad movies only a few people can tolerate from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner owned cable stations that this big budget remake won t rise above its roots is fairly obvious the credits show us the origin of godzilla in five words nuclear explosion creates giant lizard sounds like an enquirer headline doesn t it the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable discovery sequence this time a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling if that ain t a stereotype when he discovers the telltale radar blip people die cut to our protagonist played by matthew broderick he makes his first appearance wearing headphones warbling along to singin in the rain it s a none too subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie no dice bueller from the beginning poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla s enormous footprint every disaster movie has to have a know it all scientist and this time broderick is it as the world s leading expert on radiated earthworms and wouldn t you love to have that printed on your business card broderick is invaluable to the government he immediately dispels vicki lewis theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because hey you can t take seriously the intellectual arguments of newsradio cast members broderick instead hits the nail on the head announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard the radiation isn t an anamoly he announces and lightning strikes i believe this is a mutated abberation he continues and lightning strikes again it s vocabulary lightning you see activated by words of four syllables or more meanwhile we re introduced to our new york cast headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist maria patillo broderick s former love gee what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she s not ruthless enough nice doesn t get you anywhere in this town it s dog eat dog actually it s lizard eat city as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple s core the filmmakers provide us with a one note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla i think i ve got a bite he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him you can guess what happens next similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps one new yorker remarks please don t tell me that s another parade please don t tell me that s the best line you could come up with mayor ebert is not pleased played by the principal from head of the class he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option and bickers with his assistant gene i guess the filmmakers knew they d be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn t even bother to kiss ass the problem is if you re going to attack siskel and ebert you should at least make it funny dialogue like didn t we agree that we weren t going to have any sweets until after the election followed by back off gene just doesn t work for me other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character s last name and frenchman jean reno s inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york there s even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses as the beast heads back into hiding broderick suggests the military lure it out with food cue twelve dump trucks all dropping fish into a new york intersection broderick that s a lot of fish that ambush fails but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them yep godzilla s with children which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla that s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually like linda tripp godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day so it has a lot of dumb action scenes destructive special effects and shallow subplots look no further than patillo s betrayal of broderick patillo what have i done animal what have i become and the climactic godzilla s nest sequence in madison square garden the main difference is independence day was about the experience it had a real global patriotic element to it and some genuinely fun characters godzilla has lots of rain and lightning reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak blockbuster juicy fruit swatch sprint and bumble bee tuna yes bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie 
this review contains spoilers but believe me i don t say anything you can t guess minutes into the movie i did go into this one with high expectations i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film boy was i wrong another garbage slasher flick the only difference being that this one has a story the story you ask well a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk he takes it home somehow getting it past customs and starts fiddling with it in his attic lo and behold after he takes it apart three demons appear and start taking him apart but with meat hooks when they re finished his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling they botch up their cleanup job however and manage to leave his heart or some gland i didn t really recognize the organ under a floorboard the guy s brother and his brother s wife appear at the door soon after and decide to move in they throw away scumball s belongings and set up house turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage she starts having some wild hallucinations later hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards slow mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground all from the tiny cut on his hand said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball s organ the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing it establishes mind contact with wife who agrees to help him get more blood because she really wants to be screwed again so she helps him kill three businessmen scumball at this time gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back problem is he doesn t have any skin and even after three or four corpses still doesn t get any skin he finally gets some though but strangely enough he ends up looking like his brother guess they couldn t get the original actor back who knows scumball whose name is frank is not a nice guy he describes his torture by the demons fondly as the ultimate pleasure and pain since at that level there is no difference between the two somehow i don t see getting torn apart by fish and meat hooks a lot of fun this guy is so bad how bad is he so bad that the rats cower in a corner in fear for good reason too he crucifies two of them for fun and carves a third while the nympho s horsing around with hubby anyway hubby s daughter who if course is not wife s daughter starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams the dumb bimbo meets scumball and is not impressed she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle and brings out the demons at any rate the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup they re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake the demons are not however the good guys the dumb bimbo s the good guy she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank but also banishes them to hell or oblivion we re not too sure which not too shabby for someone with single digit iq this is basically a bad jinn story it is an awful movie awful acting bad focus in the photography many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks which is really unrealistic and looks like the latex that it is continuity who cares acting terrible script horrible sounds canned unrealistic story is so so but the impact is lost long long before the film ends i do think the rat acting was quite good i have never seen rats look afraid they should get nominated for an award really good acting there the best in the movie the envelope for best furry rodent please a rating would be far too generous a rating or in the to rating system is far more accurate this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen had to have something to do dumb dumb dumb movie i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself lots of slime and red dyed corn syrup does not constitute horror in my opinion 
in tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather was it deep nope however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was without the comic book uplift of the indiana jones and superman pictures which was true if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man s escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place if those films were tom sawyer then batman was huckleberry finn some critics glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone realized that it was something special mr lovell gave it and wrote that this is batman as batman should be mr travers called it one of the ten best films of the year the praise was deserved from start to finish the film was enthralling exciting and superb in every respect there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes the villains the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman take over and our epectations are always left unfulfilled when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman s nose he simply gets mad and when we want catwoman to slither over batman s body she gets pushed off a building i admire mr burton for trying to do more then entertain but the result is a mess nothing works out as planned it fails both to entertain and to enlighten hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast alas these are only hints there are don t misunderstand me several moments of cinematic genuis contained catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said christopher lloyd is trapped by the penguin within a giant cage a small basket is dropped into a large river but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis a weak followup both career and sequel wise batman returns is sometimes dazzling but to often dissapointing 
america s favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in bride of chucky and their unholy matrimony is something old nothing new the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers however has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood soaked honeymoon the answer is a sick and twisted yes and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot enough to melt rubber or at least singe it lovin guess they re anatomically correct chucky again voiced by brad dourif of course is the star of the child s play series a my buddy type doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer in bride the plot heh picks up with his girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly resurrecting chucky s remains he was blown up at the end of child s play with the help of a black arts manual called voodoo for dummies silly mortal before long she s also been reduced to shin high figurine status and the plastic incarnations of these one time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk a young couple nick stabile and katherine heigl with conjugal plans of their own leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical soul transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait along the way our murderous barbie and ken go through post marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds bicker argue kiss and make up but when they squabble over who s going to do the dishes watch out hey even faux people have got to work through their problems director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing when one of them charges it s nothing a good forward punt couldn t take care of and when a climactic chase scene is needed one of the dim bulb protagonists must pick chucky up so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending will son of chucky be next and this is a bizarrely bad minutes at the movies as is the thing to do in post scream slasher cinema don mancini s screenplay slathers on the in jokes and genre parody but little of the humor succeeds proving self reference can be completely worthless when it lacks bite to be fair though most of bride of chucky is on auto pilot so it s not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film similarly shaky the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland the effects aren t that special and the story is one big groaner here s hoping chucky and his entire clan past present and future rest in peace 
don t get me wrong i tend to appreciate besson s naive unashamedly romantic worldview an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood his leon is exciting and absurdly moving thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman and s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love l u v that s even more of a hoot on repeated viewings but his joan of arc is a mess despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself jovovich besson s own personal muse through the making of his last two films though they ve since separated is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior but also a fabulous supermodel level babe and besson remains a servicable action film director though not an especially facile one leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english joan s struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring and besson helps you understand how the french could believe fervently that god is on her side besson s big mistake i think is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject yes joan had visions but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue eyed christ figure on display in besson s hallucinatory dream sequences the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman billed as the conscience shows up spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell babbling like ally mcbeal that s kind of a shame since she does quite well up to that point charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness that darkly attractive aspect of her character that she s as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord is more or less betrayed by the final reels in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she s overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who s about to take a fall as the story winds down with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance trouble is he s chosen a lurid often jokey tone for the balance of the picture including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes and it s impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is to a great extent nothing more than a put on this glib pre fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer s the passion of joan of arc a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan s trial and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema compared to that film the messenger plays as a crime against history directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france usa theatrical aspect ratio 
so i went and saw this film right it was called battlefield earth i was never interested in the previews and never too terribly interested in the book nor do i find scientology interesting but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is i had that weird urge just to watch it well let me be the first to say and so far in my view it s safe to say battlefield earth might be the worst film i have ever seen yes even worse than mr magoo blue in the face or jaws the revenge roger christianson whos credits include set direction and art direction for such great films as alien and star wars directs this film with such amateurism that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb that it s quite depressing the look of the film is dark and drabby at times but then bright and happy at other times the sound is terrible and has the worst surround sound effects i ve heard the acting is nothing the dialogue poor and the make up effects hideous here s the so called plot earth man is a endangered species while aliens from the planet psychlo the aliens are named psychlo i wonder why are invading earth destined to put an end to those man animals to an end and destroy earth once and for all of course we have our typical hero played terrible by barry pepper who was great in a small role in s the green mile who is destined to go out and save his planet one thing he has to go up against terl the chief of security psychlo who is played frankly quite bad by john travolta whom with dreadlocks a big head and green eyes just doesn t work of course the sidekick to terl is played by lol forest whitaker who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind our friendly human johnny barry pepper looks just as bad as well with long scraggly hair i m not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film except just to say it s terrible everything in this film is imcomprehinsable from the make up effects which by the way aren t good to the phony looking special effects everything in this film is faulted in fact i don t remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time or enjoying myself in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed throughout the entire minute running time i was dying constantly looking at my watch and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something sadly it didn t my advice to hollywood get new scripts new acting classes better directors and damnit make films like american beauty more 
capsule silly and inane adaptation of gibson s short story which is nowhere in sight gibson s script only adds insult to injury johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie i say awesomely because it s one thing to fail but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged keanur reeves who is terrible stars as johnny an information courier who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head he is given one last job whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words run which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories but it s only followed up on in a token fashion for his trouble johnny gets chased by the yakuza who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high tech thrillers what s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made in japan there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics but of course there s no room in this movie for any of that the yakuza are simply used to point guns wave swords flaunt tattoos and grimace menacingly i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies bound by honor sugar hill and american me come to mind when asians remain perpetually stereotyped but that s another essay anyway johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark why newark maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york that s why there he meets an assortment of odd characters ice t dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture it turns out what else that the data in johnny s head could save a lot of people but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn t kill him handled right this could have been absorbing but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other better movies blade runner and brazil come to mind everything looks run down and scummy everyone dresses like they re punk rockers and videophones are commonplace snore the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un technical fellow would think it would look and behave like a hacker of johnny s caliber would be blasting away with one command line function after another instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms but of course that s not cinematic whatever what went wrong with this movie gibson wrote his own screenplay which i guess is part of the problem what works as a short story doesn t work in a movie his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn t advance it convulses from the script on out it was probably all downhill renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless there s no fun in kicking a wounded dog is there 
stallone attempts to act in this cop drama the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal who s nephew played by michael rappaport is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths keital dosen t really want to get involved in anything gets rid of rappaport and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on this film should be brilliant it sounds like a great plot the actors are first grade and the supporting cast is good aswell and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance however it can t hold up although the acting is fantastic even stallone isn t bad the directing and story is dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long with nothing really happening in them in fact the only scenes that do work are action scenes which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid in this film serious means dull the dialogue is warbling and basically just repeats the same points over and over no matter who is delivering them the plot which has potential is wasted again just being cliched after a while in fact the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro both delivering their usual good performances however stallone although not given much to say gives a good performance however it s not all that bad as said above the action scenes are well done theres also a very good ending which uses the cinemas sound system well in fact the last minutes of this hour film are one of the best endings of if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending cop land then turns out not to be a power house film but a rather dull and not every exciting film hugely disappointing and i can t really recommend it 
the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride and it s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year s finest films so naturally when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found this notion left me puzzled it is a rare thing for a children s movie to be praised this highly so wouldn t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly magical piece of work a tad bewildered but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films i sat back for minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind having great expectations for the film looking back i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater believe me i wanted to like babe pig in the city the plot seemed interesting enough after the events that took place in the original babe the sheep pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon but after a fateful encounter with a water well arthur hogget james cromwell who the movie could have used alot more of has been rendered bed ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially the only solution that his wife magda szubanski going from delightfully charming to downright annoying can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair i think and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public problem is the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded city a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion setting the main plot in motion mrs hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright here is where the film took a wrong turn up until this point i had being having a rather enjoyable experience the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs hogget is accused of smuggling drugs unfortunately the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel none of them being even one tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe the main topic of discussion surrounding babe pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children and i believe it is at one point a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown at other times we are treated to surrealistic flash backs to mrs hogget s full cavity search at the airport in fact the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing however that is as they say neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half let alone entertain a child another problem i found with the film was it s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story if you re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel fine it may not be my cup of tea but at least it is a noble ambition but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs hogget swinging from wall to wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls it just didn t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining and the same goes for the rest of the movie 
 gordy is not a movie it is a minute long sesame street skit and a very bad one at that this movie is so stupid and dumb that it s depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie i m sure children are the target audience of this movie but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy voiced by garms whose family has been taken away to up north which we know means death of course we can hear the animals talk to each other and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible actually it s almost funny in a way the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears a little girl named jinnie sue macallister young who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it what is the point of this maybe she is one of the producer s relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce roescher who is sad because his divorced mother is dating he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue but he accidentally falls in a pool probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a suit on nah didn t see that one coming starts to drown and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank s grandfather the original ceo dies and leaves his fortune to hank and gordy of course there must be a villain but even this villain donadio as sipes isn t that evil he never raises his voice or becomes angry and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story it s hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film or if the filmmaker s are just this untalented and stupid at times gordy is tolerable to watch thus earning it one star and not the dreaded z but it s just so unbelievably boring cliche dumb unfunny corny and just plain bad it may scare children it certainly disturbed me see also babe 
steve martin shines but sgt bilko fails to impress based on the popular s sitcom sgt bilko follows the string of old sitcoms to movie conversion fever remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy but the tv conversion movies are hitting our screens like wildfire sad to say with mixed success such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie sgt bilko frankly i have not seen any its original tv version even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd failed to entertain sgt ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool place of vehicle storage and repair of fort baxter though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money making opportunities from running a gambling den in the military garage to d pools though materialistic in mind bilko s methods has thoughtfully enriched the lives of the men of fort baxter providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn blissfully confused state bilko has managed to hide his operation though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it bilko s state of ascent is suddenly under fire when the pentagon sends major thorn a tough cookie on army regulations to check on the progress on the million hovertank project a new weapon under development within the fort s grounds to add to his problems thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major sabo done on him by bilko during their younger army days director jonathan lynn who directed my cousin vinny in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best supporting actress managed to pull sgt bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter but that is about it there are really not enough laughter packed moments in sgt bilko to fully entertain the average movie goer still steve martin s sgt bilko is played with finesse and full force by the renowned comedian without him sgt bilko would have just fell flat on its face sgt bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world the current trend in mixed successes in such tv conversions may be a blessing in disguise really at least it will force hollywood to re think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity unless you are a fan of the tv series or love to watch steve martin in action you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres i m sure there are better ones around 
ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film i have a problem even regarding it as a film it s more of a show a big commercial for ted turner s world championship wrestling wcw the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page goldberg and sting the story is very minimal and basic there are these two guys gordy david arquette and sean scott caan they are two twenty something wrestling fans from wyoming when they go to a live event for the big match up there favorite wrestler jimmy king oliver platt is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus joe pantoliano gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus plans on the way they meet some people have some fun and clean up some port o potties sounds great huh well it s not the movie makes many attempts at humor only a few of them work the jokes that make you laugh however do not outnumber the film s many duds there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette s tag team partner is macho man randy savage they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl the cheerleaders of the wcw she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan s breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face now what didn t work in this movie that would be the rest of it the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets the two lead characters work for a port o potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck the excrements spill all over the road it s not funny it s pathetic and brainless the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle like that would happen to any fan especially to that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set also i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily they just walked right in i like wrestling i watch it at home and laugh it s continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn t watch it this movie wasn t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently the movie was too dim witted to be funny it is possibly the most useless and under developed film ever a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film detroit rock city that movie was interesting well done and continuously funny unlike this film the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh now that the scream trilogy is over arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb call att ads at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox he s in the funny parts of the film but there aren t enough to make him look good the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock s bawitdaba and cowboy martin landau has a great cameo as a classic hard nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real the wrestlers form alliances go to people s houses and beat them up it s utterly ridiculous the whole film was a wasteful dumfounding experience the movie was made to pay homage to the fans telling them things that made wrestling not the wrestlers the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying dollars to see a potty humor movie the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two hour commercial to watch it if you re going to watch wrestling watch wwf it s actually entertaining the wrestling is betters they re funnier more diverse and have better entrance themes oh and the girls are hotter is this what movies have become hour long commercials that you have to pay to see don t waste your money 
as a hot shot defense attorney kevin lomax keanu reeves has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients he is also an excellent judge of character knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness s testimony and on top of that he s a damn good trial lawyer in the opening scene it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty but it doesn t hamper lomax s desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt thereby getting an acquittal his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country headed by john milton al pacino he is brought to their headquarters in nyc where he immediately impresses milton and is subsequently offered a full time position as head of their newly created criminal law division lomax is soon given the case of his life he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell he works late defends the guilty pledges his soul to his firm and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife mary ann charlize theron but what starts off as a promising john grisham like story about conscience stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story it begins like a typical parable where a small town boy makes it big but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money power and greed but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm quite literally he is the devil in disguise and as the movie progresses he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago freaky and frightening things begin to happen and after much of the film has elasped milton s horrifying intent is finally revealed the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big city trial lawyer the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax unfortunately the two never mix well into a cohesive story and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere granted the film is very handsome looking you ll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino you ll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties you ll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away this was one of the better storylines but unfortunately is only a sub plot as with all thing s involving the devil you can expect nothing but the worst in the first few scenes reeves anchors the film but then slowly drifts into the background his path from self vanity to self consciousness is never fully explored his actions seem arbitrary and his reasons for them not fully known pacino s comical portrayal is spirited but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie there is another plot or two that is introduced but never gets revisited the focus seemed inconsistent throughout and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap this movie tries to be horrifying thrilling and dramatic all at the same time however while the devil s advocate strives to get noticed ultimately it makes very little impression at all 
tri star rated r language sexual situations violence minutes director and writer darren stein cast rose mcgowan rebecca gayheart judy greer julie benz chad christ ethan erickson carol kane pam grier tatyana m ali review by geoff berkshire jawbreaker is the very definition of a rip off this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie heathers and clueless and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich s along the way writer director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo judy greer about the four most popular girls at reagan high courtney shayne rose mcgowan who can basically be summed up as satan in heels julie freeman rebecca gayheart a good girl with the face of a supermodel marcie fox julie benz a dim witted blonde who demands that people call her foxy and liz purr charlotte roldan an angel in disguise liz is everyone s favorite because she s both beautiful and kind liz is about to turn and as a prank courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney s car but when they open it later polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment their lives will never be the same poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz s dead body courtney thinking fast decides to pass the death off as a rape murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into vylette hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students up until about this point the film is effective enough however an investigation begins into liz s death and the film becomes excessively dull the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch courtney s plan to frame a sleazy guy marilyn manson in a brief cameo is never believable for a second meanwhile the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack chad christ he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid fern s rise to popularity is equally lame we do get the best scene in the film the only one with a spark of originality during this section it s a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school s resident jock stud dane ethan erickson to demonstrate using a popsicle exactly what he would like for her to do to him it at least provides us with a look at courtney s personality but the way the scene finishes doesn t make any sense stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting william katt and p j soles students in carrie are liz s distraught parents jeff conaway from grease is julie s creepy single dad and carol kane the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls camps it up as principal miss sherman at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema s greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color director of photography amy vicent who beautifully lensed eve s bayou does a remarkable job here as well shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive performances are mostly sub par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments compared with her excellent work in the doom generation and scream and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress singer tatyana ali who has a small role as a cheerleader the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like auto stud college stud and high school stud the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen s catchy yoo hoo makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film

would you believe in real life i mean that if you were julia roberts that you d be the ugly underdog to your sister the creepy catherine zeta jones let me tell you what reality is reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot that s reality america s sweethearts is the opposite of reality a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also ran presumably because she wears horn rimmed glasses and used to be overweight uh huh the plot follows two married mega movie stars gwen and eddie zeta jones and poor poor john cusack whose material gets worse every year on the eve of their new star vehicle s release a film called time over time the only problem gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation and the press and public have not been forgiving think meg and dennis gosh and the director has vanished with the film holding the only print hostage veteran pr agent lee billy crystal is called upon to clean up the mess throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie presumably distracting the stupid stupid film critics into forgetting they haven t seen the movie at all note to sony any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab and did i mention gwen s sister kiki roberts is along for the ride and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way oh billy you re a scamp the script you ve co written with peter tolan what planet are you from and bedazzled need i say more is a roast of hollywood and celebrity sure but it s not a funny one yes crystal tells us hollywood is lying to our faces if you are surprised by this you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine it s about to expire aside from a scant few zingers yeah se or winces rules america s sweethearts jokes aren t funny its pace is choppy and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project not for headlining star julia roberts but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself i didn t time it the movie s not that bad but it s crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film bad move billy your jokes suck the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie s gags and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene how this movie earned a pg rating is a mystery to me julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend s wedding into a winning film but not even that tooth smile can save her here obviously aware of the ugliness before him director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria as a lisping spaniard christopher walken the insane time over time director and alan arkin a new age guru in a fright wig to crack wise none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken azaria comes off as a preening queen when he s supposed to be macho as for roth in case you don t know went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio revolution which produced this work he s back behind the camera for the first time in years it ll probably be another before he s back again i could drone on about how america s sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies but that would get old instead i ll settle for discussing the movie s worst sin that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable not just in its plot but in its sentiment every single character in this film with the arguable exception of kiki is simply hateful and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains when you leave the theater you ll ask yourself too why would i want any of these jerks to be happy 
plunkett macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking used properly it can save a movie see stigmata but it ruins this one making a muddled incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise there are certain genres that just don t go together the film opens with a sequence that i still don t understand it involves some sort of prison outbreak a robbery and a gem that keeps being eaten in any case the caper whatever it may be brings together plunkett and macleane robert carlyle and johnny lee miller respectively two happy go lucky brits with no way to make a living they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca liv tyler a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name gentleman highwaymen lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ken stott who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals meanwhile macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett who doesn t want his plans to be foiled by his partner s mindless romantic travails director jake scott son of ridley scott alien blade runner has his father s knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid jerky way that it s impossible to comprehend what s going on the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention deficit disorder edits he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut the weird almost defiant lack of dialogue there are no no conversations lasting over say seconds undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different emotionless and unrealistic when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style quite frankly blows the film has no hope of succeeding on any level i wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but i couldn t it was so kinetic it gave me a headache 
capsule dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones basic instinct s worst crime is that it s not just a bad movie but in many ways an incompetent one as well it s stupid in itself and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is it s supposed to be a thriller but the plot is dead on its feet and ultimately arbitrary it s only put into the movie to jerk us around it s also supposed to be sexy but it s instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures it s a ripoff the story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm the biggest suspect is an authoress catherine tramell sharon stone who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged or maybe it s the work of a copycat these and other plot threads get fed to the detective who s on the case michael douglas who has a few problems himself like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor we can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance joe eszterhas has written the screenplay and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge the killer s identity is kept a secret until the movie s final shot this isn t in itself a problem the problem is that up until that point we ve been given nothing to work with every clue in the movie every clue is ambiguous the whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill red herrings dead plot threads violence and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets they add up to zip because they re not happening to people we care about douglas s character is foulmouthed and bitter and that s it stone s character has an iron on smile that never changes the rest are forgettable when we don t even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie who cares what happens in it especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying but in many ways inexplicable a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know or would care to know just leave one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone s life but as a kind of kink something to thrill men with i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism 
i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews and in both instances he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon now i personally remember those films as a starring a major motion picture star b being funny c having great action sequences d great chemistry e decent character development hmmm okay now on to my review of chill factor plot a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex army general to propose a nuclear device to international prospects when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps they must keep it cool on ice and rush it over to an army base before the contraption ticks over degrees fahrenheit and kills millions of people critique speed on an ice cream truck is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one tone movie to its backers but unfortunately the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension filled original two hours of cinema is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film and the lethal weapon movies stood for this film is seasoned in cliches with plenty of badly written dialogue over the top acting from cuba gooding jr zero chemistry between the two leads and horribly tacky bad guys tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously written that we just had to crack up that and the formula for the film s script which followed the proverbial and you guessed it scenario and what about all those catchy hip names to get us to relate to the characters elvis and nighshift oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters and yes it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr got involved in this one week old blue cheese smelling project did they actually think that it would boost their careers or did they know that the script sucked but discounted any fall from grace knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall most probably the latter have you seen either fled or bulletproof well despite the slight differences in plot the essentials are basically the same here you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people having no choice but to work together to get somewhere hating each other at first but over time learning to respect one another as individuals yawn add to that the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black drive black cars and black vans and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head not too conspicuous eh call me a party pooper but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy this film just doesn t even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island do not a fun buddy action flick make show cuba the money everybody little known facts about this film and its stars this is not a little known fact or anything but damn is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great looking actor johnny depp skeet s real life nicknames include chester skeeter and mosquito he stands was born in north carolina and got married in to that sex kitten actress from clay pigeons georgina cates they own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs skeet has a long scar on his chest from open heart surgery done when he was to correct a ventricle defect actor cuba gooding jr was born in the bronx new york in he break danced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles he stands actress hudson leick who plays one of the bad guys girls in his movie is better known from her role as callisto on the popular tv series xena princess warrior this film reportedly had a budget of million i m not exactly sure where all this money went but it certainly did not register onscreen interestingly enough director hugh johnson who makes his big screen debut with this film was the cinematographer on the film white squall and the demi moore vehicle g i jane 
yeah yeah the advertisements didn t even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook sex neve campbell and starship trooper s denise richards getting it on ok yeah it s a decent two minutes of film erotica but even if that s your main interest in this film there s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing or at least curious to see the next turn throughout the entire movie but this fast paced razor sharp turning of events doesn t leave much time to enjoy the surprises we start off in a high class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making guidance counselor sam lombardo matt dillon seems to catch the eye of every student particularly kelly van ryan richards daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts right off the bat kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce mr lombardo the fund raiser car wash seems the opportune time particularly when you wash your guidance counselor s jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you ll be soaked from head to toe when you re done on the weekend of the car wash kelly s attempts at seduction fall flat and when they do she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low class marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller campbell comes forth with a near identical story also involving her trusted guidance counselor pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney ken bowden played by bill murray yes that bill murray sound like a good complete movie yes that alone could have been but this is just the beginning in fact the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time by the time the movie finishes you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable unfortunately with so much going on you re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could ve been the minutes fly by and although it never feels underdeveloped this pretzel of storytelling could ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime time soap operas which no is not a good thing and it s not just campbell who happens to hail from the prime time fox soap party of five but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones dillon who was so charming in his understated role in last year s in out gives the best performance and murray s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film in fact if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy even if it was the exact same film i would actually give it a better grade that s how cheezy it comes off but aside from these two the rest offer nothing more than some good eye full s in the right hands wild things could ve been a wickedly delightful scrumptiously twisted thriller but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting and what s up with these people passing as high school students i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles but when i realized it wasn t supposed to be a college they were at i had to snicker i won t lie this is definitely a guilty pleasure as corny as it is it s got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a b for effort but if you just want to admire denise richards go for last year s starship troopers which was every bit as campy but a million times better of course if seeing her breasts is your most important goal you ll be right at home with wild things perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters 
in french the phrase film noir literally means black film webster defines it as a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music classic film noir including such memorable fare as the big sleep the original cape fear and orson welles striking a touch of evil employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre color came into play with neo noir films like chinatown and blade runner l a confidential easily the best film of is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo noir filmmaking for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo noir and create an absolute mess there s palmetto based on just another sucker a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase palmetto shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance director volker schlondorff tin drum the handmaid s tale stated we weren t even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy it shows palmetto is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy the story begins when journalist harry barber woody harrelson is released from prison someone turned state s witness and revealed that harry was framed a reward for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto bitter and broke harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over but ex girlfriend nina gina gershon appears to return him to palmetto while hanging out at a bar he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth harry pockets her cash only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket no problem though the radiant blonde is rhea malroux elisabeth shue the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems and she has a proposition for harry rhea needs a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny the girls want to bilk a half million dollar ransom from the old man and will happily give harry for helping with the scam things go wrong of course odette is found dead leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks in an ironic twist harry is asked to work for the local d a s office they need a press liaison to field questions about odette s kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job not a bad set up for a noir film if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material but he never settles on a consistent tone the actors don t know what to do with their characters either muddling the proceedings even further as if that wasn t enough the story suffers from major problems in logic woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts but he s lost here presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme harrelson clearly doesn t know what to do with harry s character so he spends most of the film glowering sweating and generally acting miserable meanwhile elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide as the stepdaughter chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr despite a number of steamy scenes there s no chemistry between harrelson and the women to make matters worse schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character s lips are running over each others bodies two particularly bad scenes highlight the film s problems while driving with a body in his trunk harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up the officer wants to help change harry s flat tire and asks him to open the trunk harry s pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy but under schlondorff s grim direction the scene is just embarrassing the film s nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina we re supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip had palmetto been played with tongue firmly in cheek it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story but under the harsh direction of schlondorff the film is just a sluggish paint by numbers exercise in neo noir cluelessness avoid this nonsense and go see l a confidential instead 
the tagline for this film is some houses are just born bad so i didn t expect too much from this but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre i thought liam neeson cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont i thought mabe it will be fun and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing but by the end of it i thought why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones jan de bont these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality here is the story in the monstrously over decorated mansion known as hill house visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor liam neeson into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation among them is a sophisticated bisexual cathrine zeta jones a cynical dope owen wilson and a gentle and emotional lady lily taylor actually the doctor is researching the primordial fear reaction and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens but he gets unexpected help from the house itself it rumbles hums and belches forth remarkable sights portals become veiny stained glass eyeballs a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real placing an emotional wall between audience and screen the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture is that exciting or what the worst thing about it is that it didn t have to be bad it s based on a great book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson a adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience the blair witch project that cost less than an old car managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses and with a mill budget de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is in itself frightening he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush but why give him a more serious material in the end haunting will only haunt its fledgling studio dream works skg and de bont s career as a director yet it wouldn t be fair to say that everything is bad the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated beautiful mysterious magical and spooky but this is where the good things end the music is blaring the floors moving the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life it s nothing more than a special effects extravaganza visually impressive but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn t engage at first you do not know what s going on is this part of the experiment are these hallucinations projections of the subconscience paranoia but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening the house is actually possessed it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window for ever i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that s what i got i believe hichock once said that it s better to wait for a climax than to see one this may be true and it might actually work but there is only one problem jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary only stupid they are impossible to take seriously any paralells that you might have heard before linking this picture to kubrick s the shining are absolutely baseless shining had class style story acting but most of all talent and originality haunting has only special effects and art direction to boast of and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film casting good actors for small pale parts only makes things worse but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write most of you will see this film anyway even if the tagline would say some films are just born stupid 
capsule annoyingly unentertaining obvious and paper thin buddy cop drug sexy witness movie presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock i ve seen this movie already i said as i looked at the box art no i haven t even seen a trailer for the movie i don t even know what it s about but i can look at the way they re promoting it and i know i ve seen it already i thought it s about these two cops and they re buddies sort of they re at each other s throats a lot but they really do like each other and everyone else in their department hates them cause they re hot shots and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship and one day they re in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying and the bad guy is a drug lord and there s a witness and she s this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down i only missed the bit about the badges the rest i got dead on and i hadn t even left the video store yet the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money martin l is a family man shades of the now tired lethal weapon dynamic here whose wife and he are at total odds this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence s not getting any and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house thinking his partner is now his wife s back door man not funny tiresome bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence will smith is a natural and i m happy to see him in movies like six degrees and men in black he s funny and charming without trying to be he really does seem to be enjoying himself martin lawrence is a different story he s so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial movies like this are not about originality i know this they are about style and energy and synergy between actors i know this too and yet while watching bad boys which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography i felt fed up i d seen con air which despite being completely implausible was still great fun because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix bad boys is a dry run and overlong too clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by play than i felt could be justified i could write this movie you could write this movie many people have many people will continue to write this movie over and over again other people will buy it from them and make it and we will pay money to see it more the fools we all in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly phil k dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger as he called it would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other the same could be said about this movie i have the sinking feeling we re going to see it again soon 
tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi tiered marketing materials for crap movies and here he hits rock bottom with planet of the apes i didn t expect much from this latest interpretation of pierre boulle s classic novel planet of the apes i mean how could you top the force and impact of the original film intelligently co scripted by rod serling of twilight zone fame combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those damn dirty apes in one of his best roles of his career sadly i sat down to watch burton s version of planet of the apes and within the first minutes i was checking my watch and my girlfriend a big fan of the original film started to nod off this time around the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine braveheart and project x marky mark wahlberg who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter plays leo davidson a hot shot u s air force pilot leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms no real explanation given in the film and leo sends one of his genetically altered smart chimps into the storms to collect data leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp leo hops in another ship to find the monkey and then he s thrown through some type of time space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo paul giamatti who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari helena bonham carter the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo s ship along the way monkeys played by tim roth overacting his role of a vicious general named thade and michael clarke duncan who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages just like battlefield earth in the end it all culminates into another braveheart rip off human versus ape battle scene while rick baker s makeup work is amazing the script is a pathetic hodgepodge courtesy of three writers the acting is horrible and the surprise ending feels like a swing from a ball peen hammer into the temple wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences this remake or re interpretation as tim burton has proclaimed it is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film the ethical arguments about the equality of species fascism and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue an unimaginative narrative structure and a romance between a monkey and a human even chuck heston s anti gun tirade in the de rigeur cameo seems shallow and jokey but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america john badham could have directed this film even joel schumacher could have directed this film he probably should have burton s predominant themes of rejection isolation and the search for one s place in the universe as seen in ed wood edward scissorshands and pee wee s big adventure are completely absent in this planet i suppose that s what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole 
young einstein is embarrassingly lame but that didn t stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia where it became the third largest box office hit of all time in the u s warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan inxs and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under personally i m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious who not only wrote produced edited and directed the film but also starred and did his own stunts his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you d expect from someone named yahoo the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein s youth whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania a remote australian island in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity albert invents surfing bubbles in beer and the electric guitar yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick a clown with an insatiable curiosity although yahoo s performance is at first endearing the one dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e mc yahoo has created a charming family for albert and the scenes on tasmania are often clever but after the first twenty minutes the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack unfortunately the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video the instrumental score on the other hand is generally playful yahoo uses such classics as the overture and the theme from the good the bad and the ugly to great comic effect halfway through young einstein i knew for sure the movie was a stinker but it wasn t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies such as young sherlock holmes but from cheesy prime time sitcoms in fact young einstein might have been more at home on network television where its sophomoric humor wouldn t raise any eyebrows 
sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things and pushing tin certainly features some name stars who are going places billy bob thornton cate blanchett angelina jolie and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first but he s actually the veteran among this quartet of fine looking people sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has hip comedy written all over it compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits compensate for clich d characterizations compensate for embarrassing you have to be joking situations etc in pushing tin thornton blanchett jolie and cusack don t have an earthly from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble squiggly quirky credits fake looking passenger planes circling new york and anne dudley s in your ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for the full monty let alone won it but i for one wasn t ready to walk just yet so quickly we descend into a tightly edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job yes what with their frantic mile a minute instructional personas juggling planes and passenger s lives like some huge real mid air video game hip cool demonic auctioneer nick the zone falzone cusack is the best in the biz of course until some hipper cooler leather clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell thornton shows up to challenge falzone s finite air space boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding then the macho one upmanship begins it doesn t stop with seeing who can juggle three s within a cat s whisker of each other oh no there are some broken hoop dreams some wanna see how fast i can drives and then the ultimate showdown was that my wife i saw you with last night director mike newell four weddings and a funeral must have read a different draft of this script because the one that s being acted out up there between newark jfk and la guardia doesn t have an ounce of subtlety and newell has made some awfully good and funny movies before the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe they ll make you frown in disbelief they ll have you constantly looking at your watch but wait there s still minutes to go the film s only saving grace is blanchett whose connie falzone is a spunky brash long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red headed australian gambler oscar and lucinda and a tempestuous british monarch elizabeth but she s not enough to save the picture thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke jolie as russell s knock em dead wife isn t bad but the up and coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything cusack cracks gum dons shades and acts hip throughout but like everything else in the film his performance is forced in the last ten minutes or so for some inexplicable reason things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been like the trailer teases but it s too little too late a fine cast aside pushing tin is nothing more than an embarrassment 
my giant is two movies for the price of one but neither is worth the cost of admission even if you get in free as lamely directed by michael lehmann the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book without goliath david is just some punk throwing rocks languidly paced throughout the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer the omen meanders toward its sad ending since it s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery other than a few nice visuals there s nothing to recommend the picture with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally to the original city slickers billy crystal has shown that he s more than the world s best oscar host he does however have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year s father s day and this year s my giant one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie s somber tone the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day this one joke movie s single idea is to place real life basketball player gheorghe muresan who stands seven and a half feet tall into as many visually striking situations as possible sammy crystal an agent currently without clients is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max muresan after throwing out constant one liners either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car sammy decides to get serious seeing max as his meal ticket and although he doesn t like it he s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half dozen dwarfs the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever after a series of missed opportunities the comedic part of the movie is over and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie we learn that max s condition is terminal and he will soon die to be fair the movie does contain a few good scenes all of which you can see in the trailers let s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie my giant runs too long even at just it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up my son jeffrey and his friend matthew both gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it matthew pointed out that it is not as good as it could have been or should have been amen he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was 
there s only one presidential election every four years but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as the thriller of the year in we ve had absolute power air force one shadow conspiracy and murder at this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford trying to bring us a complex plot of cover up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys here s what happens this time it s night at the white house a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt the next day she s dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in how do we know he s a hotshot we ve seen the traditional action flick opener the clever hostage negotiation scene it s not so clever this time consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street snipes is off to the white house where he finds the secret service head the shiny bald head of daniel benzali won t cooperate with him at all in fact if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda snipes wouldn t have been allowed in the white house at all alda helps snipes out further assigning a sexy secret service agent diane lane to act as his liaison a very dangerous liaison well not really i just wanted to say that almost immediately a suspect is found an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos snipes doesn t buy it and launches into an independent investigation of his own one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president s son snipes partner an always wisecracking dennis miller calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane who at first doesn t believe snipes eventually and predictably comes around and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information for the first hour or so murder at looks like it could be going somewhere interesting sure we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon snipes and lane don t make for a bad action team but with nothing to work with they re just cogs in the bad movie machine dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie they waste his talents more in murder at than they did in bordello of blood and that s saying a lot when you get to the last half hour the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer busting out the old break into the building underground climax and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why you ll wish you never sat through this movie at all the in the movie s title doesn t represent an address it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide serving the world for nearly th of a century 
bats is this year s camp flick with the world s worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity as for the rest of us well i d say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway follow their lead and you ll spare yourself minutes of your life and bucks to boot i love alfred hitchcock s the birds almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based it saddens me even more then to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror schlock such as bats when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town the authorities call in a batologist dina meyer to investigate it turns out that a creepy scientist bob gunton has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab making them smarter and more vicious why has he done this you ask because you see it is apparently a scientist s job to make things a little better even if that means the death of all mankind so the batologist her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff lou diamond phillips have to kill all the bats and save the world of course that can t happen before they wallow in some guamo bat shit for the uninitiated get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture consider for example a scene where two people are in a bat cave the bats are all sleeping but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out what do they do do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can nope they stand there for a while transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes we don t even get to see what s going on the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick all we know is that bats are attacking how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies and bats sure could use some of course director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor but it is so conventional it doesn t really go anywhere most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist s wisecracking sidekick leon who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like i hate bats some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one liners playing such characters does not help actors careers still i suppose that if you re looking for a movie that is so bad it s good you could do worse than bats it does have a tremendous amount of camp value i m not recommending the movie because quite frankly it sucks and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it more power to them 
warren beatty diane keaton goldie hawn and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsom s version of the classic romantic screwball comedy in town country the drawing room farce of the s dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action back then impossibly wealthy scions of society with too much free time would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers only to have everything come out all right in the end see the philadelphia story for a great farce town country has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work and sexual misconduct on several levels but there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is t c s downfall there is obviously a great deal of hollywood talent in front of and behind the camera involved in town country but without a likable or at least interesting story to carry through their efforts it is all for naught and that s what we get here naught porter stoddard beatty is a high powered new york architect with a very good life indeed his year marriage to ellie diane keaton appears on the surface to be perfect but there are cracks just below this pristine surface his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts his kids don t need him and his best friends griffin garry shandling and mona goldie hawn are in the midst of a divorce porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late but like a man fighting against quicksand his struggle just sinks him deeper at the minute mark of town country i asked myself what s the point i wasn t entertained i laughed three times over silly little pratfalls and spent most of the film marking time til the end warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head keaton s ellie is an empty headed flake who can t see the obvious as porter screws around on her and as you get to know them who would want friends like griffin and mona the supporting cast is given nothing to do and sometimes does harm to the film given the material they are forced to use nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling the actress who has eerily failed to age over the years is miscast as the air headed musician and the character doesn t belong anyway jenna elfman is a sweet but smart ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress is there any other kind in this movie who comes on to porter the saving grace is a pair of quirky perf s by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowell s very strange parents glib rationalization of infidelity like if he doesn t speak english it doesn t count are a staple for the screenplay the morality of the film seems to be if you can get away with it go for it the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn t want to know never mind befriend the actors do their best but are hamstrung by the weak material helmer chelsom who made the outstanding offbeat comedy funny bones is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on town country the production values are high as one expects from a big budget hollywood film but the opulent sets by caroline hanania lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and top notch photography by william fraker cannot save town country the film has had a long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better for me anyway if hollywood just said no to this movie i give it a d 
die hard is an altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior to the original in every respect place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson who wrote the film s pathetic screenplay every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor the plot is altogether implausible the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land the film has zero credibility and all of the characters come off as cliched cardboard cut outs so much for the script how about the action well let s put it this way director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan who directed the original as well as the hunt for red october and predator all standouts for their hair raising suspense by contrast harlin doesn t have a clue when it comes to choreographing action and consequently die hard never picks up steam die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute in fact the movie often seems deliberately campy and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it s good you do laugh but you laugh at the film not with it die hard should have never been cleared for takeoff 
jet li busted onto the american action movie scene when he stole the show in s lethal weapon with his wicked looks his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma it only took another two years for mega producer joel silver to set him up in an all american movie primed to take over some of the empty action hero seats left by alleged coke head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts namely chow yun fat and jackie chan let s find out plot rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another when members of their respective families start turning up dead that s when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother s death and to exact some of his own style of revenge critique three words not enough action simple enough not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay bad actors crappy dialogue and oh so many over the top melodramatic moments and a romance angle why one must ask why i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences and jet well the poor dude was barely in the movie and i thought this was supposed to be his big break how bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung fu fighting chops slap him in a few more scenes and give him more chances to practice his acting english abilities what a letdown even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up empty shell of a film in fact i am sure that more time was spent gathering the hits for the soundtrack of this film than were on the so called screenplay i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn t matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines but no save lindo and aaliyah who weren t too shabby i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some year old looking guy acting like he s the overlord of a drug ring what a mess then again i don t want it to seem like i m complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway not the story well i guess that s what disappointed me the most out of this film there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving also as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt it should be seamless fellas not necessarily against the laws of gravity the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow but that simple creative touch couldn t save the rest of this film s uninteresting plot movements i m disappointed for jet li that this film didn t give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes hopefully the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor for now i just hope that for his sake the film s title isn t a premonition of the movie s ultimate fate at the box office 
movies can do the two big es very well educate and entertain in the best of all possible worlds they accomplish both on the red planet they fail entirely in the near future a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be after some mumbo jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does the ground crew of people you couldn t care less about is trapped on the surface without food water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog the one potentially interesting character carrie anne moss spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer attempting to graft esque space mysticism with terminator robot horror first time director antony hoffman can t seem to figure out what s going on neither can we didn t he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story couldn t he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter there are so many mis steps every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction why introduce the theme of faith vs science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die offscreen the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen two hours later they re still waiting despite our greatest hopes there is no life on the red planet 
robin williams has the rarest of gifts the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style overwhelmingly his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best with the notable exception of flubber so when i the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams tell you that not even williams can save his latest project you know it s in trouble jakob the liar is a confused muddled little movie a generically uplifting film with a fundamental contradiction the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn t realize it williams plays jakob haim a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high ranking german officer for his punishment jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately seconds of a radio broadcast the announcement in english but punctuated by a triumphant heil hitler is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob s ghetto liberation he thinks the next day jakob tells the news to his closest friend a volatile prize fighter named misha liev schreiber who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along soon it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home a crime punishable by death this is absurdly false but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate the danger of course is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger in a curiously irrelevant subplot jakob finds a year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered and goes to great length to make sure of that just why the idea frightens him is never made clear he and the girl build an uninvolving generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren t met the results are far worse than if there was no hope that s the film s biggest detriment it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false it s never moving because it doesn t give us anything to be moved by jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing robin williams doesn t inject the film with life as a matter of fact he seems a little out of it as if crippled by his fake accent he is stragely unenthusiastic his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless hopeless not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent this isn t the robin williams we know and love in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it here he is more of a wannabe serious actor an impostor jakob the liar will be compared with last year s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a holocaust comedy it s not a comedy it tries sometimes but it rarely works is it a melodrama a war movie a character study no no and no jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can t be placed into a category not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts 
 bicentennial man is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment chris columbus the director who gave you mrs doubtfire plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point based on the short story by isaac asimov it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human which as you can imagine is very difficult starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children soon this robot called andrew robin williams shows abilities that makes his owner mr martin sam neill very curious andrew is interested in art and music he enjoys making clocks which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions it shows out that because of a small failure in the electrical circuits and positronic brain andrew has accidentally gained a soul this makes him unique and his evil creators worried then mr martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn t programmed to do soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom destiny and love this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction ever since that film the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy what makes us human the thoughts the emotions is it possible to become human at what point can we say to a robot now you are one of us these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach it is obvious that columbus didn t take them very seriously when you think about it this film is not really meditating on the question when is a robot no longer a machine but a human being but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being and only the society has troubles with it in other words it is as far from reality as from the academy awards further more there are other annoying problems to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than years from now this has not been done for obvious reasons because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task columbus is the first to have crossed that line the result is as you might imagine primitive unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort the world is simply frozen in time neither the society fashion culture or values have changed over years mom is still working at the kitchen doing the dishes when you think back to the late th century and then compare it to the world we live in today you ll see a slightly bigger difference i am not saying that everything should change it is unlikely that the human rights will change but it s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science technology and fashion i suppose it s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale but it s really hard robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way as always he does a decent job as does sam neill but it doesn t really matter it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience pretty much like last year s meet joe black this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn t deserve great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten when isaac asimov wrote this story the future seemed far away and magical everything seemed possible now is the future of asimov s time and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne s leagues under the sea so can t we accept this story as a potential reality let us hope that next year s a i will be more rewarding 
in gia angelina jolie plays the titular character the first so called supermodel and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome in my eyes anyway i just don t see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film despite this i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie sadly though my fears were realized it s just not possible to make an interesting full length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes the movie follows the rise and fall of gia no last name a tumultuous woman who doesn t particularly enjoy the world of fashion she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high losing a job and going into rehab this formula is repeated several times and i really got tired of it in general i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use no because it offends me or anything like that it just bores me quite frankly i don t see the appeal so when a director shows me a point of view shot of a junkie complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices i am left somewhat unimpressed the first hour of the film though was actually quite engaging we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend these early scenes were interesting we re shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes and it was a perspective i hadn t seen before the movie begins to go downhill however once gia becomes an established model from that point i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end it all seemed so excessive fine so gia had a drug problem does this really need to dominate the film couldn t the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world quite possibly although since i have no desire to become a model this warning is lost on me as i stated at the beginning of this review i simply don t see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature length motion picture what do they do that warrants a movie strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players for example but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life gia did not and by the end of the film all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling was bi sexual and was heavily into drugs not exactly a meaningful contribution to society as far as i m concerned 
depending on who you ask the original sin was either the eating of the apple the act of disobedience against god or the act of betrayal but in case you didn t know this don t bother remembering it the words original sin never come up in the movie of the same name let alone the concept of it the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba circa regardless of its senseless title original sin does actually have a plot albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war based on the book waltz across darkness boy antionio banderas places personal ad sometime around searching for a wife since this is a century ago we narrowly dodge a remake of green card only to find that the girl jolie faked her photo and is actually beautiful skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes getting the question out of the way yes we get to see angelina jolie s breasts again the girl turns out to be a con artist swindles boy for his money and heads for the hills original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller we see boy go whore chasing saying he wants to find girl and kill her but as soon as boy actually finds girl instead of following what might have been a promising or at least not completely fucking boring thriller the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin whore complex since milk money girl toys with the idea of reforming her con girl past all the while avoiding the other man a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect and acting roughly the caliber of a b b gun and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year don t even bother with original sin but if you do go be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block it s much worse than a sin this is sacrilege 
and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners not rating anything lower than your standard this movie sucks along comes this cinematic atrocity and he s forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick even the bravest movie goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time yes despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie the latest highlander doesn t seem to have anything going for it oh stinky movie let me count thee ways plot from what i understood a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal or something along those lines critique a complete and utter mess disjointed incoherent boring corny filled with bad dialogue and that s just the first thirty minutes this film doesn t seem to know what to do with itself it s confusing to anyone who doesn t know the series i include myself in that group and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series i include die hard highlander fan the arrow in that group the film doesn t explain anything about itself it just goes from one inexplicable situation to another one moment they re in the present time the next moment they re in italy in the s why who knows what are they talking about no idea flashbacks mixed in with the present mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene hullo confused yet i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story random swordplay mad max like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the s or were they in the present at that time who knows and to be honest who seriously cares this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago but sadly someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it please please for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie making and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film put this series to bed and end it even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material but all he could come up with is plenty of slo mo action some fast motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere and is there anything spectacular about the sword play or fight scenes nope and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close ups yipes the man is not aging gracefully is he oh boy and i haven t even gotten around to the greatest piece of over acting that i ve seen in years the man who plays kell in this movie bruce payne should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near overacting is not a hobby for this guy it s a living he s also very funny not purposely though all in all the movie stinks nuff said 
brian de palma the director who bought us carrie dressed to kill and mission impossible is back and has bought all his technical expertise with him sadly he forget to bring a good story and believable characters nic cage plays rick santaro a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne sinise an assassination takes place and santaro tries to peace together how it took place trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together however the film doesn t keep the mystery for long and once the big secret is out concerning kevin dunne the film is at a dead end although there are some fantastic shots by de palma including a minute steadicam shot at the start of the film halfway through the film drops dead the problem is that de palma doesn t have a strong story or characters to work with he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience and i quickly got bored nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters but it s no use they are boring faceless and completely unlikeable yes another problem with the film is that there s no one to root for we re supposed to be on cage s side because his character becomes nicer throughout the film however his change is sadly unbelievable poor gary sinise s character is terrible who completely changes throughout the start the middle and the end in an appalling way the film s use of flashback quickly gets boring while clever and interesting the first few times it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go they certainly don t increase the tension or suspense of the movie there is small thread of suspense running through the film but it certainly doesn t make this film a powerhouse thriller rather just a slightly below average one the script is lousy and contrived the characters flat and two dimensional certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential there s a good story buried in snake eyes it s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks it also gives itself away far too quickly rather than leaving the big twist for the end while the performances are intriguing especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy number cruncher wrapped up in the case there s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance and unless you re a big fan of either cage or flash directing should be avoided a david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes 
woof too bad that leap of faith was the title of a comedy starring steve martin and debra winger because that s what s required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as of all things a psychologist not since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude alas mickey rourke we hardly knew ye story opens with a campy kick willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy she goes splat he goes ugh and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind really the good doctor then moves to sunny l a where he rooms with an old college chum scott bakula a therapist who s getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group buddy bites it in the second reel no surprise there and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats for his troubles as therapy man willis gets to share some cut from nc love scenes with the lover s jane march while dodging nails cars and rattlesnakes why d it have to be snakes color of night is the worst movie of the year period forget north clifford or heaven help us even on deadly ground here is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you can t help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming for starters the group is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis these are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy playing a prissy obsessive compulsive cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif alone may set the psychology profession back ten years the plot s a wreck with laughable dialogue pointless pov shifts and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes director richard rush who once helmed freebie and the bean doesn t seem to mind unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany set pieces to make the effort almost worth watching his token freeway chase is ok but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala most recently fatal analysis acting credits are across the board awful willis can be forgiven because he s filming die hard as we speak but what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop or lesley ann warren s stereotypical sex addict or worst offender jane march as a mystery girl who s no real mystery shudder bottom line how they all kept straight faces i ll never know 
 mandingo has traditionally been seen as one of two things either a much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the words of film critic leonard maltin a trashy potboiler that appeals only to the s m crowd actually i think mandingo is a strange combination of the two although it fails on both fronts it s too trashy to be good drama but too dramatic to be good trash the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king one day in new orleans hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton although the movie never explains it a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley according to the movie mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves meanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild hammond however is happier spending nights with his bed wench the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex it is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love with his bed wench a sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is with blanche hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did of course it s fine that he s slept with numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife a white lady had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her so blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half black child although it s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth and hammond poisons blanche hammond then finds mede shoots him twice in the shoulder and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water yes you read right the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive judging only by the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in th century southern society when mandingo was released in it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs dramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically it s mostly confused if one were to judge history by this film it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality not economics not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working except for a few house servants the men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves but mandingo s overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick although there s plenty of violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure some tried to write off mandingo as a blaxploitation film one of a number of quickly made low budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies but it s not that easy mandingo was studio financed by paramount pictures and produced by dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as the bible the remake of king kong and the ill fated dune the director was richard fleischer a veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including leagues under the sea and fantastic voyage as well as such superior suspense films as the narrow margin the script based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott and the subsequent play by jack kirkland was penned by norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on serpico james mason perry king and susan george were well known and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career so why is mandingo so bad a number of reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job wexler s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combines stereotyped slave talk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whut re you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed a black brother fleischer s direction is clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nevertheless credit should be given where credit is due despite its exploitative nature mandingo was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery until then there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery even classics such as gone with the wind can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it wasn t all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets but all this is constantly undermined by the film s negligible point of view it claims to see things from the black perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners with a little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile film while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery it never deals with them the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexler s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does it steven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindler s list by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid the difference between that film and mandingo is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma mandingo is satisfied to simply show some skin and because of that its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished 
the most interesting part of can t hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of us the one part that many of us can easily relate to that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the film s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored the film wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party almost too nicely for some members of the audience read me this is basically a mirror of what s going on with them watching this film we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this after all this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with everyone s here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions of trekkies and x philes the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead s the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial lame and basically as a bunch of losers except for denise who rolls her eyes at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there unfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film the film as i said portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going a bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes we follow several of them all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and or identified with them and if we did we certainly don t want to revisit that state of being here s a quick low down it s graduation and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night otherwise known as the american grafitti or to a lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party can t hardly wait just opts for a big indoor keg party and a little bit of aimless driving albeit of the i m whining because i can t get a girl i want brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer who s been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his love for her in the hopes he ll build up the guts to give it to her even though he s leaving for a multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film and because it s a party there are some more main characters such as william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike who s humiliated him for years but gets too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom don t ask with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes films of the s most notably sixteen candles the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this film forgets to satirize its characters and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes and then says that it s all okay we can t take this film seriously nor can we take this as fun so really what good is it but i will tell you some things i did like i liked the direction except for a couple too over the top features like way too glossy jump cuts it s like an oxymoron and other obscurities generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time a thing with a note though is too hokey to really be admirable i actually did like seth green for once in about a decade when he played a very young woody allen in radio days his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film however the character of denise really doesn t work with the film when really thought about she s far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone she s not just the cynic or the intellectual she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters she may ruin the film more but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least we ll be entertained a couple other things that just don t work mike s character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me a break and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all jenna eflman s uncredited cameo as an angel just didn t work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason i m giving this such a low rating is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we d do we don t feel for these characters because for most of us we aren t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots the acid test for high school movies is does it at all capture the feel of what it s portraying the answer for this film is no nice try though 
susan granger s review of two can play that game screen gems since the success of waiting to exhale there have been several romantic comedies about african american professionals this female revenge fantasy vivica a fox plays shante smith a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success a mansion a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky hot shot lawyer morris chestnut she s at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl friends mo nique wendy racquel robinson tamala jones when your man messes up no matter how small it is she smugly decrees yuh gots to punish him so when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival gabrielle union she devises her own version of the rules a day tough love emotionally punishing plan to get him back unfortunately writer director mark brown how to be a player breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy you have to like the protagonist and shrill self congratulatory shante smith is a smirking superficial spiteful shrew who doesn t realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the day one day two title card device underscores the tedium comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut s boisterous best friend and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who s given a smooth makeover by ms robinson but the out takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself on the granger movie gauge of to two can play that game is smarmy if slick filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements coca cola miller genuine draft but little else in this r rated for explicit sexual language pseudo hip battle of the sexes the audience loses 
you d think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games it hasn t worked so far street fighter super mario brothers wing commander mortal kombat not a watchable film in the bunch still i held out some hope for tomb raider after all the game s premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept however despite the potential of the project tomb raider proves to be yet another bomb the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies there s a once ever years alignment of planets coming up and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world of course the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world our heroine lady lara croft angelina jolie finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father jon voight dug up she figures that if she gets the triangle she can bring her dad back from the dead of course no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway in both video games and action movies the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences however the action in tomb raider shows little style or originality there s lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct to cable flick the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer the mummy returns was much better it had its flaws but its action was creative and large scale since winning her academy award for girl interrupted jolie hasn t taken any projects that would display her acting talents tomb raider seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts so much attention is drawn to them that it s a shame there s no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra while we don t see much of her acting ability with the exception of a wonderful upper crust british accent we do get a hint of jolie s less savory side considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father and uninterested in any of the living males around her seems a poor choice having jolie s real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier i haven t decided what to make of director simon west yet his first feature was the star studded disaster con air but my opinion of him improved with the general s daughter which was thick with sultry atmosphere now this train wreck i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series the prisoner hollywood has already screwed up the avengers and the prisoner represents a chance for redemption by the way speaking of british tv red dwarf fans should look for chris rimmer barrie in his first major film role 
senseless r marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life alas moments are simply that moments which are not enough to lift this fantasy comedy above its one joke premise granted that one joke is initially amusing when wayans s darryl witherspoon an economics major at stratford university hits some dire financial straits he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm at this point the film sounds more like senseful than senseless but through some turns of the plot darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once essentially leaving him yes senseless this sets up some showcase moments for wayans s gift for physical comedy especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely hilariously limp but these gags and the gag behind the entire movie quickly grows stale once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses instead of exploring any new comic territory director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness wayans approaches each go round with gusto but by this point he s simply treading water for the rest of the film s unfunny duration senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn t strive to be anything more than a comic trifle however the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash strapped family and this serious angle seems to come from an entirely different movie unlike wayans s last starring vehicle the surprisingly effective and serious the th man the emotional content of senseless is forced and unconvincing any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles darryl s romance with janice tamara taylor a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself does not generate sparks of any kind once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros comes to an end the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big screen future ahead of him but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless his film career could go the way of his once promising older brother damon who is now set to make his comeback on television 
the happy bastard s quick movie review the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid really shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control sadly that is the case with kingpin a film directed by the farrelly brothers the duo that brought us there s something about mary and dumb and dumber since the duo directed and didn t write the script i can assume that s part of the problem the story seems good enough a pro bowler in the s by the name of roy munson woody harrelson is sitting on top of the world his popularity has gone through the roof and he s getting his career off the ground then however he runs into ed mccracken bill murray a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for well anything these two form an ill timed relationship that involves risky betting and before roy sees it coming ed s abandoned him and he s about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine forward seventeen years later where roy has become quite the loser complete with mechanical hand torn up car and of course the occasional knocking up of the ugly ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while however he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael randy quaid who has quite the bowling arm with the kid s help he figures he can be known again particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno nevada of course the amish kid needs some coaxing particularly when you consider well he s amish this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film such as roy s process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow finally the duo get on the road and along the way pick up an additional helper a beautiful hustler played by the gorgeous vanessa angel the main problem i had with kingpin wasn t the fact it wasn t funny in fact it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it such as the aformentioned above and roy s explanation of not having children something involving a cheese grater but that s just it scenes there s a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex boyfriend i mean was this really necessary couldn t have this been handled just a bit wackier i mean this is a comedy why throw ethics in particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle where hair gel can be easily mistaken that really ruined it however and that s too bad the acting is top notch especially from angel and murray and the really funny scenes are worth noting still if you re going to think dumb think dumb all the way through ok at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i d still be a little bit irked 
i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world and i wish that film makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how not to do it writer director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul searching in this tale of seth warner aidan quinn a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country western lyrics his pregnant wife drowns his home is destroyed by a tornado he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant seth decides to break his and sets out to turn every thou shalt not of the ten commandments into a thou shalt and vice versa his wife s sister rachel friends courteney cox wants to help seth rachel s selfish husband harry anthony lapaglia who tends to break a few commandments of his own thinks seth is a lunatic thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion taplitz isn t interested in treating seth s tragedies as genuinely tragic making it impossible to sympathize with him composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds turning seth s sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark quinn s performance as seth is all wild eyed fervor without any genuine pain the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought with one through five dispatched in a five minute montage the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high concept movie plot it s not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth s false witness only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve even she can t force taplitz to decide whose story this is or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith and the loss thereof at all seriously 
maybe this mission should have been scrubbed mission to mars a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman there s a world of difference between artists and technicians the artist has a vision to create something new he may not do it well it might be sloppy but it s something you ve never seen before a good technician can make it look good but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else it s going to be just a xerox obviously successful films need both skills brian de palma is a masterful technician he s spent his career copying others most notably hitchcock he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work but only because he has learned it by rote aside from rare flashes of originality his films are often soul dead in de palma s latest he turns his attention to stanley kubrick to tell the truth i enjoyed portions of this movie but i liked it a lot better over years ago when it was called i enjoyed it even more when it was titled close encounters nasa has set its sights for mars when the first crew meets with disaster a rescue mission is sent to the red planet they don t do so well either but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut gone rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe and it s all so boring there are so many scenes that just don t work it s difficult to begin when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside down martian tornado which looks remarkably like a sandworm from dune destroying everything in its path they just hang out watching error the most interesting character and that s not saying much is killed off error the alien is laughable error the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable error there s some nice eyecandy the face on mars which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head looks cool a three dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic but there s so much more that feels as if we ve been there before from there s the rotating space station the blinding white room from close encounters they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens the list goes on the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues even gary sinise and tim robbins can t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing no one seems to care about anything that happens you won t either the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr pepper with a foot tall logo saves the day they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film 
vampire s is a rude chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse present only to pleasure men feed vampires readied to be bashed or beaten till one s sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie to make matters worse the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks and deserve to have their heads bitten off if not their bodies carved in half the dilemma of hating the heroes as much as the villains makes one wish that the hand of god would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion james wood portrays jack crow a man obsessed with killing vampires whose soul reason for living is based on revenge they killed his parents but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires as for adam baldwin he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts action and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex as for the claims that the catholic church created dracula well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame an awful movie on all counts my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent rude vampire slayers 
arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar go to the movies fall in love move in together etc review well if you haven t seen when harry met sally or he said she said or if you don t watch love war on television you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages however if you ve seen any of these than you have seen most of this film this of course doesn t mean its bad some of it is amusing but overall i just had to ask what s the point arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love kevin pollack is the stereotypical female fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes most if which weren t very funny couteney cox is the stereotypical career minded woman who falls in love julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical this film uses a lot of formula the plot is basically known from the opening credits so what is good about the movie well as i said there are a few amusing moments surprisingly julie brown who i usually find just plain goofy was the best thing in the film also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual gee this is really short not much to say about the film really it is just kind of there watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time but i wouldn t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre 
fantastically over hyped godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands then an attack on a boat from some beast and finally we join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking about years old doing some research in chernobyl some shady u s government guys appear and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints from what looks like a giant lizard and what s more this beast is heading for new york gulp although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride and at some points it is there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie the main faults lie with the acting and writing common problems with summer blockbuster movies broderick is pretty useless as the hero with no humour or a tough guy image while emmerich s previous summer flick independence day had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith this has neither also maria pitillo as broderick s former girlfriend is just as useless with a chronic disability in acting she s incapable of showing emotion speaks every line in the same way and basically she s total crap it s up to french actor jean reno to save the day and indeed he does turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named animal and he adds a little life to the picture also making an appearance is harry shearer probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons as a slimy news reporter o k so the acting is not up to par but it never is in these movies but what about the script well that s not up to par either emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script the dialogue is banal broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters that s a lot of fish and the character development is non existent reno plays the typical frenchman no croissant broderick forever remains a geeky scientist also the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour the jokes that are uttered are pathetic and there s an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert the mayor is mayor ebert and is assistant is called gene ha ha ha ha the plot is dire and in the end just rips off jurassic park by having lots of baby godzilla s i e velicorapters running around new york right so the script and acting suck but what about the special effects thankfully they re are quite good godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi although we don t see much of him because the movie is so dark the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell but although they are impressive they can t save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie the movie goes on for far too long aswell and it can t seem to decide on a ending and of course the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel let s just hope one never arrives 
i want to be involved in show business one day and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse this movie proves it for me i was a little worried about the last batman film as i thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne they didn t kilmer did a good job and the cast was left to carry the movie which they did even jim carrey as the riddler and i can t stand jim carrey because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles this film is different the cast is still impressive but here not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction he s one of those directors who s good with actors terrible with camera angles but writer akiva goldsmith doesn t really give an impressive cast anything to do the cast is impressive clooney is a surprisingly good wayne batman o donnell is a crafty robin as usual they could ve casted somebody better as batgirl my friend likes neve campbell but silverstone is not bad and thurman is a good poison ivy the major problem is schwarzenegger who is a terrible freeze his accent is so heavy you can t understand what he says and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act and they know it but they figure that if they flex their muscles say a limited amount of stuff and kill a bunch of guys then they figure nobody ll notice that s the trouble with me i notice schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney or as much money as he got for this but hollywood thinks he does patrick stewart was the person i d heard that was considered to play freeze and he would ve been so much better or sean connery but not arnold i m not an actor but i play one in real life schwarzenegger i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film but it would ve been nice if they d casted a star that had talent for the role akiva goldsmith s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film in a regular batman film they d concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more but elle macpherson s julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is there is talk of a fifth batman movie my interest to see it is low but i hope it s better than this if you don t want to waste your time rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster any other 
 battlefield earth is the best comedy of the year it has to be the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider bad movie syndrome struck me again so after witnessing how much battlefield earth has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first hand is it as bad as advertised oh yes very much so the plot is incomprehensible the acting is atrocious the special effects are mediocre the action is dull the implausibilities are legion the dialogue is cringe inducing the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny i don t even want to continue reviewing this movie i d like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory so here it is the premise is basically a rip off of planet of the apes only minus the apes and philosophical discussion and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo the year is the psychlos have conquered earth and the human population has been enslaved only a handful of humans escaped to radiation rich areas to escape the aliens they live out their lives in fear one man johnny goodboy i know i know tyler barry pepper ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos there he confronts the psychlo head of security a big ugly klingon looking creature called terl john travolta pressed into slavery johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back meanwhile terl is faced with his own problems he has recently learned that he s stuck living on earth which he hates for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man s daughter he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology this is where the plot gets ridiculous so the man animal can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can t go terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself of course his plan doesn t work so many things wrong with this movie where to begin how about with travolta whose hollywood clout brought about this the cinematic version of scientology guru l ron hubbard s sci fi novel early previews for battlefield earth with constant shots of a makeup laden travolta cackling like lex luthor had me and several audience members remarking what the hell is travolta thinking the movie did nothing to stem such remarks all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here terl cackles after nearly every line and so does every other psychlo of course this makes every scene hilariously overwrought no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america but ceos generally don t laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees you were going to be promoted but now you re not fwahahahahahahahaha it s no big surprise terl loses to the humans he s an idiot he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book he underestimates his enemies assuming he ll win just because he s smarter he uses the word leverage like some sort of scientologist mantra not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him no wonder this guy never got his promotion the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for years and how do all these previously brain dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly there s a whole lot more to scratch one s head about in battlefield earth bring a scorecard to track the plot holes director roger christian shoots battlefield earth in the most distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason all the characters appear to be standing on the walls and it s awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue the action sequences are atrociously edited every one turned into an endless slow motion parade that drains all potential excitement are these things really so hard to construct my respect for supposed lightweight action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in battlefield earth how badly an action sequence can be shot this movie is an absolute headache it s not just the shot selection and editing the movie quite frankly makes no sense for most of battlefield earth s running time i just didn t know what was happening it didn t have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical though they certainly are i really had no idea what the hell was going on when i pieced the plot together later it didn t look any better here s how much of a disaster this is battlefield earth is already the worst movie of the year and it s going to take something really really inept to top it the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it in fact i d think that hubbard s cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible that ll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again 
alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft played character of dashing swordsman d artagnon in director peter hyam s adventure the musketeer for some reason that i may figure out later i don t know why the time money and effort were put into the making of the musketeer it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film s xin xin xiong once upon a time in china and yuen woo ping from crouching tiger hidden dragon the result is a mix of genres that don t mesh well elements of the ritz brothers style comedy for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the the three musketeers the man with no name from a fistful of dollars d artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the matrix crowd alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters the real problem with the the musketeer lies in the casting of the two lead romantically intertwined characters d artagnan and francesca mena suvari chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character a la chris o donnell but lacks any onscreen charisma suvari has the doe eyed pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen but she too does not have the chemistry to command the screen if the musketeer makes them any money they should invest in acting lessons stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one the supporting cast is on the surface impressive catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty dignity and humor especially when she plays off of d artagnan s mentor planchet jean pierre castaldi who reminds of andre the giant in the princess bride stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu but is given very little to help flesh out his character tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal s chief henchman febre he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout the rest of the players particularly the three musketeers aramis nick moran lock stock and two smoking barrels porthos steve spiers and athos jan gregor kremp are background fodder whose role is to come to d artagnan s aid when needed peter hyam s does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions d artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single handed he fights a gang of febre s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen with the obligatory branches hanging over the road he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy febre who murdered d artagnan s folks years before it is all routine stuff the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap defying gravity up walls and from horse to horse it works in a sci fi film like the matrix or in a classical fantasy like crouching tiger hidden dragon but just calls attention to itself in the musketeer at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed with a run time of minutes it should have been more like and i give it a d 
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands thank you for identifying yourselves now would you all please go away your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon it isn t just the strobe light quality of your twenty cuts per minute editing or the numbing over use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised featuring the music of no it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles welcome to the club scott kalvert your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one dimensional serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole dicaprio stars as jim carroll the new york poet songwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based as the film opens jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey mark wahlberg pedro james madio and neutron patrick mcgaw one night jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine and shortly thereafter to heroin jim s addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach bruno kirby kicked out of his home by his mother lorraine bracco and drops out of school along with mickey and pedro jim becomes a victim of the street living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll s posse resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic but now with equally unsympathetic friends as a film the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale a minute long just say no public service announcement but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie but i suppose that his pseudo sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd without a character who changes in any appreciable way the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung out cohorts all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack director scott kalvert doesn t have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work so he substitutes silly slow motion photography self consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing on only one occasion when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in are any of the gimmicks effective mostly they just draw attention to how hollow the story is they also don t allow leonardo dicaprio s performance to be as strong as it could have been for every impressive moment like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex junkie who tries to help jim straighten out but kalvert won t let character interaction define this story he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting at isolate moments the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio s talents far more frequently it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like 
remember back in the mid s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage pulp fiction and fargo both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture and not surprisingly a slew of rip offs followed in the years thereafter that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way of the gun that at first glance looks like another of those wanna be s but upon closer inspection doesn t look like anything comprehendable it s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere a film that won t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who s familiar with mcquarrie he wrote the usual suspects which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that if it s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating with the way of the gun mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea but this time the story is far less commercial a shame because maybe that would have helped the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren t hell bent on death either played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played by juliette lewis and get a nice ransom along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec his wife their hired goons and the bag man played by james caan the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he s doing the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can t call the authorities for help his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back the exec s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double crosses secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all mcquarrie doesn t know the meaning of the word simple he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie everything has to be complicated and confusing so much so that it s to the point of surrealism nothing is what it seems in this reality it s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry s rules and regulations every scene with caan s character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him getting into conversations about the business and how it works and we re hardly given a clue as to what they re talking about these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they re more like ideas ripped off from sketches found in david mamet s trash no one here really acts like a real person and the story is even further removed from reality it s like a dream without any appeal take the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff they sit on a brand new mercedes and the car alarm goes off the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don t move the guy and his loud mouth potty mouth girlfriend and about other people cross the street and gang up on them you d think phillipe and del toro are going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don t instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob there s a lot of things i didn t understand about this scene first of all the owner of the mercedes isn t some yuppie or old rich snob he s like a hippie straight out of the s secondly the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed lastly it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country s army if they were suicidal they wouldn t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place and where they get all those guns is never explained either there s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable and it s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time with any film you see whether you like it or not you can at least understand what the appeal was to it why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it i can t say either for the way of the gun because it has very little going for it and i can t imagine anyone intelligently defending it 
i m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone sure she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god s green earth second only to that movie critic at large guy but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in she always strikes out the crush was a slow moving predictable piece of fluff hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in clueless was an annoying unfunny waste of time and people have e mailed me too saying clueless is a good movie and that i m the only one who doesn t like it one girl said if i d seen the movie with an open mind i would have enjoyed it nothing could be further from the truth i went into the theater expecting to love the movie the preview looked good and of course i m crazymadinlove with alicia but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny unlikable characters almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way when we were walking out of the theater one guy and it wasn t me yelled out that was the worst f in movie i ve ever seen and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia s pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway what i got was minutes of regret the worst alicia silverstone movie ever and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like where to begin in criticizing this movie the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier the writing could have been done and for all we know it was by a ten year old alicia is the star and she s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever there is zero humor zero suspense zero drama and zero action until the last ten minutes when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero so why does this movie get one star out of me well alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub and if it wasn t bubble bath the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four star features but you settle for what you can get alicia plays a babysitter who s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home at least that movie critic at large guy does as the movie trods along we discover she s not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character s fantasies and probably every male viewer s too the drunken father thinks she s just the thing to recapture his lost youth her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she s taking her bubble bath they even throw in the middle aged wife s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this pound woman in a black silk teddy at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated in fact i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that there s absolutely no nudity in it so you can t call it a sex flick i ve already pointed out that it can t fall under drama comedy thriller or action so what do you classify the babysitter as bad 
i ll bet right now you re just lounging by the pool humming i will always love you and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success it isn t necessarily over for you i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in kevin for at least a few more years begin by scribbling the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long somewhere you ll always see it perhaps on the fridge door or on a bedroom mirror with lipstick you had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star in robin hood prince of thieves where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman and alan rickman but christian slater several dozen tall trees bows arrows and a canoe too after dances with wolves and jfk you decided the world needed more three hour movies expensive three hour movies so you starred in and produced wyatt earp wyatt earp the man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a general lack of famous wyatts wyatt earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes tombstone was a vastly superior movie based on the same legend and that featured kurt russell as earp and dana delaney as his girlfriend she was played by joanna going in your movie you know the character known best in wyatt earp as jew whore what were you and lawrence kasdan thinking now you re suffering the demise of yet another of your epics the postman a film so financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory waterworld s and tin cup s mildly lucrative box office takes the postman is not the worst movie ever made people in hollywood are quick to forget movies like howard the duck whenever the next bomb comes along yet it is a ridiculous movie i suspect you thought you had another braveheart on your hands why else line up two armies on horesback all prepared for battle for the climax of your film but mailheart the postman is not i can think of some more appropriate alternate titles post encounters of the worst kind farewell my salary howard the postman the postman s never watched twice what a brown movie i hate brown you love brown dances with wolves was golden and brown it looked like an eggo commercial the postman had me running for a glass of water every two minutes would the post apocalyptic world look this maddeningly bland and dry what exactly happened to this desert world anyway did we all become so stupid that we didn t immediately begin rebuilding homes restaurants and most importantly shopping malls after the war why did you choose to drive the movie s plot with a dumb group of terrorists who well terrorize townfolk across america why is it only they have ammunition anyway was it really appropriate to cast your daughter as a girl who has a sweet crush on you the drifter cum postman why cast english actress olivia williams as an american don t you realize that european women can only deliver their big emotional scenes in their native accent take a look at the less than stellar performances of an american ized nicole kidman or an american ized minnie driver who could give a damn whether you lived or died at the end of this movie if it came down to a fight for leadership between you and the leader of the terrorists why didn t you do that halfway through the film and save us all a lot of headaches why cast will patton as the bad guy because you worked with him in no way out sure he s a suitably creepy villain know why because he s creepy in everything including armageddon in which he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers into his space suit why heroize the most demonic institution in america the u s postal system was tom petty supposed to be playing tom petty if so why didn t he look more skeletal he should have been around years old why oh why do i have so many questions i could ask plenty more shouldn t a three hour running time have provided you enough space to answer everything you have one great line in this film and you deliver it to a mule the things i like about my ass i had to wonder actually i enjoyed the tone of the opening scenes a relaxed cynicism if you ll accept such clunky phrasing too bad you couldn t resist the temptation to film yet another love letter to your country ultimately i m saying relax there is no quota no need for you to make a picture a year settle down really question future screenplays before you commit to them feel free to write back i know how much you like letters 
synopsis a maniac crazed by virulent microphage slaughters more than twenty people including a street gang and heavily armed troops with a small knife even with a handgun however he can t take out the two cops who are after him despite having shot one of them a total of seven times comments the most notable aspect of adrenalin fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles though i admit it doesn t show in this mess henstridge just like every other actor in the film delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey the cast also includes christopher lambert who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films how on earth this movie got two big name stars to appear in it is beyond me adrenalin fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future boston has changed dramatically in those ten years it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with policia printed on their doors some guy has a really bad virus and he s killing people because of it so the brave good guys lambert and henstridge go after him that s it minutes never seemed so long this is a drawn out chase scene through dimly lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie the plot development is nil we learn absolutely nothing about lambert s character and very little about henstridge s character the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor tunnel airduct next and who will carry the flashlight a subplot does exist involving henstridge s character s illegal attempt to get her son out of boston in her opening monologue a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son twenty minutes into the film i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot in a defining scene of the movie however i changed my mind this fake passport drops to the ground lambert s cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away must not have been a good fake this emphasizes another fault with the film things just defy common sense lambert s cop for instance is shot seven times yet he is still able to talk and slide about adrenalin fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn t seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for i found myself rather bored with this film which will disappoint both sci fi horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert don t fear the rush fear the movie watch something else 
 the caliber killer has struck again starring john leguizamo mira sorvino adrian brody jennifer esposito michael rispoli bebe neuwirth rated r summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee s abilities lee is a great filmmaker often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg but here he gets himself into a bind his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work the summer of was an unusual summer in new york city it was the hottest summer on record to boot new york s first serial killer was on the loose calling himself the son of sam david berkowitz killed people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout people went berserk causing billions of dollars in damage to the city the movie s focus is on a group of twenty somethings during that fateful summer vinny john leguizamo a club hopping adultrous hairdresser his benevolent wife dionna mira sorvino looking young ritchie adrian brody a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters we follow them through their roller coaster lives thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him make him stay faithful to her ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more eccentric and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam s first murder looms the night he promises he will strike again a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects at the top of the list is ritchie vinny an unwilling part of the said group is called upon to set a trap for his friend as we watch these proceedings some of which are painfully graphic the dreaded so what question springs to mind from the way this movie is made i d have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find lee touches on so much the media the s punk scene the details of the actual killings as well as the characters very personal dilemmas but he doesn t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable too bad summer of sam doesn t get any help here frankly it s a bore a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn t entertain beyond its first half hour there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague leguizamo s turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny the script makes it clear that we re supposed to believe that his character is flawed but still a good guy you d never guess from his performance adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better sorvino gives a riveting touching performance in a banal movie i m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane her character is affecting and her emotions true to heart brody too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film it looks great it has a few notable performances and i suppose it s pretty well directed in a purely technical way but it s also empty pretentious and boring like last year s the thin red line it s a movie by a director who doesn t know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway eugene novikov 
so much for sweet returns after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative s slasher movies starting with s scream and followed by scream urban legend and the original i know what you did last summer a film like i still know what you did last summer was bound to be made sooner or late it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out and that is because they reached for the lowest common denominator in filmmaking favoring non stop deaths and gore for suspense and trading in fleshed out likable characters for one dimensional nitwits it has been exactly one year since julie james jennifer love hewitt suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road and then thinking he was dead dumped him into the ocean since then julie has relocated to boston university and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams she has been able to put her life back together when julie s friend karla brandy is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people which also includes karla s horny boyfriend tyrell mekhi phifer and will matthew settle who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend ray freddie prinze jr also returning from the original doesn t show up when they reach the secluded island they discover it is the last day of the open season and will be stranded there for the th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them of course julie her friends and the workers aren t the only ones there as the murderous ben willis dressed in fisherman garb returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like i still know what you did last summer is made i am a very big fan of horror movies and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to ikwydls which i am a fan of is almost an exact replica of a friday the th movie while the original focused more on the story and characters as well as genuinely suspenseful moments thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson who didn t return to write the sequel and it shows i still know has no story to speak of and is so vacuous of ideas that the filmmakers were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested also gone are any signs of character development and since every single character died before i got to know them all i was left with was to stare at the screen indifferent to what was going on while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died they were all paper thin and pointless except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set pieces like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar but there are none to speak of in this sequel although they do come close at one moment with brandy since so many people were killed every couple minutes the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water also of note is the mystery of the second killer and accomplice to ben but it is obvious from the first frame who it is and so i couldn t even have fun at that like i did in the scream movies and urban legend it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else maybe the people who made i still know what you did last summer should have realized that in order to make a good movie you must have a screenplay or at least one that isn t such a black hole for thoughts and ideas the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead 
based on the s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie be happy i won t bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box office after scoring huge successes with men in black directed by the same man who controlled this one and independence day can you say the third times not a charm plot james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation s top scientists and threatening to take over the united states within a week critique i did not laugh once during this entire picture when you consider that this film is a part comedy that s not a very good sign i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes when you consider that the other part of this film is geared as an action adventure i would say that this another negative sign and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow the story line tired reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one liners weak characterizations and an anti climactic end you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this big summer blockbuster it blows or as they say in french eet blows could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it maybe could it be that most of the special effects don t show up until the last half hour and even then we don t see anything that its trailers hadn t already given away perhaps or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big budget movies that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own naaaaaaah a bad movie is a bad movie on a positive note i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek who seemed underused in my humble opinion and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in branagh was also fun as the scenery munching over the top bad guy but that s pretty much where the entertainment buck stopped smith and kline were static at best the plot full of holes and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie then again there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage huh oh yeah but the rest of the movie sucked little known facts about this film and its stars will smith has starred in two of the ten all time top grossing films worldwide s summer blockbuster men in black for which he also recorded the grammy winning title song and s independence day he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama and has been married to the cute as a button actress phoebe cates since they have two kids together greta simone and owen one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has kasdan written on it lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies including the big chill silverado i love you to death grand canyon and french kiss salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over even though she spoke no english she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders mi vida loca no not the rickie martin video and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez s desperado opposite antonio banderas since then she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez s films she stands was born in southeast mexico and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother one of the actresses cast as branagh s lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner another is dutch born frederique van der wal who is one of the world s most recognized supermodels having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times as well as harper s bazaar vogue and mademoiselle 
in my review of the spy who shagged me i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series it is followed by a third movie that is a bore the cause is probably complacency a studio sighs with relief when part lives up to expectations and figures part is a sure thing scream provides the latest proof of this rule in los angeles production has begun on stab return to woodsboro the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott neve campbell however life soon starts imitating art and stab cast members turn up stabbed smelling yet another book deal gale weathers courteney cox arquette comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex boyfriend dewey riley david arquette acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer parker posey the actress playing gale in stab elsewhere our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice the late randy meeks jamie kennedy makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with indeed scream tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all the murder of sidney s mother maureen before the beginning of the original scream at the scene of each murder in scream the killer leaves a photo of sidney s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer to find out who the killer is our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen s missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low budget horror films even with that little information you can probably already guess what the killer s relationship to sidney is unlike its predecessors scream doesn t have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped so that by the end we don t even care who the killer is the jaded detective patrick dempsey the kinky producer lance henriksen the driven young director scott foley the ingenue emily mortimer the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret so it s quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen the series trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious possibly it s the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson who penned the first two or maybe it s that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first scream was repeated moment for moment in the hollywood set of her home at some point referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas scream also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles look for jenny mccarthy carrie fisher patrick warburton puddy from seinfeld roger corman and jason mewes and kevin smith as jay and silent bob to walk through at some point all these bit players put forth more effort than the series returning stars who are probably saving their energy for the long post scream job search another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass more movies are copying the blair witch project s web strategy scream has three official websites that wink wink pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie the sunrise studios site scream com has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the latest stab news there s also a gail weathers official site galeweathers com and a sunrise sucks site that has more stab scandals the studio wants to cover up sunrisesucks com craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the scream series while i hope that s true i don t hold out much hope horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters there s a halloween h k in the works even though michael myers was beheaded in h and a freddy vs jason has been talked about for awhile despite the fact that both characters were killed off there s bound to be a scream someday even if it starts over with a new set of movie star wannabes bottom line they should have called this one yawn 
i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films when done right with at least slightly evident restraint they can be engaging sweeping appealing but it s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle a hollow boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers the ones willing to buy into ephron s whiny views of life and romance tom hanks and meg ryan two of hollywood s most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed repectively baldwin s wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son jonah seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out ephron has him do this so that annie reed meg ryan can hear it annie is a happy woman she is engaged to walter an allergy prone working man and seems to be perfectly content but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it five years after this movie hit theaters hanks ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better although still sub par romantic comedy you ve got mail which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o donnell but none of them can save the film from being a bore its characters are dull and empty its script isn t funny or particularly charming the script has a fundamental problem annie gives up for little reason her life with walter to pursue sleepless in seattle whom she has never even seen it s the kind of life decision that real people don t make and its a major unforgivable plausibility sacrifice in essence this movie s purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn t even exist it s a ten minute short film with ninety five minutes of filler if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn t have to review it you could just call me asleep in philadelphia eugene novikov

i looked at the internet movie database s awards section for this film and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for best picture drama anyone who s seen this film can back me up on this this is the worst of the great disaster films and that s not really saying a lot for this film earthquake is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured on video it s a bland and slow moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters the disaster film requisite then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster while this worked in say the towering inferno it doesn t here for one single reason we don t care about any of the characters the film gives us charlton heston in one of many crap s films he made including skyjacked and that classic soylent green as a rich man married to ava gardner who is having a little affair with a young single mom genieveve bujold a renegade police officer on suspension george kennedy in his least humored performance in the second weirdest subplot a motorcycle stuntman richard roundtree right after his shaft thing whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down yea snore and the weirdest subplot a military man bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair in smaller subplots there s a pointless bit about people who are flying over l a the city in the film by the way one who s playing cards and married to a boring non acting husband you think this one can go nowhere guess again he gets interested in the final frames there s genieveve bujold s moron son who has a little adventure with wires and for some much needed comedy there s walter matthau billed as walter mutha the only laugh in the film as a wild drunkard who s big moment is a dance he does at a critical time as for the actual earthquake it s rather a let down there s a full hour of character setups none of which is interesting then about minutes of shaking crumbling and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold narrowly missing this film needed that whole theatre shaking they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored there s little suspense following the quake although this film tries for it there s an adventure in a crumbling high rise office building the wires with the kid and the movement of people who are all injured but none of these are all too suspenseful the finale with the heston gardner bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip of the coin bit which brings out a big let down and there s no real finale even volcano ended nicely and that movie really sucked not only is it hokey but you don t care about any character who cares if heston dies who cares if he choses bujold or gardner although i would have chosen gardner mainly on the basis that she can actually act who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid stunt who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires and who cares about that whole plane spiel if anything earthquake is worth a viewing for the same reason glen or glenda is i mean i laughed at this more than i did at bio dome but that s another story and review in short earthquake gives disaster pics a bad name 
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible director john woo the killer hard boiled face off appears to have made an exciting elegant charming spy thriller kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american read unsophisticated hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them sadly as the picture progresses the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up two hour long episode of magyuver and not a particularly good one at that what went wrong mi begins flashily enough that initial flash leading us to believe that it ll soon give way to something of a plot but it only gives way to more flash then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise s firing gun just so they can die really cool early on during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt tom cruise and nyah nordoff hall thandie newton woo works some of his trademark magic in one hypnotic though completely inexplicable sequence the director slows the action down to a languid semi stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other s eyes with come hither sexuality just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain sans scaffolding then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another why i haven t the foggiest i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply with mi woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects it s possible that these spies could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off though of course this is never explored the scenes i ve described are really only included to titillate not to give any insight into character god forbid woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial like visuals still in terms of crackerjack eye candy the opening has much to cherish cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is between the frantic dancing woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa kind of way yet it has style and something of soul and woo casts a bit of a spell on us sure it s all smoke and mirrors but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres newton bats her eyes flirtatiously cruise grins a little too slyly the cruise character ethan hunt has been drastically altered since the first film here cruise plays him more as a hip sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part he s cool and dashing which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film and blustered his way through magnolia quite possibly the most overrated performance of the s sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise s initial i m the man charm and more slo mo close ups of his preening mug mi falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won t stop the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle the first gun fight in the film which really should be unheard of in a john woo film but alas this particular battle could ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi of course excepting the symbolic pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture we ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand it isn t done any differently here the action is pure hard target broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind he s cool for sure but he s made to be as empty as the movie the actor isn t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment be it during a gunfight before one or after one when he s not beaming away he s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell but woo s editing seriously undermines the effort he fetishizes cruise s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he s really austin powers in a classic woo action moment ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin up boy angel of death the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does the lead bad guy played by the appropriately british dougray scott and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken on motorcycles though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug only to fly about a hundred feet still in bear hug position land on a beach below and begin a mano e mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a so you thought i was dead not to worry cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat what a hero you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi s plot my reasoning is simple i m not sure of any good it would do the film itself has absolutely no concern with story only with hurtling forth to the next special effect i wasn t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi has less plot than the average aerosmith video nobody will go to this for the plot and if they do they ll surely regret it as summer movies evolve or devolve character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing in mi the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma s that film s director stylistic flourishes while in mi the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo s non stop masturbatory pandemonium it s irrelevant in every sense as is character all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors 
my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one but in fact the third installment it was the first to gain a national theatrical release i didn t see the first film until much later so looking back the original didn t hold a lot of great memories for me since i didn t think too much of it when i initially saw it watching it now for a second time confirmed that it s an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever you all know the story by now child murderer freddy krueger robert englund returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before this first installment does an adequate job with it s low budget but there s some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story plus the movie s ending understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a hook for a sequel renders the rest of the film pointless and does anyone understand what happens to nancy s mother at the end of this film don t get me wrong though it s not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly and a nightmare on elm street just doesn t cut it a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set the film is presented in both pan and scan and it s original theatrical aspect ratio of although on the disc that comes in the box set only a widescreen transfer is provided the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio a mono mix and a new dolby digital mix also included on the dvd is a full length audio commentary track with writer director wes craven stars john saxon and heather langenkamp and the film s director of photography other extras include the jump to a nightmare feature i m sure you can figure that one out the usual cast and crew bios which are from the film s original press release kit and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp and the film s original theatrical trailer some dvd rom features are also included but since i don t have dvd rom capabilities i can t really get into that the commentary track is entertaining and informative but nothing spectacular the first thing of note is that it s the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago i m not saying that s a negative thing just pointing it out everyone seems enthusiastic about being there with the possible exception of john saxon who just doesn t say much at all most of the time you ll forget he s even there everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason as if because they re commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film however you can only access one easily the other is hidden in what s called the labyrinth which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created basically it s an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage interviews etc somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film finding it though is both a chore and a bore r 
its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated yet trys a bit too hard with the voices of woody allen gene hackman jennifer lopez sylvester stallone and sharon stone this computer animated yak fest think toy story filled with used merchandising is one for the ant eaters the main story is the independence of a worker named z allen he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony when he finds out about insectopia a mythical place where all insects can run free z along with his colony s princess stone journey out into the world to find a meaning for life about minutes into the picture i began to wonder what the point of the film was halfway through i still didn t have an answer by the end credits i just gave up and ran out antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice overs allen is nonchalant while i would have guessed if i hadn t seen her in the mighty and basic instinct stone can t act even in a cartoon this film is one for the bugs unfunny and extremely dull hey a bug s life may have a good time doing antz in 
 years ago national lampoon introduced us to a new family the griswolds in the griswolds embarked on a cross country journey with the destination of wally world a world renowned theme park in california we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured two years later we watched again as they went to europe and four years after that we shared christmas with them now eight more years have passed and the laughs have done more than die they ve been cremated vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold the good intentioned but ill fated father of two the premise is basically the same clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation this time to las vegas his wife ellen beverly d angelo and teenage kids rusty and audrey always played by different actors this time around by ethan embry and marisol nichols respectively join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick of course a vacation movie wouldn t be complete without good ole eddie reprised by randy quaid the misfit cousin showing up at all the wrong times there isn t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it it s really just a skit movie there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie which is not a real term as far as i know the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours therefore coming off like a two hour skit the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits each lasting about five minutes vegas vacation comes off like the first a good example of the latter would be last year s black sheep the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast and it doesn t really fit into a movie mold in these cases a plot which is generally very thin is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags i e have a good vegas joke make a vegas movie such is the case with this movie s mini plots clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold s money ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie shae d lyn as an exotic dancer the simple fact is this movie isn t funny at first i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes but when the movie got rolling my interest suddenly stopped chase plays clark griswold really well he made the character and he is the character d angelo to be quite honest never was too impressive as ellen and this movie doesn t show any signs of redemption as for the two new griswold kids the word blah comes to mind the vacation series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters the simple reason being that there is nothing to them they re so generic you ll expect the credits to read girl as audrey griswold vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor yes it s true that vegas vacation isn t even close to being close to being as funny as the others which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart first off why did they leave off the national lampoon s heading on the title i couldn t find any reasons why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn t want to be associated with such a lame film that s saying a lot especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon pcu etc if they expected this to be another hit you would assume they d be proud to tack on the notorious header but for reasons only we can guess at like the movie sucking they didn t there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact the first three films in the vacation series were written by john hughes a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the s including mr mom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris bueller s day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck wowzers what a r sum looking at the names you d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the s well that s not all this guy also brought us s hits including the home alone series the remake of dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber vegas vacation however didn t have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious this time around the script is in the hands of elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four made for tv movies vegas vacation plays very much like one and it would actually work much better as a made for tv sequel if this sounds like a wild idea it s not revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like it vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a a m sunday morning movie but as a silver screen major motion picture it s quite out of place stephen kessler s jejune direction doesn t help things either he only makes the film even more tv movie ish each consecutive vacation movie has suffered a drop in directing power we started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co writing ghostbusters not too bad then we had national lampoon s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling who would go on to direct the hits look who s talking and clueless as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high lastly we had national lampoon s christmas vacation directed by jeremiah s chechik who went on to direct the charming benny joon kessler so far has one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received an oscar nomination in granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get a movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal if you loved the vacation movies and i know some of us did there still isn t anything here worth seeing if you loved them don t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte if you never did like the series why the need to confirm why 
capsule one of the ten worst movies ever made christopher lambert vs evil ninjas in modern day japan and nobody wins the hunted is such a bad movie so completely inept and so totally brain damaged that i could almost feel affection for it i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it if it weren t also insanely xenophobic and insulting christopher lambert plays a computer parts salesman who s on business in japan he meets a slinky young woman joan chen and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader john lone apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered since lambert is a witness he s of course the next one to die let s stop and think about this for a second if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society he d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock in this movie the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body you know what a goof field is that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is this is of course only the beginning of the movie s problems lambert eventually finds pseudo safety with a long haired modern day samurai yoshio harada and his partner yoko shimada who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun they are the two best things in the movie in every scene they have authority and presence and they actually look like they belong here even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows the script doesn t know what the hell to do with them lone as the bad guy is zero dimensional the only bad guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him in the hunted this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype what s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes there s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver and a girl in a pachinko parlor but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful also the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack get the cd that manages to survive despite the drek it s been designed to accompany there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing a gory excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re couple the whole thing with the movie s relentlessly stupid plot by the time we get to the final showdown with lambert getting to wield his own sword which judging from the ham handed editing of one scene was forged in seven hours or so we no longer care we re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies someone once said that the key to good art good movies good books whatever is to start somewhere interesting end up somewhere interesting and show respect for the audience all along the way this movie bungles two out of three badly

for original sin the road to the screen has been rocky initially slated for release last november the film was bumped twice finally landing in the dog days of summer advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands so is original sin really all that bad yes it is but the melodrama does offer some rewards the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t a with angelina jolie providing the t and antonio banderas the a more importantly the movie is entertainingly bad veteran readers know that as a rule i don t encourage people to patronize lousy films most of the time there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides the let s go laugh at the failings of others mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable but things are different this summer quality films to put it mildly have been few and far between so as far as i m concerned it s fair to find our kicks where we may original sin will never join such treasures as valley of the dolls road house and showgirls in the bad movie hall of fame but it ll do until something worse comes along the film adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel waltz into darkness which was also the source for the francois truffaut film mississippi mermaid opens in a turn of the century prison as jolie s character slated for a dawn execution tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like this is not a love story it is a story about love wary of local gold diggers cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas banderas makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold diggers a practical man luis chooses a frumpy looking lady hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children imagine his surprise when his fianc e julia russell jolie turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo julia explains that she sent a different woman s image because she didn t want to be selected solely for her pretty face luis then confesses his deception leading julie to state with great significance we have something in common we are both not to trusted after their wedding luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun although the filmmakers insistence on using one of banderas legs to cover jolie s crotch makes it look like he s trying to climb her luis the stupidest man who ever lived immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up luis must force julia to write to her sister emily who is frantic over her lack of communication shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck finally when she cleans out his accounts and disappears luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong incidentally if you re afraid i m giving too much away rest assured that all of this happens in the first minutes of the movie leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass along the way private detective walter downs played by thomas jane who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie turns up hired by the frumpy woman s sister to find out what happened to the real julia luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist having decided that if he can t have her he will kill her oh the pathos of it all the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story adjusting their performances accordingly banderas is suitably impassioned while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting and with those lips she can really pout as for thomas jane he starts off acting suspicious and cagey then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness his most startling moment comes when to prove his power to humiliate he forces luis against a wall verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full on kiss if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape show them this chilling scene and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler show them original sin 
are you like me do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places shouting out loud not giving a ratt s ass about anyone around them and basically just wallowing in their own self importance well if you are than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half only to make up and hug in the end aaaaaaaahhhh plot three grown up sisters living their own separate lives begin to re establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill critique this would be a good movie if it wasn t for the fact that it s got very little to say features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third rate after school special and i m being nice how junk like this gets made is beyond me but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan s character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot wow how deep of course the same christmas tune that s played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background while characters continue to build bonds among one another by making reference to old quaint movies or movie stars stop me i m gonna cry again this film is a mess the characters are boring and irritating to watch the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot kind of liking their father but not really and then finally realizing the error of their ways while sharing an emotional moment about movie stars from the s admittedly i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot looking as adorable as ever but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie tv show that she s in enough already and diane keaton must ve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one cause her acting was amateurish at best neither one convinced in emotional scenes granted they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that s probably where my rating of three points comes from all in all this movie is not funny unless you re one to chuckle at train wrecks provides zero drama unless you consider loud phone conversations moving generates absolutely no emotion although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine and ends on a perfectly pretentious note oh no please don t get any flour on my donna karan dress ugh i suggest that all ladies take their husbands boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something that ll teach em to mess with you oh and incidentally mrs joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind so there then again maybe you ll like it 
actually i m fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie baywatch babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double d s on the small screen at least there you don t have to pay to see her cleavage and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless hate to burst your bubble but there are no full fledged nude scenes in barb wire you wouldn t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in i can t go back in time and reverse my mistake but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude it s so quick you can t even tell for sure whether you re seeing her andersons or not a nipple hallucination sort of thing barb wire was adapted from a comic book interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life even wearing low cut leather to do office work businesswoman bondage wear and having unreal body proportions yes like the mona lisa pamela anderson is a man made beauty probably in more senses than one she is a definite beauty though and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience you d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie because it s obvious she wasn t pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills i mean she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler s convention the movie is set in the year the worst year of my life pam says the worst movie of the year i say america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation silicone valley i think she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute but don t call her babe she hates that and reminds us of that fact way too many times imagine a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist demeaning term a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn t have to hear words like babe during a strip tease especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success the plot ha ha revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate s retina scanners in the words of one of the characters they re more than meets the eye reminds me of the transformers cartoon and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent but that never happened no the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van damme big busted kickboxer and her resistance accomplices ex boyfriend axel tamuera morrison and cora victoria rowell thank god they didn t name her cora reef one bad character name is more than enough pamela originally doesn t take sides giving some speech about she s only loyal to the money they pay her but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother jack noseworthy of bon jovi always video fame i still don t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy but he definitely is nose worthy even if he isn t sponge worthy pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest it s not rambo it s bimbo mark my words barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year it s got all the elements of the direct to video releases featured on hbo s bastard cousin the cable channel i d never watch if it didn t somehow come free it s got the non titillating scenes of voyeurism laughable flashbacks bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo there s even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie s premise while the words scroll up the screen someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain t star wars if you ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years you ll recognize plenty of lifted elements barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over car crashes explosions broken glass and slow motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death this is one of those automatic pilot movies anyone could write or direct barb wire has only two things going for it and i think you know what those two things are 
the crown jewel of s irwin allen disaster movies the poseidon adventure features an all star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship the story begins on the u s s poseidon s big new year s cruise where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive let s see there s the new age preacher hackman who advises people to pray to that part of god within yourself there s the ex cop borgnine who busted a hooker stella stevens six times then married her there s the hippie singer there s got to be a morning after who turns to the company of a lonely man red buttons once her brother is killed and to round out the group the elderly couple jack albertson and shelley winters who live aboard the ship the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship everyone s in the giant ballroom at the time shortly past midnight of the new year when the ship turns first on its side then completely upside down the second in command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship in this case because the ship is overturned the top is the bottom or is the bottom the top either way we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and in the ballroom scene christmas trees thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors through burning rooms etc while the ship slowly fills with water behind them it s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at with all the melodrama that comes in between the non thrilling action scenes the one note in borgnine s one note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love although since there isn t a sex scene we never find out if his buttons really are red and albertson and winters wonder if they ll live to see their grandson s birth shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along winters who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie stevens even not so affectionately calls her fatass in one scene finally finds her purpose i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen she brags and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years she s swimming through the water her skirt billowing up around her hips showing off her cellulite or do you call it shellulite ridden thighs it s not so much funny as innately disgusting which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole 
here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy bait starring jamie foxx and david morse this is a review i don t even want to write because i d just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other so generic and predictable it s beyond ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff if they re not going to give us the audience just a little credit and put something together with half a brain why should i waste my time and mental energy criticising it last summer i took this same approach with my review of the mummy in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub par movies i think i shall do the same thing here but with a few less quotes not all are applicable i hope this goes to show you what i think of bait and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take a wild guess it s genuinely unfunny i and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours unoriginal and unthrilling it s not so bad to the point where it s fun to watch because of its badness and it s no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it it s just such a cliche in and of itself that uhh lost my train of thought anyways here s those quotes enjoy getting an audience s attention right from the beginning plays a major role in how today s films work we want to have something exciting to watch not a slow build up of a story god forbid and this film plays right into the mainstream s hands review of armageddon it s clear the film doesn t want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability the most minimal amount necessary comes across as a half assed effort supporting characters and shady sup plots are introduced but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of characters only a handful have any real significance there s a fine line separating homage from plagiarism review of godzilla unfortunately as is the case with most modern thrillers once the film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence the cliches and action sequences take over review of the jackal chad z movie page is back after heavy renovation reviews of nearly all mainstream movies playing today get my reviews of everything playing at your local cineplex so you can better make an informed decision on what to see don t forget to vote on my poll and sign the guestbook 
 s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood two movies dealing with the same subject or to be precise same high concept in summer that high concept was mad bomber action thriller in few weeks thrillride of the summer actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland where gaerity tommy lee jones ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material escapes from prison he comes to boston where he accidentally notices jimmy dove jeff bridges dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police few people except gaerity know the dove s violent past when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror directed specifically at dove s colleagues friends and relatives dove who is just going to retire and start family now must confront the mad bomber while speed doesn t even try to bother with plot and characters using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all screenplay by john bateer and john rice barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama the plot is of course full of implausibilities the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual no matter how brilliant he is can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay those questions same as in the case of speed could be forgotten while the action goes on but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters because of them movie seems a little bit too long and boring at times the most annoying element of the film however is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber his acting is so over the top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive the film have few bright points though some of the action scenes are fine which should be credited to director stephen hopkins predator ii judgement night and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove s colleague but all in all blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous yet hardly unforgettable competitor 
 spawn may be somewhat of an older film in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn t seen it will finally get to see it that is if they see it but i managed to catch it before it made it s way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing it wasn t the worst film of year by any means it isn t even on the top of the worst films of the year but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten which in simpler terms means it comes in at number on my worst of list the only reason it doesn t come in lower is thanks to the special effects which might actually have been some of the best of the year performances however were either wooden or for the most part unforgivingly campy in fact this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality i don t know how to explain that one it wasn t exactly choppy but something about it seemed well annoyingly unprofessional john leguizamo almost makes it as clown but not quite he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional but the main problem i found with spawn as with most films that wind up on my worst of lists is that it was just plain boring i wouldn t even say there was a climax to the film sure it had the big battle scene at the end but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion never too soon the movie did conclude in a very simple disappointing way even though it s one of the shorter movies i ve seen this year it s one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again like i said the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride no matter how small i was impressed with the opening sequence so long as i didn t allow the melodramatic voice over and lobotomizing editing to get to me and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn s outfit created but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes which looked quite a bit like a modern video game who knows if spawn the video game wasn t part of the plan from the beginning keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable and in a very small amount makes up for the cheeziness of it all but none of this movie s saving graces can it make it something i d recommend seeing no matter what the price of admission this movie is definitely not for young children which shouldn t really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers if anyone would likely find it appealing if you really want to catch a movie there are many better ones out there no matter what your tastes might be trust me spawn has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers 
the yet to be released krippendorf s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy but buyer beware this movie can t make up its mind is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies menstruation circumcision and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort either way unbalanced is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort the premise is catchy widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf richard dreyfuss has spent the past two years getting over the death of his wife neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses now it s time to show what he s achieved in those two years and he has absolutely nothing to show for it with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous grant was spent on trips to mcdonald s but when his discovery becomes the latest craze among colleagues the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe he must create it with the aid of his three children the headstrong teen shelly natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you the slightly younger mickey gregory smith and the nine year old edmund carl michael lindner the shelmikedmu tribe named from the first half of each child s name is born and videos quickly produced in krippendorf s backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe despite the professor s wishes the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows due in greatest part to veronica micelli jenna elfman an overly vivacious and voluptuous anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf s main assistant hungry for recognition micelli sets up interviews lectures etc in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history a sure fire way to go down in the history books krippendorf on the other hand is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor not in history books and with each new lecture he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe mating habits domestic structure etc thru fumbling improvisation and often some quick thinking from his oldest son krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe on the opposing end is krippendorf s arch rival ruth allen lily tomlin an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non existent tribe it s a cute idea and approached with a more subtle and mature style krippendorf s tribe could ve been a real winner sadly the mostly misfired toilet humor overly comical musical score by bruce broughton and sugar coated sentiments all the key ingredients of a family comedy just aren t the right tone for this film cut that crap out add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you ve got a good start at the state it s in now you ve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs doubtfire meets dumb dumber and that s not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of average with a few laugh out loud moments and a great big gap in between them most of the characters are surprisingly two dimensional and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort lyonne seems to go greatly unappreciated director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways it s stuck in limbo between disney family fare jungle jungle and potentially hilarious adult comedy a fish called wanda it s this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade and it s a brutal drop a strong warning to parents forget the impression given by advertisements do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she s holding his penis yes it s put that bluntly just be warned this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film and others might not be as tame 
the working title for no looking back was long time nothing new and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny minutes it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics writer director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn t spent their life in seclusion instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide and the sooner the better alas that s not the case and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio and to further depress audiences burns has shot the entire film on cold rainy days in a gray new york state beach town peeks of sunshine are few and far between no wonder the characters are all so miserable first of all we have charlie burns a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home that girlfriend is claudia lauren holly and after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie s departure she has moved on shacking up with one of charlie s old school buddies mike jon bon jovi the two have a comfortable relationship but it s apparent to even a blind person that they re not right for each other claudia years for some spice in her life mike wants to settle down and have children then charlie re enters the mix so who if anyone will claudia end up with who cares no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we re not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle so what if no one finds happiness these characters don t deserve it anyway especially after wasting minutes of our time they aren t real people they re a writer s construct stumbling through a too obvious storyline they should know the ending as well as we do and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially interesting supporting characters blythe danner is solid as claudia s housebound mother connie britton is suitably high strung as claudia s neurotic sister and jennifer esposito is eye catching as a bartender in search of a little romance sadly all we get is quick glimpses into their lives although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career but he could still use a little polish the worst case is lauren holly who presents a completely bland claudia as portrayed here she s hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment s interest not to mention undying love burns ex the monumentally untalented maxine bahns would have been hard pressed to do a less inspired job when he released the brothers mcmullen edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the sundance film festival robert redford has apparently stuck with him the aging actor director executive produced this mess two films and three short years later the luster has faded some movie makers have only one good film in them with back to back duds like she s the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club

there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling hapless straight man from the hysterical naked gun films crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he s committed himself to starring in since the wavering movie spoofs however are less forgivable to be fair wrongfully accused the send up in question and nielsen s third parody since the last gun isn t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his dracula dead and loving it or spy hard which is a mighty good thing nielsen is still in tip top comedic form able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them and he needs one very soon wrongfully accused meshes together the premises of the fugitive and patriot games casting its always game star as ryan harrison get it a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress kelly le brock she however sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband michael york a crime actually committed by a one armed one legged one eyed man aaron pearl harrison is arrested found guilty and sentenced to death but escapes from a prison bus of course and then is pursued by a determined u s marshal named fergus falls richard crenna unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones already smirky oscar winning role there s also a mystery brunette melinda mcgraw and an assassination subplot involving the u n secretary general but like any of it matters wrongfully accused gets off to an assured start with an in concert nielsen touted lord of the violin by bare chested posters pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo clad mosh in front of the stage nice touch most of the scenes that follow however never top the opener hysterical exceptions the mentos and baywatch goofs movie parodies are crammed in at an almost subliminal rate but most are empty when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la anaconda or baseball players disappear into a field of dreams esque cornfield there s really nothing to laugh at other moments like an interlude in a fishing shop are so unfocused that you re not sure what you re supposed to be laughing at there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send ups here so it s possible that director writer pat proft by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two guarantees something is sure to stick and what does stick sticks well particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard boiled dialogue what those naked gun s which proft collaborated on did great these bits are so on target that they allow you to remember wrongfully accused as an almost halfway there spoof instead of a lame brained failure the movie might have been cursed to begin with opening fast on the heels of mafia from proft colleague jim abrahams and baseketball from proft colleague david zucker but it s a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing wrongfully accused of being nielsen s funniest 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned quick robin the anti shark repellant adam west in the batman feature film casually kicking at a pathetic looking rubber shark attached to his leg i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard this is a disasterously bad film easily the worst in the series to date and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive it s loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman with chris o donnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemically induced villains the nefarious ice cold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss by ivy s side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson a grunting hulk of a beast the villains goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivy s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit by destroying all human life meanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone akiva goldsman s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad with astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful by the number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement it makes goldsman s screenplay of batman forever which i thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i d seen used in no joke an episode of gilligan s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production joel schumacher s direction of batman and robin is horrific with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case i suppose if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy s chosen new abode another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons mr schumacher s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible to the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all out camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film s opening even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered is batman and robin supposed to be campy i think it is it s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be i somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn t attempting to be the utter farce which it is arnold schwarzenegger is top billed in the film as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be mr schwarzenegger s attempts to be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable by the end of the film i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near unintelligble puns and one liners featuring every possible permutation of cool in the least inventive way george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin being overshadowed by the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film his batman is hardly an imposing figure chris o donnell is unimpressive in a one note performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all the film s one saving grace undoubtably uma thurman s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy her work in batman and robin is certainly over the top but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film ms thurman s comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully i m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey s performance in batman forever her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film and when she s offscreen the film greatly suffers i figure that if one has to die being kissed to death by uma thurman isn t a half bad way to go while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse pounding excitement i must admit that i was not bored watching it although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one liner and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat it s been a long time since i ve laughed so much at a movie at of course is the operative word 
my inner flag was at half mast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet reruns off the air sure i d seen them all at least once but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb anti fans still have the d i a s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous blue boy episode of dragnet for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb s rapid fire speeches and straight faced seriousness think of the d i as what would happen if sgt joe friday ever enlisted because he plays exactly the same character here a no nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded melodramatic speeches on any topic in this election year i m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb s office door and enters he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up the produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much goes without saying this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason i was wondering if there would even be a plot i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants but the d i gives us more much more webb s mission is to make a man out of private owens the local screw up the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself whether the lace panties part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered this of course gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life a living hell for those of you who haven t been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching here s a reprint of a typical monologue of his i can t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the words should at least partially convey what i m talking about now you listen to me youngster someday you ll wake up fighting on a beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn t get killed because of your foolishness i ve got a headline for you every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours you re gonna turn around and i ll be standing right there i couldn t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d i nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day s work by going to the local bar where he orders a tomato juice he meets a woman who coincidentally also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch rival another marine d i webb marches over to the table gets up in her face and says just what kind of a dame do you think you are bogart he ain t the other d i gets one of the few memorable non webb lines when he confesses to the girl he s a damn good d i i guess i m just a little jealous join the club we re all jealous of jack webb s way with women which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene as webb finds his way to the woman s place of employment a lingerie store and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display you expect me to talk to you in here he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras the woman goes off to help a customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen a little girl spots him in the store and demands what are you doing in here you re a man aren t you he doesn t reply but you know he s thinking in his head what an odd species of human so small must be one of those children everyone s been talking about this poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversions he s responsible for the movie doesn t focus too closely on webb s romance it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owens was that flea you killed a male or female owens replies a male sir webb yells to the platoon this ain t the one that such a scene along with the rest of the movie was intended to be taken seriously defies comment but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d i but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the th century webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie with the exception of owens were played by actual marines someone wanting to parody this movie couldn t do a more comical job than webb did it makes it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself there s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter webb bursts in the room and shouts what did i tell you about laughing to which the private replies sir only nine year old girls laugh sir and let me tell you i was as happy as a nine year old girl while watching this movie 
numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci fi suspense thrillers soldier is a multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground besides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done with better choreography russell who is usually a good actor in b grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character sergeant todd who seems more like a sergeant toad besides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombie like which is in line with his screen persona but scores little points of empathy with the audience this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former it is still a long way from anything considered desirable 
capsule a wild jungle woman and an story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc this is a laughable rip off of king kong itself a rip off production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter high to directed by ho meng hua this film is provided to be a sort of laughing stock to finish the festival an earthquake uncovers an story tall gorilla in the himalayas a hunter chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible nice miniature effects however has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi chi the leopard several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim actual location shooting in mysore ape shown badly matted behind temple combining of images usually pretty bad incompetent matching of film stocks stock footage frequently used gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good 
i have a great idea for a movie one that can t miss see i ve got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances it s about professional basketball so i ll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity as for what the movie is actually about well that will all sort itself out eventually i figure it will be a comedy so i ll throw a half dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with maybe we ll put a gender spin on it see if we can get some women out to see it too eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind twister as inane as the script might have been at least required some creative technicians mission impossible overwrought plot and all at least involved genuine effort eddie just sits there hawking up a formula story without any laughs and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin a new york limo driver and die hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team coach john bailey dennis farina has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas and the losses are beginning to mount the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess frank langella to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team the winner surprise surprise is eddie who becomes a fan favorite and eventually the actual coach the knicks continue to lose but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops incidentally the knicks eventually start winning please raise your hand if that comes as a shock and i will invite you to my all night marathon of the bad news bears major league angels in the outfield the mighty ducks the big green cool runnings and little giants awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds it s what they do those teams usually involve kids for a very sound comedic reason it s funnier when they screw up and they re more sympathetic those which don t involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles for another very sound comedic reason they generally have developed some sort of comic timing eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it s easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players this finds nba players like greg ostertag dwayne schintzius rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players perhaps that all didn t matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming don t blame me i just work here perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn t a movie it s a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump new york mayor rudolph giulianni former new york mayor ed koch david letterman letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas and those are the real jokes in eddie nothing these individuals say or do is funny you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice hey it s donald trump or hey it s mujibur and sirajul it s difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can t even get the cliches in a cliche ridden genre script right the knicks coach who is eddie s antagonist early in the film reappears at the end but he isn t given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs neither is frank langella and none of the athlete actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of that leaves her to do her street wise miss thang routine but with no character no sharp lines and no help eddie isn t just a bad movie with a formulaic premise it s a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy 
the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending watching one of these movies everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise when the film ends there is a moment of confusion then recollection then some more confusion then possibly a second viewing for clarification this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more good surprises make movies fun to watch then there are the bad twists you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie i m talking about you reindeer games or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid screwed perfectly suits the latter description what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs larry flynt scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing whoops screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments norm macdonald stars as willard filmore a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich old insidious boss miss crock elaine stritch when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day willard is convinced by his best friend rusty dave chapelle to kidnap crock s beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars too excited to pay any attention the hapless losers plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends realizing they can make even more money decide to stage the fake kidnapping of course everything that could go wrong does the first forty five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear the more idiotic these characters get the more reckless the script becomes at one point i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters no you idiot i m not just talking about willard and rusty who were extremely annoying i m also talking about the cops in this film a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys headed by murder one s daniel benzali were just too clueless to forgive they give real cops bad names also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days looking almost identical to his penguin in batman returns every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief he just didn t belong in this movie macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was gross out humor is certainly not his forte if you re a fan of norm macdonald s other chaotic comedy dirty work you might actually love this near sequel otherwise don t get screwed out of your hard earned money 
by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer it s possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film s sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending which is an insulting cop out somewhere out there maybe there s a small cadre of film goers who will appreciate sphere s dubious charms but i m not among them i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by it s hard to understand why the rights were optioned sphere is the kind of first class mess that only a top line director with an a list cast can create with expectations high and how could they not be considering that another barry levinson dustin hoffman collaboration the excellent wag the dog is still playing in theaters something this bad can t help but look even worse the last time a big name big budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year s batman robin and everyone knows how that movie was received sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron s the abyss but somewhere along the way it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort event horizon science and philosophy which are used to good effect during sphere s first hour give way to mindless confusing action sequences attempts at characterization fall apart intelligent writing which is evident early on is replaced by hackneyed drivel special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness but all that is just in preparation for the ending which is inexcusably awful this is the time honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film there is some promise but it s all in the setup we re introduced to norman goodman dustin hoffman a psychologist who once wrote a report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered when one is found in the middle of nowhere feet below the surface of the pacific ocean norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee on the team with him are beth halperin sharon stone a biochemist who was once his student and lover harry adams samuel l jackson a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology and harold barnes peter coyote the government operative in charge of the mission together the five descend into the bowels of the ocean where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact for a while sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man meets alien situation the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship apparently from the future offer intriguing possibilities then right around the one hour mark that s the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever s left of titanic the virtually non stop action begins and once it starts the script becomes superfluous this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension but instead he relies on loud overbearing music strange camera angles and quick cuts to make things exciting additionally because none of the characters are well formed a common failing in anything penned by crichton who s more interested in technology than people viewers don t develop much of a rooting interest it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience what about that a list cast not surprisingly the most energetic performance is given by samuel l jackson but his harry isn t a person he s a walking plot device spouting occasionally witty dialogue dustin hoffman isn t lively or particularly good it s ironic that this which may be his worst work in a decade has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination for wag the dog sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion automatons would have been as effective then there s queen latifa who despite getting fifth billing in the credits ahead of liev schreiber who boasts at least quadruple her screen time has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count i like to think that levinson and hoffman recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance the low budget picture was filmed during sphere s lengthy pre production phase if that s the case forgiveness is granted i m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume jurassic park and the levinson directed disclosure come to mind even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process crichton s credit as a producer disallows him absolution he was a willing participant in a creative travesty no wonder sphere is being released in february in the midst of the early year s cinematic wasteland it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth consecutive weekend atop the box office heap 
in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early s came this french canadian co production by max fischer the movie is set in paris where its hero struggling american author david mirkine judd nelson at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity suffers a terrible writers bloc he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle laurence treill unfortunately she hangs out in jet set circles which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous her connection with powerful david caravan pierce brosnan would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller drama would probably be more appropriate genre label pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments low budget also becomes painfully visible and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film unfortunately this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed instead they would have to settle with pointless slow scenes involving nelson brosnan and laurence treill s attempts of serious acting all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone s precious time 
this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be one of the hottest writers in hollywood he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream then added the successful i know what you did last summer script to his mix and also created the popular tv series dawson s creek so when he asked to direct his first movie based on his first ever script written everyone and their grandma said sure go for it uhhm my question is did anyone bother reading this stupid script plot ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west mrs tingle and set to lose her scholarship to college when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story they end up tying her up and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman critique it s not so much that this is a bad movie than the fact that it sucks this movie is chock full of one dimensional characters contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on zero tension or thrills plot holes the size of my big ass lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie and molly ringwald vivica a fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery and to but unfortunately for williamson he went nowhere with the bright foundation making references to the exorcist and dr zhivago which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate he also forgot about suspense with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue sure katie holmes is cute and her co star marisa coughlan did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist worth two points out of my three on ten but how can we forgive the biggest one dimensional character in any film holmes rival in the film mrs tingle s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays and a transparent romance between holmes and some long haired dude hired to be the poor man s version of skeet ulrich who himself is a poor man s version of johnny depp all in all this movie was laughable for me provided me with no insight into anything demonstrated williamson s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability humanity or capacity to comprehend no hip lines no cheap thrills just a dull time at the movie theater if you want to see a funny teenage movie go see detroit rock city and thank my drunken sorry ass in the morning little known facts about this film and its stars kevin williamson s father was a fisherman kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally so is dawson leery on tv s dawson s creek a show kevin created he was once an aspiring actor in fact he even landed a bit part on tv s another world also williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs tingle which is also loosely based on the book killing mr griffin by the writer of i know what you did last summer lois duncan he has also come out and said that he is a gay man helen mirren was born in london england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff she is married to director taylor hackford whose works include devil s advocate and an officer and a gentleman this film was originally titled killing mrs tingle but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called wasteland this is actor barry watson first full feature film he has played the character of seth on tv s malibu shores several times 
best remembered for his understated performance as dr hannibal lecter in michael mann s forensics thriller manhunter scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight he s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do if you want to see some brilliant acting check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach s hidden agenda cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l i e which lot picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge big john feels the love that dares not speak its name but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light he s an even tempered funny robust old man who actually listens to the kids problems as opposed to their parents and friends both caught up in the high wire act of their own confused lives he ll have sex for pay with them only after an elaborate courtship charming them with temptations from the grown up world l i e stands for long island expressway which slices through the strip malls and middle class homes of suburbia filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a pretty transparent metaphor of dangerous escape for his year old protagonist howie paul franklin dano in his opening voice over howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road citing the l i e highway deaths of filmmaker alan j pakula songwriter harry chapin and his own mother on exit he s both fascinated and disturbed by the l i e and those feelings are projected onto big john who follows howie around in his bright red car but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn t want to do this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies he s a beast but ashamed of it l i e would have worked best as a half hour short film about howie s ill advised foray into big john s haven there is unnecessary padding with howie s miserable dad bruce altman in the hot seat for a white collar crime degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle class houses and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise ass gary terrio billy kay a handsome artful dodger rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui not that we needed another movie on that subject these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length concurrently the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted cox sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo is all bluff and bluster dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent we re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious calling haley joel it s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene the restraint is admirable but l i e s screenplay doesn t always give them the best material when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem the moment feels a bit too precious director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach s goldberg variations it s too much there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john s other boy toy walter masterson jealous over the newbie this plot thread predictably leads to violence not content to be a haunting observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world like terry zwigoff s superb ghost world cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note it s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex philosophical note in this regard l i e and countless other indie films share something in common with blockbuster action films problems are solved when the obstacle is removed how often does real life work this way to extend the question if a movie is striving for realism do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion 
i m guessing and from the available evidence it s not a great guess that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess stupidity ego and power mongering if so the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history it has already been well documented that the original title an alan smithee film became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re cuts against the will of director arthur hiller prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors guild mandated pseudonym of alan smithee that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor and you could just smell the disaster brewing if you re unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn you ll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up ostensibly it s a pseudo documentary account of a director named alan smithee eric idle who loses control of a big budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone whoopi goldberg and jackie chan all of whom appear as themselves when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called an alan smithee film which of course it already is smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it among the parties interviewed are the film s producer james edmunds ryan o neal and studio boss jerry glover richard jeni who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them it s bad enough that burn hollywood burn has literally not a single laugh for its entire blissfully brief minutes what makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once but twice or even three times michael ovitz references showgirls references oral sex references whoopi goldberg ted danson references all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas stock in trade the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency notably with the hilarious use of the word feminist as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film makers the brothers brothers cleverly identified as bad a and badder a among other unprintable things you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified those documentary captions for all their leaden obviousness allow the best insight into what s so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears the producer is a liar who slept in the white house the media are maggots and leeches working for publications like the new york slimes and newsleak with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don t miss the joke it doesn t even matter that eszterhas tags penile implant after his own name when he makes a cameo because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self deprecation this is a petulant schoolboy s idea of satire pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth the last stomach churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out takes over the closing credits the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away perhaps it was just a final desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career pity everyone involved with this excessive ego driven satire of excess and ego it s too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this otherwise you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees 
after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy i was ready for some mindless fun oh maybe something like tango cash maybe not mindless fun is one thing but brain dead slop is another matter altogether tango cash has lowest common denominator written all over it the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l a russell plays cash a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts stallone plays tango a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it he doesn t need the money in an effort to change his image stallone goes for a yuppie gq look in the film wearing spectacles and three piece suits the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names tango cash is unbearably noisy for starters there s harold faltermeyer s annoying synthesized score which gets old after four notes to make matters worse the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars the more the merrier in fact the movie begins with not one but two car chases there s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie screenwriter randy feldman s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it such as stallone s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent and stallone is no lawrence olivier it s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman s script and thinking i want to be in this movie the film s plot doesn t have one original bone in its body and again you have to point your finger at the screenwriting feldman s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book making tango cash altogether generic and predictable they simply could have called it action movie every character every twist and turn is stolen from television or from other movies adding insult to injury tango cash is about as believable as a road runner cartoon action movies don t have to be realistic but they should absorb you enough so that you re not thinking about the lack of realism the only artistic aspect of tango cash is the cinematography there are some spectacular shots especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires the film s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell unfortunately their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants the dialogue consists of nothing but one liners and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing it s a shame because with a workable screenplay russell and stallone could have turned tango cash into a charming lethal weaponesque adventure tango cash tries to maintain a light tone and you do laugh about once every five minutes seeing russell in drag is the movie s funniest moment but you probably already have seen it in the commercials furthermore the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence machine guns and torture generally don t mix well with comedy jack palance appears in tango cash doing what he does best playing a sleazy conniving villain his character however is run of the mill except for his strange obsession with mice like many movie villains palance likes to play games in fact he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room you have to wonder why palance doesn t just shoot the detectives in the head the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent teri hatcher plays stallone s sister and russell s love interest and she is just as pretty as can be but regrettably hatcher s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty every time she opens her mouth you cringe corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination there s really very little if anything to recommend in the film and more to the point tango definitely isn t worth a penny of your cash so don t bother 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies luckily my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half faces and poor sound quality but i couldn t help myself i got it well after watching it it indeed was a bad print i was glad i didn t dish out to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie this movie really sucks it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy for example how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail the songs are bad the acting is bad especially deepti bhatnagar s and the direction is the worst of all the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up i didn t even finish the movie i couldn t take it anymore note but if anyone out there liked aatish by the same director i guess you d like this movie it s practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff aditya panscholi is the sidekick again i was going to give it a zero but i personally like jackie shroff so i loosened up a little he looked fresh wore good clothes as always and his performance even though it wasn t his best was the only saving grace of the movie 
retrospective city of the living dead a film review by mike watson copyright mike watson i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as dim witted and by golly just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career this is not one of them two points in the movie s favour the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi keep things from falling totally into the abyss but by and large city of the living dead is a failure and like most cinematic failures it comes down to bad writing dumb performances and lousy direction the story starts in new york when during a seance a medium katherine mccoll sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich massachusetts for reasons we won t go into here this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist christopher george that scene in itself is a howler why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside and don t cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they re buried anyway off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world where various grisly goings on are already happening as all saints day approaches fulci s graphic gore is in evidence once again but here it only serves to further highlight the film s flimsy script and plodding direction the dialogue in all manner of speaking is unspeakable not bad in the quotable sense like an ed wood film but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious lets explain the plot type approach mccoll doesn t have a clue who her character is deadly serious one minute frivolous the next she at times is genuinely hard to watch and the geezer the actor s name escapes me who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses christopher george s performance is salvageable but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don t care in fact we don t care for anyone in city of the living dead though in other fulci films that hasn t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man as he was in the beyond as a director some of fulci idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here he constantly uses extreme close ups of people s eyes a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren t capable of and despite some gruesome violence he barely manages a single scare in the entire film long time collaborator fabio frizzi talented but always erratic offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro pop that s quite frankly embarrassing fulci s other films of this period may be flawed house by the cemetery the beyond the black cat but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey for completists only 
the last line or near to that honor is the great butler alfred the ubergod michael gough saying i think we need a bigger bat cave or something to that note that s exactly what this film is too big for its own good because it has too damn much cut batgirl out cut one of the villains it s too much to handle in one dosage it s so much that characters get left behind poor elle gets a mere scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way shape or form and elle deserves better this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher it s also the fourth worst in the series and second worst from joel the series has been declining since its stunning debut followed by the almost as stunning sequel and then the anti climactic third one first by joel this one s not anti climactic i knew it was gonna suck it s up to joel to make it fun though batman forever was fun this is a big bore of over produced action sequences and shallow characters i mean this one bit i m gonna put all the plot in one paragraph mr freeze ah nold who s wife was dying of some disease has become the new big villain these days he s a huge ex scientist who fell into some weird liquid hello joker and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body batman george and robin chris fight him a bit but find they re growing apart meanwhile another villain shows up poison ivy uma who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist john glover who kills her when she finds out he s used her research to develop an uberman bane who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had she emerges from her chemicals don t ask cause i can t tell ya as a sexy woman the real uma who s poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo meanwhile alfred s dying of the same disease mr freeze s wife has but in an earlier state than she and his niece barbara alicia comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade but soon well not really soon it takes her hours becomes batgirl meanwhile in an unfinished subplot bruce batman s alter ego if you forgot has been dating the lovely julie madison the even lovlier elle macpherson who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing end of her for all we know mr freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population don t ask the trio must team together as family to beat them there ya go not the whole story but no big context clues too much right right the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels however while tim burton nicely balanced the villain batman storyline although not wonderfully joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one he gets some corny speeches a couple clever lines and that s it maybe some stunts for all this i can t even comment on george clooney as batman i hardly saw the guy and when i did he had horrible dialogue to say i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode george is in between them he s not quintessential he s not horrible he s good but i m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort we ll get a good script and clooney will shine if he still has the job the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher last time we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy mr freeze we feel bad for his mental physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants arnold isn t very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points when he watches old movies of his wife he actually looks somber wow but uma makes the most of her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness it s like she s almost parodying herself in pulp fiction at points she s incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better as for the lower bat people chris is the same as he was in batman forever although i think his work in these is too hokey when he s best at quieter parts in scent of a woman or just plain cool parts in fried green tomotoes alicia i love the girl but she s not particularly good in this film she can hypotheitically act we all saw that in clueless but her lines kinda sound weird and it isn t the mushy mouth this time but in all fairness she has virtually no part joel gets around to her occasionally and when she s on she does stupid stuff although i know i m not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma and poor elle poor poor elle i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act for those of us who saw sirens but she has no part it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product there are no couch scenes like my best friend noticed now listen to me on this one in every batman flick there s a couch scene in the original it was with vicki in returns it was a good make out scene with selena and in the last one it was a chat with nicole this one it s nothing and batgirl does next to nothing in this film till the end when she s suddenly part of the family fortunately we get a lot of alfred he s the always reliable butler in case you didn t know who has been with bruce all his life he s a god he s a father figure he s also dying this got to me i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe not in his tux and freaking dying just gets to me we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time but this is never answered as this film is too cluttered but in defense it does have some good parts other than uma for one george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do and there are some nice touches when they show the asylum at one point they show the patient s belongings in a room and we see the riddler s costume i laughed and during a biker scene involving robin and batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad asses dressed as droogs from a clockwork orange i laughed at all these the film falls apart around the five minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around minutes or did it just feel like that the film should serve as another in the long line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays people are fed up with stupid films that s why the word of mouth killed the lost world that s why last year indy films grossed more than ever that s why this will have a strong box office initative from people who just want to see it like me but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it that s why the next two big budget aciton pics are john woo s face off and barry sonnenfeld s men in black both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste i like some of his films flatliners a time to kill but a lot of them suck he s a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that s what makes him great but his costuming for woody allen s sleeper was more interesting than this one and his costuming was cool look for the nazi number i love the batman series the first two rocked and i did like the last one but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three hopefully this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time and maybe they ll get smart and bring back catwoman and michael keaton but we can only hope 
i suppose it s unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it s release michael lehmann s action comedy was quick to win the title biggest box office flop of all time or close thereof the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk who s just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation let me put it this way he explains i never saw et greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime played by danny aiello who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences it appears as if director lehmann didn t know when to stop all the absurd silliness and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn t get goofier you ll soon be eating your words but i m inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it s box office numbers suggest it s fast paced and entertaining if you ve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor for the first portion of this review i m going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk wish me luck first and foremost bruce willis is a good sport while i m not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co wrote this script willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big fat ugly joke he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out of place which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican and their relationship escalates in interest from there it s unfortunate that mcdowell s one note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot twist and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis but now i m rambling on again about the negative things aren t i enough of the charade for the most part hudson hawk is an excruciating experience it s stupid pointless and repetitive i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater because this film really doesn t have the potential to please anyone action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of comedy and even the action sequences are skittery rushed and poorly edited and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache inducing hi jinks don t get me wrong this film is not devoid of laughs it s too bad most of them are unintentional or just plain forced the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed it s understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i m not entirely sure coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film things get more bizarre when we re introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless card flipping kit kat if that s not enough for you there s richard e grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover their crotch biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here wait maybe the only big laughs i m not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk i can t even begin to start about the film s absurd plot but let s not get into that i suppose there s some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise if they were that desperate but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it s going from minute one and from there it s minutes of pure cinematic muck

under any other circumstances i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review however in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful a minute dissection of the ending is necessary even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes do proceed at your own risk the movie opens quite poorly i might add as child psychologist malcolm crowe bruce willis looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm s past patients distraught the suicidal man a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself cut to the next fall as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case a trouble young man named cole haley joel osment one of the only child actors in a while i didn t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument after about minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences we learn that cole has the sixth sense the gift of being able to communicate with the dead and this as they say is where the healing begins the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film one of roger ebert s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of siskel and ebert although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise i ve always been a sucker for surprise endings my favorite movie is the usual suspects and rarely dislike a film that sports one here since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film s conclusion the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending something i ve fallen victim to in the past was eliminated and indeed my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment stripped of the element of surprise the film was put to the task of showing what it really had instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion after seeing its true colors i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is despite what the many champions of the movie may say void of any real power it s a neat concept but not one that justifies being made into a feature length movie in fact the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth shattering revelation that is yet to come and when the final moments do come it s a huge letdown the end makes no sense at all it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level i won t go into any details but suffice to say that as far as i can tell it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder now in all fairness i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending however stupid it may be had it not been revealed to me before hand however i feel very confident that i as well as anyone who had seen a few twilight zone episodes would have seen it coming a mile away the fact that movie goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped ironically to fully appreciate the best scene that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl s funeral the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy i wouldn t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn t by pure dumb luck caught dateline nbc the other week when they did a feature story on it despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace in the end the sixth sense is too chalk full of contradictions and just isn t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation 
by the numbers a film which introduces characters situations dilemmas and developments that we ve seen before in a parade of other films a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one a film which is packed to the cap with predictability leading to very little tension excitement suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience in short a clich ridden formula film welcome to my review of the general s daughter plot an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter s rape torture and murder they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush hushes to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder critique by the numbers see above this film is just there it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours floats around goes away hopefully never to be heard from again it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away it s as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree it s as action packed as a canadian curling tournament get the picture i sure did it s too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot and to break down each scene before it was even completed easy as pie it s unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film but alas t was not to be that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted woods chews it up in the few scenes that he s in travolta passes the test cromwell plays well cromwell and stowe is window dressing with a smile mia since monkeys it seems and this predictability isn t reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen it s like riding a bike other scenarios which sponge out any tension suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually breaking down to the investigators without much reason given a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the best poor man s michael bay doing his best poor man s impression of tony scott add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half open shades for grit and integrity and an all out rainfall for the finale for further chaos and you re a great director yawn yeah whatever tony i mean simon and aren t we all sick of hearing about these army bad boys and their overdone code of silence enough already next subject please see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman otherwise save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead you ll feel much better afterwards trust me little known facts about this film and its stars ironically john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman which eventually went to little dickie gere ironically on james woods part he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv s welcome back kotter starring none other than john travolta actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his big dick on howard stern s radio program unlike rocker tommy lee woods is also alleged to have an iq of he apparently scored a perfect on his verbal sats and a on the math section what a man john travolta is married to actress kelly preston and they have a son named jett travolta loves them planes word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis home director simon west s first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air before that he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants yippee veteran director john frankenheimer ronin the manchurian candidate portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day clarence williams iii who plays colonel fowler in this film is known to some from his role as linc in the original mod squad tv series younger folk may remember him as prince s father in purple rain 
after s falling down i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director since then he has offered us two so so adaptations of john grisham novels the client and a time to kill and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher s potential the publicity for his latest release mm raised new hope it promised to be something unusual it wasn t the plot goes like this tom welles nicolas cage is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman allegorically named mrs christian myra carter to investigate an mm movie found among her late husband s belongings the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask who reminds me of bane in schumacher s batman robin because murders can be realistically simulated in movies mrs christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead by combing through missing persons reports tom finds the girl s name and tracks her to los angeles with the aid of max california joaquin phoenix a video store clerk and another symbolic name tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader s hardcore in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter both films are modeled on dante s the inferno of course mm makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil hardcore is a much more subtle and meaningful film mm had a lot of promise in its better moments it s an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom one moment of the first sort when we first meet max he s reading truman capote s in cold blood underneath the cover of a porn novel in cold blood was the father of the true crime genre which is the literary equivalent of snuff films max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom dance with the devil and the devil don t change the devil changes you tom does change i ll let you discover the specifics for yourself but not permanently schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn t have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn t come back walker s seven did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise cage tries hard to pull it off but the script doesn t give him enough to work with phoenix walks away with the movie he s smart charming and funny other cast members include fargo s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and the sopranos s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far in the last analysis since mm falls short of its pretensions and its promise its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege however unlike other predictable fare in the genre last year s twilight for example mm is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is 
darren jason biggs wayne steve zahn and j d jack black have been best friends since the fifth grade like the three musketeers they ve been together through thick and thin but when darren meets an attractive but cold blooded and manipulative psychiatrist judith amanda peet the long time friendship is placed in danger it s up to wayne and j d to rescue their best friend in saving silverman silverman has its heart in the right place but the story by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren s soul based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake the story is centered on the three life long amigos when wayne introduces darren to judith he doesn t realize that he has opened a pandora s box of disaster for himself and j d judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match since then she has sought a new mate someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision enter darren silverman once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement wayne and j d try everything they can including threats and bribery to get judith to free darren nothing works until the duo come up with a plan kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only pretty sandy perkus amanda detmer the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j d play cupid the boys even bring their idol neil diamond into the picture to help resolve things thinking about it this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black the pair is able to elicit the film s only laughs with their goofy antics and child like behavior they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne the brains of the gang jack black has the big guy moves of a chris farley giving j d an amusing physical presence the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material the rest of the cast doesn t fare as well though jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do though having watched his previous films american pie and loser i m not sure what attraction biggs actually has amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith there is no humanity at all to her character as she single mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind s image she s a monster that wayne and j d must defeat to save their friend unfortunately there is no dimension to her character amanda detmer brings nothing or gets nothing as darren s one and only r lee ermey as the psychotic coach made a bad decision taking this role tune meister neil diamond gives a good natured cameo perf as the boys idol and savior production values are on par with the rest of the film lackluster and non involving director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like big daddy and beverly hills ninja but falls flat with saving silverman the movie year has yet to provide us with a good film to sink our teeth into at least with saving silverman we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy i give it a c 
five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there is this starting to sound familiar by mistake the girls accidentlly open the box big surprise huh and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one betcha didn t see that one coming hard to die i found out while watching the film is a sequel to sorority house massacre nightie nightmare r a m r two of the actresses from sorority house massacre are in this film robyn harris and melissa moore but they play different characters here orville ketchum is also back as get ready for this orville ketchum yes the same character from number two yes he is also built like a tank in this film too i m telling you a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn t harm him at all the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act well they seemed to have lost that ability thankfully for my sanity i also saw the film warlock which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out analyzed and discarded before it happens there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot while we are on the subject of the story the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager s office i m sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary ridiculous and hurts the story more if that is still possible the script for this film is completely pathetic the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along here is an example of the wonderful dialog the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a really big gun the line is my dad used to be a marine i bet i can work it this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy now we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan has been presented one comment from an actress is not a lot of strategy involved but i like it i m afraid folks that this is about as good as they get now lets talk about the great special effects for this film this obviously wasn t a big concern of the film makers the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer s intelligence a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the th movie are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get the continuity department was obviously asleep along with the viewers when watching this film in one shot actress has cloths on camera angle changes actress seems to have lost clothing very impressive trick the one half plus that this film has going for it is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny and so the viewer can get some enjoyment from the film however this doesn t make it worth the rental fee of over a penny in the acting department the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least oh well win some lose some 
synopsis al simmons top notch assasin with a guilty conscience dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell making a pact with malebolgia a chief demon there simmons returns to earth years later reborn as spawn a general in hell s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives chains and a morphing cape sullen wise cogliostro and flatulating wisecracking violator vy for spawn s attention comments when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics where he had made a name for himself as a first rate comic book penciller on the spider man titles to join the newly formed creator owned image comics a new comic book legend was born spawn mcfarlane s spawn immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the s mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max the early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing with the popularity of spawn and the success of the current warner bros s batman film franchise a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn in the summer of hence new line cinema released spawn a live action film based on the groundbreaking series this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book like me numbed by how much spawn misses the mark what happened why is spawn so bad todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo i don t think however that his presence necessarily hurt or helped the film i place the blame in part on the recent hollywood trend fueled by public demand apparently for special effects blow out movies utilizing the latest computer technology these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out of nowhere glowing eyes or constantly transforming demons a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid don t get me wrong but because the script and cast aren t engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath spawn s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level mcfarlane s spawn was a tortured hero a mercenary by trade al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda having died and journeyed to hell he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda simmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body a creepy mess and his wife married despite his sometimes violent nature readers couldn t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so when the characters are developed they seem absurd rather than touching the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world do not help matters spawn in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman also unwisely spends too much time on a villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman john leguizamo like jack nicholson in batman receives top billing in the cast as the violator michael jai white al simmons spawn is second i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator the film however spends so much time on the violator s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film as nicholson was in batman especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn the violator s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing he would leave leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role but he is seen far too often in the film michael jai white a relative newcomer to theatrical releases seems to be an appealing actor and he handles his role adequately but we see little of him without various masks on more time needed to be spent on white s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over the top obnoxious evil general wynn easily the hammiest performance in the movie it s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now sheen s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down mtv style jerky in your face editing is one of them flames for example roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting cogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves as a poor narrator for the film he goofily tells the audience at one point that how much of spawn s humanity is left remains to be seen as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another the music finally assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes to be fair however marilyn manson s long hard road out of hell effectively compliments spawn s return to earth while filter and the crystal method s can t you trip like i do proves a surprisingly fitting theme song for as good a comic book as it is spawn did not spawn a good movie spawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development it receives two stars for its technically well done special effects many other films though have equal if not superior special effects and are much better rated pg spawn seems more violent than many r rated movies and probably wouldn t be appropriate for the very young 
writer director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the s yes that s right he co wrote raiders of the lost ark the empire strikes back and return of the jedi now with this film it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing and guess what he succeeds once again plot a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open armed swarm of people with problems it isn t long before he befriends the small town billionaire folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients critique this film is not a comedy it is a drama i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer you would think that this film secures its base in humor but unfortunately for us it does not it is a serious film seriously flawed if you ask me but i digress which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake but overall just sits there now on to my review this movie sucks because it was slow and boring starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst and certified it all with many a predictable ending i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture but whatever it was he missed anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff piece which on a good day might be described as predictably digestible it s no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy it sucks as a drama and bored my movie cohort right to sleep i ve given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks first of all i couldn t help but think about how much the lead actor loren dean looked like a young charles grodin he even acted like him save for the dry sardonic wit this kept me interested in watching him at least number two and this one is really shallow seemed to be geared that way as well there were quite a few titshots as they would say back in high school and god help me if i can t get enough of those in an aimless drama and three and this one surprised me the most actor ted danson s cameo yes he will always be sam malone to us real fans was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person a different asshole but a different person nonetheless if ever you rent this movie one day promise you won t throw away your hard earned money at the theaters wait for his scene because it s actually pretty good other than that drab drab drab and drab even jason lee a personal favorite of mine was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while well at least he finally came out and did some real skateboarding in this movie oh yeah and i guess that s the fourth point in my rating anyway if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist this film s your bag otherwise skip it and see analyze this again now there s a great shrink movie little known facts about this film and its stars three s company fans alert terri from the tv show also known as actress priscilla barnes plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage so stay tuned kids also it is to note that the actress was once named penthouse pet of the month in march of she was known as one joann witty back then she s originally from jersey who the hell is loren dean the dude who plays mumford in this film you got me but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in and played the character of billy bathgate in the film of the same name jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp he s been in every kevin smith film except for clerks listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince make a reference to the lost ark which is obviously an in joke considering that it is the writer director of this film lawrence kasdan who co wrote raiders of the lost ark kasdan also played the part of dr green in s as good as it gets ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan s directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt 
dead bang an action thriller starring don johnson lives up to its dumb title or at least to half of it although dead bang is definitely dead it is anything but a bang in fact they should have called this one dead bore in the film johnson plays you guessed it a cop the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character jerry beck is a gritty los angeles homicide detective a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on miami vice a la mel gibson in lethal weapon beck is an emotional wreck complete with violent outbursts unscrupulous police methods and a bleak outlook on life beck s wife has just divorced him and she is cutting him off from their children she will not even allow him to wish them merry christmas by telephone but beck s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead bang beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop his investigation starts in l a and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp virtually every aspect of dead bang is inept and ineffective the plot is incoherent and full of holes the movie depicts beck s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions the action sequences in dead bang are strictly third rate and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense i certainly expected more from long time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller the manchurian candidate as well as black sunday seven days in may and the french connection ii in all fairness to frankenheimer however i should note that most of dead bang s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction dead bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting according to the movie s production notes dead bang is based on the real life experiences of still active detective jerry beck you would never guess this from watching dead bang however since the film totally lacks credibility it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable most of the characters in dead bang are either atrociously acted underdeveloped superfluous or all of the above william forsythe for example is painfully bad as arthur kressler a wholesome by the book fbi agent who s offended by beck s foul language and unorthodox methods forsythe s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable dead bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid wkrp in cincinnati and frank s place but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains the sole function of penelope ann miller s character is to give dead bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less i guess the film s title refers to this love scene since it s definitely a dead bang the only real virtue of dead bang believe it or not is don johnson who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie s pitiful script johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life and i must admit that dead bang does have one or two amusing moments the funniest scene has johnson throwing up all over a criminal as he interrogates him but when barf is the highlight of a movie you know the movie s in trouble the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck in which he can t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make 
 with all that education you should know what happiness is starring sylvia chang teresa hu hsu ming li lieh mao hsueh wei directed by edward yang written by yang and wu nien chen cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui kung every country has eventually its new wave france had its nouvelle vague brazil its cinema novo china its fifth generation and on and on some waves just take longer than others before they wash over us cleansing us with the balm of discovery taiwan s new wave came in the s in the work of directors like hou hsiao hsien wan jen and edward yang that day on the beach yang s first feature is central it created a new language for young taiwanese directors even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here giving taiwan a distinctive international presence that day itself is long and frustrating the document of a nation s attempt to find a voice it does not lack ambition it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan in the manner of antonioni elaborating the alienation that the westernized white collar middle class feel as their lives are shaped by old fashioned roles dedicated career men loyal housewives that they find unfulfilling jia li sylvia chang is the focus but the film brings others into its compass her husband her brother friends from her college days as it charts her discontents no one is happy jia li married her husband we lei at a young age at the time her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage despite his affection for another woman and so jia li s marriage seemed in comparison a good one she chose we lei of her own free will they loved each other but it goes wrong that day dutifully presents all the clich s we lei becomes absorbed in his career indulges in an affair with a co worker jia li feels restless and trapped bound by a choice she made while young but which no longer seems wise the film never redeems these clich s by conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured it unfolds awkwardly as a series of flashbacks told during a luncheon in vienna where jia li meets her brother s old flame teresa hu now a concert pianist whom she has not seen since college both women seem rather sad and resigned to their sadness their circumstances and those of jia li s brother and a college friend suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices married the wrong man chosen the wrong career path etc but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate it is not that jia li married the wrong man she didn t the problem is that she needed to marry at all and that if she did not marry she would still be just as unhappy for a woman in modern taiwan that day tells us the cards are stacked the dice are loaded she can play the game but the house always wins the film s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan seen now it does not seem provocative indeed it s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy it may be ambitious it may be innovative but it is also terribly terribly dull and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others and his use of those methods is fumbling uncertain undisciplined nor does he bring anything new other than the locale to the material there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for in a young couple s first kiss in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband s mistress but they are brief too often yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes grocery shopping flower arranging in which nothing happens little is said no emotion imparted perhaps if the film were content to focus on such reflective inward moments leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings it might have been ambiguous suggestive insinuating but jia li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence they talk about their problems at length in detail redundantly and eliminate all subtleties at two hours and forty five minutes it all seems exorbitantly long indulgently long winded consider the defining moment for jia li the titular day on the beach the thrust of the whole film explains easily enough what we are to think of that moment what it means when she walks away from a particular situation even so the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally in case we may have missed the point needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed and that is the problem throughout the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn out narrative it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle at least it s his name in the credits who is now rightly regarded as one of the world s leading cinematographers in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar wai he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image you would never know it from watching that day which due either to doyle s inexperience or yang s humdrum direction is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience but none of the damage none of the heartbreak 
tomb raider fun exciting challenging given the unprecedented popularity especially among teenage boys of the video game that sports an uber buff pistol packin babe who raids well tombs you have to believe it s these three things and more lara croft tomb raider the big screen variant of said video game which features a pumped up angelina jolie the oscar winner for girl interrupted no less in the title role is however none of these things it isn t fun it isn t exciting and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat i suffered through to the bitter bitter end the wife opted for barnes noble at the minute mark directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to con air tomb raider is an empty headed big budget bore the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys hudson hawk the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that when brought together well who the heck cares and it makes super mario bros bob hoskins ill advised career move look like rocco and his brothers that classic of italian neo realism i ll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there s actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper this is where the jolie defenders video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn t about character development it s about kicking serious butt or bum since ms croft hails from england s green and pleasant with lips breasts and biceps all inflated to the max lara croft is all about posturing and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough ok let s forget challenging shouldn t tomb raider be at the very least fun and exciting shouldn t our butt kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of say james bond with the wit of indiana jones there s no humor to be found anywhere in tomb raider even though it tries hard from time to time even the mummy returns didn t take itself too seriously the villain here is noticeably lacking the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated and the script is non existent to liven things up perhaps jolie s live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara s dead father lord croft talk about a stretch one thing i hadn t expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa although i suspect that thin looking moustache he s forced to wear gets in the way some unsuccessful not entirely if anything lara croft tomb raider makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about 
if i were to plot a graph of year against movie plot ridiculity for hollywood movies you ll probably see a line with constant gradient now if i were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael bay jerry bruckheimer has made over the last years that line would be exponential in growth the team started out with the will smith vehicle bad boys which was no more than a hr long action music video nevertheless entertaining then came the rock where audiences flocked to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing general fighting over some stupid cause con air was ridiculousy dumb in its premise but it did have fun moments and who can forget the nursery rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi while these movies worked because there was something better to cover up the dirt armageddon does not very much like deep impact a meteor is heading towards earth and they didn t realize it until days from impact deep impact settled with the modest meteor size as large as the city of new york but armageddon just had to be bigger well about the size of texas that kinda meteor whould probably knock earth out of its orbit the panic of this sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor drill it then nuke it sounds familiar and who better to do such a job than harry stamper bruce willis your very own oil driller extraordinaire and his team of macho misfits nursing the tagline there ain t nothin on this planet that harry can t drill in that days harry s group was split into teams trained for deep space flight and finally blasted into space in with special drilling vehicles on new space shuttles the main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the relationship of harry a j and grace to give you an idea a j works for harry and loves grace harry s daughter the problem is harry hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself for the rest of her life so while a j and harry struts it out grace is place in a position where she is unable to take sides so she remains seated in the nasa control tower crying over both of them in about of the movie the human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more than just an excuse for more slow mo s and gold tinted photography the anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying running for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky sounds fine right i know but it looks too out of place on screen too staged if you were to ask yourself what s the difference between armageddon and a r b music video you d probably just said the music not surprising since michael bay is a child of that industry and has actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully his foray into armageddon just proves that he doesn t when to stop well there s really nothing much to sum up here the stock aitken waterman of hollywood movies have projected their art form into ridiculity beyond the plane believability where people still accept even if they didn t believe deep impact was ridiculous in most aspects and i believe the makers know this the thing is they decided to shroud myth and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of suffering and coming in terms with ones problems which ultimately brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in armageddon is an overcrowded loud messy preposterously manipulative waste of money and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash if you have planned to watched this over deep impact because of liv tyler bruce willis or the tagline from the makers of the rock please catch deep impact before it finishes its run it may be the only meteor worth watching in long long time if you have to see it please bring ear plugs and some aspirins for the vertigo expect armageddon ld s to retail at s at carrefour come release time gee even that s not worth it 
wolfgang petersen s latest the perfect storm is like a pineapple it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging if you try to eat the fruit spikes and all it s going to hurt quite a bit ok maybe that was a confusing analogy so here s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick there isn t really much of a story to tell basically a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat called the andrea gail and gets stuck in the middle of the storm of the century how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story not nearly enough so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous audiences want to see the storm they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched maudlin drivel the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect but just try lasting the first three quarters i have yet to read sebastian junger s the perfect storm but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale based on a true story the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version the approach is weak using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner petersen almost hides the in your face banality right away the central characters are introduced the gritty determined captain george clooney the ingenue mark wahlberg torn between his job and his girlfriend diane lane the loving father john c reilly the comic relief who s always trying to get laid john hawkes the new guy william fichtner who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet french guy allen payne so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer it is not the all star cast s fault just the characters designed for their portrayal allen payne s character never speaks in the entire movie not because he is mute but because he s never given any lines are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with fichtner s character is terribly underdeveloped we don t know what he s doing there where he s from or who he s supposed to be the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene you know what would look good on you me ooooh real creative as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters the crew continues to not feel human only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk the computer generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real i can only imagine if this was an imax film this city kid would surely never go in the water again this is loud jolting entertainment adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so i guess i ll stick to that other survival spectacle you know the one on cbs 
miramax disinvited on line media from press screenings of scream they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler filled reviews and post them prior to the film s february th release date unsound reasoning you see net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on line film critics society ofcs and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain t it cool news no the mini major was afraid we d let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit that scream is a dismal conclusion to the beloved by this writer at least franchise something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get go cotton weary liev schrieber the former lover and would be killer of maureen prescott sidney s mother is juggling phone calls in his luxury car once considered a danger to society weary now hosts his own talk show cotton a clever if dated jab at american pop culture of course a new ghostface dials him up and with memories of scream s unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind we immediately wonder where is the killer the backseat the next car thrilling prospects to be sure but actually ghostface is at the weary residence waiting for cotton s girlfriend kelly rutheford to finishing showering what s missing from this sequence and indeed scream s remaining frights most disappointingly the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes one of which might spring to life is an elaborate and attenuated payoff our other surviving regulars have become estranged sidney campbell is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password protected locks while dewey arquette acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream s movie within a movie stab and gale weathers cox arquette headlines a gossipy news program murder reunites them as knife wielding ghostface stalks the set of stab imitating its sadistic screenplay and his her their own personal draft climaxes with sidney s death the appeal of ghostface s villainy is that he she they could be your boyfriend your classmate your next door neighbour or a combination of people scream was the first of its kind a slasher mystery with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next but also who is are the perpetrator s and what is are his her their motive ironic self reflection aside parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the th and halloween flicks because there s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume with scream the novelty of ghostface s ever mutating identity has worn off some but the character remains conceptually potent conceptually the execution of ghostface s master plan this time around is creaky because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we d come to understand in scream and scream the movie gets in the silly habit of saying all bets are off in reference to the rules of a trilogy s third act but there s a difference between rule breaking and cheating with the departure of kevin williamson who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream that for reasons incomprehensible to me was ignored save the notion of stab kruger needed to be reined in tighter and by wes craven craven s direction of scream is lazy in most respects how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo the slacker duo of kevin smith movies akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny it pains me to write this but scream s comedy is generally laughless with the exception of well timed performances by josh pais as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven s music of the heart jamie kennedy resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream and parker posey through sheer force of will as a b actress the visuals are much weaker in part three as well the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before aside in the wake of columbine craven toned down the violence significantly for scream why the sanctimony when scream and scream are still readily available on video store shelves finally marco beltrami s music cues the suspense too blatantly do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream it s mostly silent sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere here they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve jangling score i look at scream as coming from an alternative universe the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii woefully out of synch with its prequels scream is a nightmare instead of nightmarish and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t part three must disappoint 
a pseudo intellectual film about the pseudo intellectual world of art magazines high art is as wasted as its drug addled protagonists in the only notable part of the movie ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles not that lisa cholodenko s script or direction makes you care much about either character living in a world of heroin induced highs they float along until they fall in love with each other this uninviting picture full of pretentious minor characters has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant year old syd radha mitchell who has a rather bland live in boyfriend was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine frame although the receptionist is impressed syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ally sheedy for her to do photos for frame lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her lucy lives with her current lover a washed up german actress named greta played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope usually heroin this does not happen in a single episode but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture syd who lives in the apartment below them joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs which apparently is funded by her mother lucy quit working professionally years ago since she thought she was being pigeonholed and since her mother has money we can only assume that that s how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer s work is transcendental or merely classical that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny your work has a cultural currency that is important now is the artist speak that the frame s manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd her idea of a romantic line is i want to get high with you in lucy s world sex and drugs come hand in hand and the movie except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions in another movie it might have worked but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted high art runs it is rated r for explicit sex pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age
