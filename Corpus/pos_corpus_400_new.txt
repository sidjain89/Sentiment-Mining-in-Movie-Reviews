magnolia left me relling from the theatre staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft at nearly three and a half hours magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film it not only demands your attention but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions it is delirious depressing heady pretentious surreal filmmaking it s also a movie that will polarize its viewers director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn t let up until an oddly exhilerating biblically influenced pseudo climax the character s make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives there is frank mackey tom cruise a slithery snake charmer of men whose search and destroy seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants there is earl partridge jason robards a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son there is game show host jimmy gator phillip baker hall a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public and there is police officer jim kurring john c reilly who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process given equal weight are stories involving a coke addled emotional cripple melora walters a former tv quiz show champion william h macy a materialistic adulterous wife julianne moore a child jeremy blackman victimized by a mentally abusive parent and a caring empathetic nurse philip seymour hoffman hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death lies and despair it is not a pleasant movie there is not one bad note in the acting it is affecting and layered and wonderful there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene walters plays her character with red eyed rawness and a fierce self destructiveness that is anxiety inducing robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man who still hears a lion s roar when he speaks director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote the problem is that he stays on them too long julianne moore s character linda quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt tears screaming and remorse and never backs off from it after a few hours it turns from interesting to chinese water torture quite a few scenes such as the game show go on just a bit too long and will be off putting for those used to a pat minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around and just what is the theme alienation hopelessness anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn t make it easy the film starts by showing three strange and seemingly unrelated events it s a harbinger of the synchronicity to come at times different stories reach reach key moments at the same time other times stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory regardless of what else is happening anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film what s surprising is that it mostly works if you have doubts about anderson s intentions i ll ask you to pay attention to the final frame despite all the sturm und drang magnolia ultimately speaks to man s capacity for hope and attempts at redemption despite magnolia s needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur showing off fro the masses i have to admire his guts this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling my rating a bulleye stars a side note helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful when she sings save me at the end it enhances the yearning felt by the characters just as wise up mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives

hilarious ultra low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers brian o halloran and jeff anderson they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self fulfillment the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get out but you could spend ten times the film s budget a reported and still not get dialogue half as good as this originally rated nc for language not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears killing zoe remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you re halfway to killing zoe writer director roger avary s slow moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in way over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers he s the safecracker who s blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go though intriguing on all fronts the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction which avary co wrote with quentin tarantino in english and french the road to wellville based on the novel by t coraghessan boyle the road to wellville doesn t go very far bowels bowels and more bowels are explored by dr john harvey kellogg a buck toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins who in the early s advocated abstinence vegetarianism and frequent defecation he also invented the cornflake really checking in to kellogg s battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda just two of the many well known faces in this failed comedy leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack michael lerner lara flynn boyle john neville and dana carvey the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing but the novelty quickly wears off as writer director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo doo into drama what he ends up with is something that i can t print here phew stargate lawrence of arabia meets star wars this epic sci fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else director roland emmerich universal solider shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on the film is overlong the characters are cardboard and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci fi history that said there s still plenty to watch here sci fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands the morphing headdresses and a surprisingly spunky james spader he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that somebody else built the pyramids less interesting are co stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame star trek generations trek fans may be more forgiving but for the rest of us the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best the story is interesting but each scene goes too long the cast is earnest but the direction lacks punch and so on the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii original enterprise captain james t kirk appears on both ends of the story though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead get a life remarkably unremarkable miracle on th street in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al maybe a remake of miracle on th street is necessary john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the original the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn t work too well but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle his chemistry with children can moisten any eye no claus for alarm junior arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sure billy crystal did it before in rabbit test but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie what should be nothing more than a one joke premise actually gets better as it goes along director ivan reitman dave twins wisely keeps the farce to a minimum so the first hour moves slower than you might expect don t expect too many yuks from danny devito but you can t beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie how s that for a collision of acting styles 
 you ll go ape over tarzan because it s more fun than a barrel of monkeys okay there s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie disney s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship father mother and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson it s amazing the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack before you know it an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala glenn close a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard against the wishes of her mate and family leader kerchak lance henricksen she takes on the infant boy as her own tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild much of tarzan s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his father which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well meant his attempts all he s looking for is acceptance perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers but one which will ring true with a lot of adults when you really think about it this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end look back on past disney animated features and you ll see the trend growing up tarzan voiced by alex d linz as a child and by tony goldwyn as an adult has a couple of friends one is an ape named terk rosie o donnell and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor wayne knight both provide the requisite comic relief timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold i m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films just fill in the blanks can you see it now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it we ve already had a fish and a crab and we ve had a candle and a teapot a genie and a dog a few stone statues have we had an ape and an elephant yet well there we go of course there s gotta be romance somewhere along the line so jane minnie driver gets introduced about halfway through together with her father dr porter nigel hawthorne and the big game hunter clayton brian blessed jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory you tarzan me jane scene thankfully those aren t the exact words however i found it distracting that tarzan is going ohh ohh ee ee one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction how does he tell his name to another ape ohh ohh ee tarzan ee ee ohh well regardless of my picky nature the romance actually works as only disney romance can purely contrived but for some reason rather believable but hey tarzan s a young adult do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane isn t that illegal in most countries oh well i don t think disney will be using my quote anymore tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical there s lots of music to be sure but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time we instead get more of a phil collins concert as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material this isn t really a bad thing as the songs are very high energy and catchy i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day it s just different do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie with each new feature disney animation gets even better not necessarily by leaps and bounds but since they put out a new film each year a steady rate of improvement is apparent and this definitely shows in tarzan there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near d effect and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers and had me thinking this isn t just tarzan it s extreme tarzan however tarzan does not seem to have what i call its chandelier scene which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort utilizing a computer assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking lasting but a few seconds at most it s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail as usual the voice talent is up to snuff convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters the one poor choice in casting however was rosie o donnell going into the film i didn t know she was even a part of it but when terk started talking i recognized her voice immediately her performance was fine but through the rest of the film i kept thinking that s no boy ape that rosie o donnell distracting to say the least i ll admit i ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story tarzan of the apes so i couldn t tell you how true this film stays to the book but unless you re a purist you should have few objections to this film with solid performances action adventure a bit of romance and great music and animation tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us note when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature this time i ll just say that i went to mcdonald s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry and tarzan was on the cup nuff said 
ingredients neophyte lawyer legal situations corrupt insurance company synopsis rudy baylor matt damon is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time rudy s girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband rudy s elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded and the family of rudy s friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn t pay for a bone marrow transplant rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser danny devito who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge danny glover jon voight plays leo f drummond the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all powerful insurance company s team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice will rudy defeat leo will he enjoy being a lawyer opinion the good news is that this movie has a happy ending and it features a guy trying to do the right thing director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie in the typical lawyer movie there s one big case and the movie focuses on solving it and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins after lots of gripping courtroom drama however coppola s movie is deliberately more low key the rainmaker plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters in the background rudy s voice narrates his feelings and makes half cynical jokes about the legal profession in general two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be first rudy s time is split juggling three cases rather than concentrating on a single high stakes case also rudy s use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win and rudy narrates his way into coming of age 
a miracle of filmmaking some like it hot is a brilliant film and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists it is the pinnacle of writer director billy wilder s career a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make jerry lemmon and joe curtis are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig trying to earn enough money to feed themselves one night as they re playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy the place is raided as it turns out the owner spats columbo george raft was ratted out by toothpick charlie george e stone several weeks later on valentine s day jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage eager to escape the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid the only catch its a girls band so josephine curtis and daphne lemmon make their way onto the train and go to florida on the way there they meet sugar kane monroe a bombshell singer who is looking for love jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer but there s two problems they re in drag and millionaire osgood fielding joe e brown falls madly in love with daphne what follows in pure hysteria still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the italian opera lovers festival tony curtis is hysterical as joe josephine especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar marilyn monroe in a wonderfully comic performance is sugar providing incredible timing and sex appeal along with true sincerity the scenes however are all stolen by either brown or lemmon lemmon is hysterical as daphne cast as the less rational one lemmon s performance is ridiculously crazy it is disorder in the style all billy wilder s brown is particularly hilarious as osgood as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony he manages to use lemmon s ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire every set piece is flawless as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture wilder s script is stunning as he carefully combines gangsters cross dressing romance sex music gender roles and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria so pitch perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece the final line of this absolutely incredible film wilder s is dead wrong when he says nobody s perfect billy wilder is especially when he makes something this disastrously funny nobody s perfect but billy wilder 
in an insider s look at a scandal ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination closely based on clinton s campaign was written anonymously former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship now the book primary colors has been made into a movie directed by mike nichols and in light of recent presidential scandals seems to be more relevant than ever but the film is more than a diatribe against or a paean in praise of the president it is a fascinating look at the political machinery and the ethical quagmire that surround modern politics jack stanton john travolta is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination he is charismatic but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign and strains his relationship with his wife susan emma thompson the film is told from the point of view of henry burton adrian lester grandson of a civil rights leader who is swept away by stanton s ideals and helps to organize the campaign he joins political strategist richard jemmons billy bob thornton looking an awful lot like james carville and campaign advisor daisy green maura tierney governor stanton s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him a fact that his chief rival lawrence harris kevin cooney consistently uses to his advantage to help clean up the stanton campaign jack and susan bring in an old friend libby the dustbuster holden kathy bates the acting throughout primary colors is superb it would be worth seeing the movie for bates wild performance alone she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton although his accent does stray a little emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom primary colors treads lightly on this issue though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans the movie touches on few actual political issues in fact most of the bad guys are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house rather than issues the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control although the film strays into some obviously non clinton territory it is difficult to completely separate it from reality particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president s current troubles primary colors chief problem is its length it runs about minutes too long there are some scenes which could have easily been cut for example midway through the film the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists the scene s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton s character which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film the extra length isn t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying but it mars an otherwise excellent film republicans democrats and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors it s a funny and at some times shocking look at the modern political process 
that thing you do from first time film director tom hanks is an enjoyable tale about a fictional band the wonders that goes from a garage band to the band with the fastest selling album in the country but the question arrises will the seduction of fame and fortune corrupt the band and lead them to become just another one hit wonder or will they stick together and become the next teen sensations the oneders as they are originally known have their first gig at a very small time contest jimmy the lead singer has written a catchy song and intends to play it at the contest but a short time before the contest begins the current drummer becomes injured and a replacement is needed enter guy patterson skilled musician who currently works at his father s appliance store and is looking to break free from the restricting clutches that bind him he seems to fit in well until the group takes the stage when they begin to play guy s beat is much too fast and the pace is way off for the intended song it looks as though the group is doomed to failure but the new song is a hit this leads to another gig and soon enough the group has an agent he doesn t do too much for them but they do get their song played on the radio eventually mr white of playtone records approaches the group and he informs them that they want to release a record before you can say billboard the band is now renamed the wonders and the members are speeding their way to fame the gigs are getting better their fame is increasing and they have the fastest selling album in playtone records history the band is invited to appear in a feature film and they then fly out to hollywood to appear on television after the appearance on television things start to fall apart two of the members of the band pretty much disappear and things are not working out well between jimmy and guy will the band work it out or will they split up and go on their own separate journeys towards success that thing you do complete with a nifty original song that actually sounded authentic is a fun and enjoyable movie that although it doesn t become clear if it wants to be a comedy drama or romance is a well made look into the world of music tom hanks directorial debut was a good one and should lead to more work for him 
when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space it really is too bad that comedies are so hit and miss because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver but weep not dear readers because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet austin powers the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i ve had the pleasure to see in a long time a completely looney delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks if all comedies or even half or what am i saying even a fifth of them could be this consistently hysterical i would take up residence at my local multiplex even more to this movie s credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the sleeper cult hit austin powers international man of mystery the original came out of nowhere it was a low budget eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america ironically powers yeeeeah baby yeah has almost become an icon of the late s thus another installment was inevitable but it s also undoubtedly welcome the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained over the top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor even if only briefly and adds new ones austin powers mike myers a swinging hipster from the s transported into the s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo oh you ll figure it out which dr evil meyers again has stolen he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the s to defeat dr evil yet again surprisingly the real star is dr evil rather than austin he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately instead of being the scheming villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling often sweet mad scientist wannabe the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original but that s okay by me because the original left us wanting more by the time that one was over we haven t had nearly our share of shag jokes crude puns and powers antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites even by its conclusions i m still not sure i ve had my fill of bits like do you smoke after sex i don t know baby i never looked this may seem awfully immature of me but understand that the austin powers series unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days is genuinely funny i don t know if i ve ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious just the two of us rendition by dr evil and his new miniature clone named mini me i don t have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did but as far as i m concerned that is enough eugene novikov 
mary norton s children s book series the borrowers has been made into several below average television movies so i wasn t too enthused as i entered the theater for the big screen debut of the minute clan but i was in for a shock the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home their aunt who owned the property never left a will now an unscrupulous lawyer ocious potter john goodman plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra modern housing development but the lenders are not alone in their house living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human beans above the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders so it is up to the clocks pod jim broadbent and homily celia imrie along with their kids arrietty flora newbigin and peagreen tom felton to recover the will and save the household but when potter learns of the tiny people he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff mark williams to kill off the clan there s plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers especially in the furnishings of the clock family house made out of lost board game parts and credit cards the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling based on an original story the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a inch tall person as the villain john goodman s performance veers on the edge of being over the top but his performance suits the role well and he does very well in the film s many slapstick moments with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets bluescreen shots and cgi the special effects in the borrowers are very well done there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children only movie for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch 
luckily some people got starship troopers some people knew it was supposed to be silly for those of you who didn t how could you miss it from the very beginning when we see an interactive internet like promotional video for the armed forces of the future it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly i guess without blatant one liners and home alone style slapstick some people just don t recognize such goofy humor such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned first thing to do before seeing this movie lighten up meet the equivalent of beverly hills meets mighty morphin power rangers four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces which in the future means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country johnny rico casper van dien is ready to join the infantry mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez denise richards has enlisted to be a pilot dizzy flores dina meyer has enlisted as a trooper and it s possible she s joining merely to follow rico whom she s always had eyes for if you saw these three on the street you d automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers for never has a movie s cast looked so much like the cut out cover of seventeen magazine the lone non supermodel carl jenkins played by doogie howser himself neil patrick harris is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie er carl out of the picture good call now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters right off the bat rico becomes the star of the show far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen leaves rico ready to call it quits with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home well sorry rico suave but there s no place like home especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it that s right the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid like alien beings that a can of raid just isn t going to destroy with a sudden change of heart and clothes rico is back in the game following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs what starship troopers really is is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on the soap opera like love affairs of high school the love for sci fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group etc nothing is taken seriously it s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless but with its sly and futuristic approach it s not as recognizably so it s a spoof so subtle that many won t recognize the spoofery if you deem this as sci fi action you re wrong it s sci fi action comedy with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film but the gore too is meant to be cheesy yes it s graphic but it s also brutally phony and that s what makes it such great fun to watch not since the old mr bill skits on saturday night live has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters barbie dolls as young children with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely it s a good chance this is the case whether we re fully aware of it or not starship troopers has it s slow parts but it s truly an alternative to your typical sci fi action flick or lame juvenile comedy aside from the intentionally cheesy gore the special effects are quite astounding when the spaceship passes a meteor it s quite an awesome spectacle visually crisp and captivating if you re looking for brainless fun this is the epitome of your search a beautiful cast awesome special effects fast paced action campy acting and a whole lot of gore this is brainless heaven just remember not to think 
there must be some unwritten rule that states one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere in the exotic morocco of a year old english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girls the year old lucy carrie and the year old bea bella has arrived for a year s stay with the self absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold one room london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech at least she says she is as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers she has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip doesn t seem like it s much fun more like a misadventure with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in drugs a world wide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here in this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an off handed but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud s grand daughter esther freud who traveled here in the s with her mother and sister it is written by the director s brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls the girls readily accept him and there is no big to do made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really don t know what to make of the relationship it especially bothers bea who is embarrassed by her mother s loose attitude and wants to go home things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village it seems only that bilal s charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has a wife who still lives there this scene didn t make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also but i doubt that the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many a drop out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves the family s travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts it will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldn t comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories a gift from god the film s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby boom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the film s strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girls are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who cares about the children but doesn t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she s at this is a very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being and after all is said and done who s to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was 
sam matthew broderick is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda kelly preston he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton tch ky karyo comes as a complete surprise to him but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton s apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them suddenly anton s ex maggie shows up but she does not want her former lover back on the contrary all she wants to do is vaporize him she may say that she doesn t want to kill him but the possibility doesn t bother her too much either after all people die every day in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times but we haven t griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since while you where sleeping the camera obscura adds a special something to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy everything about the movie is perfect from set design to casting the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite meg ryan known from when harry met sally or sleepless in seattle surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her much more so than in last years courage under fire where she played a gulf war pilot matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality the viewer can tell that he doesn t only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them he has trouble keeping in touch with reality after all who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love his naivet that we don t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge she would do anything to harm anton she doesn t hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier tch ky karyo is perfect as anton he is well repulsive that s all there is to say about him you can t really manage to pity him even after all his mishaps he not only took sam s bride away from him he is also a french chef worlds collide i e the usa and france this can only go wrong even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking you just can t sympathize with a man who plays je t aime moi non plus on his tape deck not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for sam certainly isn t too bad for anton for him things take a turn to the worse addicted to love is one of this year s most pleasant surprises 
up until about a year ago john travolta s career consisted of those look who s talking movies notice how they never called them look who s talented and the bomb shout which was bad enough to make most people scream but somewhere along the line travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in would experience fame and fortune once again while barry robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a straight to the cutout bin album aptly named size isn t everything and of course they learned that sales are everything but now travolta s back on the hollywood scene once again and i think we all know why four words contract with the devil and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich s contract with america no satan is much more humane anyway yes travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld how do i know i own the document in question amazing what you can buy at those collector s shops for a few hundred dollars isn t it get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction with travolta as crime minion chili palmer he goes to collect some of the mafia s money from a b grade director gene hackman and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game sure a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood but i guess that s beside the point palmer is determined to get hackman s next project made so he sets out to convince big star martin weir danny devito to star in the movie bringing along down and out horror actress karen flores rene russo who has already had affairs with hackman and devito it doesn t take a las vegas odds maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well after the customary sexual tension and denial which has been used in every comedy from who s the boss to speechless it works in this case unlike who s the boss although it s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman s other films and want in on this one too along with travolta s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction despite the obvious similarities this movie doesn t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i ve seen this year yes even better than halloween vi get shorty is my kind of movie one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence i m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on are you getting this shorty 
a common complaint amongst film critics is why aren t there more literate scripts available quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn t dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content paul attanasio s script takes what could have been a tepid thriller the quiz show scandals of the late s and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors the film is riddled with telling symbols e g a chrysler a radio announcement of sputnik but is never heavy handed deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script redford departs from the usually overlight cable tv quality sets and camera work so common in recent th century period pieces quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years although i was only years old when the twenty one scandal broke enough of the s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford s almost tangible palette from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism of a generation that had gone through years of depression and world war without disposable income before the manifestation of its american dream the film deftly weaves several themes together from assimilation and exclusion of jews from the good life to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father s fame though the s audience that is rocked by this scandal may initially seem naive to us they should appear all too familiar with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day the tv audience is almost a fourth main character always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf at the film s end the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same s tv audience mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret this mirror may reflect an image we re not all that comfortable with 
 in brief this film needs no introduction if you haven t heard of it then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical and if you haven t seen it well i suspect you re in a small minority first thing s first is it all it s hyped up to be well yes and no it s a good film and there s a lot to like about it but it s not without its problems when i saw the first trailer for titanic it was when i went to see bean last summer i think my intial reaction was ain t that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful real life tragedy i mean what s happened to hollywood s script writers have they run entirely out of new ideas gads whatever next i asked myself how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme i was not entirely filled with anticipation but then i wasn t alone in that respect it s when it came out in the cinema to rave reviews well mostly and anyone who d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice i didn t see the film until several months after its release by which time my sister had seen it about four times so i went with a slightly more open mind but i still didn t think i d enjoy it much did i yes and no mainly yes i m happy to say the first hour or so was beautifully done not so much because of the scripting i ll talk about that later but because the re created ship and sets were stunning to look at as was cameron s directing and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the human aspect of the story the romance between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio was enchanting the film is told via flashback with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day you knew that a course well it s an often effective device to use in storytelling though sometimes it can fall flat does it work here in script form it doesn t add all that much to the story what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart whose stunning performance is the strongest most moving of the film her presence brings a much deeper level of passion and depth to the story and though her appearances are relatively brief the film would have suffered without her also impressive are dicaprio and winslet who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving it s an old story you know forbidden love ala romeo and juliet but it works and jack s rescuing rose in both literal and figurative senses and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching in fact i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm energy to the romance it s engaging touching and very enjoyable there s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well simply because you know it s not going to be a happy ending which leads us to the second half of the film we all knew it was coming i m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it because as he s stated in interviews the real thrust of the story for him was the sinking and the jack rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film i think that understates the importance of the romance as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die the iceberg arrives and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour and it is an hour my goodness we don t miss a second of that hour gratuitous well perhaps not by today s standards i m sure there s been far worse produced under the banner of entertainment in other films but i certainly wasn t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be not that i d expect the word understatement to be part of cameron s vocabulary he who brought us such umm vivid films as terminator and aliens is it overdone i thought so understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy no no one expected a happy ending but i didn t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film s second half still whether it was overdone and heavy handed or not if it was the shock factor cameron was after it worked because i was shocked and moved in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears you really couldn t help but get emotionally involved whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack or that jack would rescue rose or that they would both survive perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface the bit where rose lets go of jack s hand while promising she ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart wrenching and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image to put no fine a point on it i loved the ending however which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half so we ve established that the film is powerful and moving if the last hour was rather excessive haven t mentioned the script plot wise it s ok though the jack rose relationship was beautifully developed but i ve a feeling that s to the actors credit if anything as for the dialogue well titanic is set in it s a period drama but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned did they really use phrases like goddamn it back in the turn of the century i doubt it would someone talk like this do ya love the guy or what i doubt it is such dialogue as i saw the iceberg and i see it in your eyes now not just a bit clumsy yes it is a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray and cameron himself is to blame he wrote the script stick with directing dude but its more than redeemed by the acting with dicaprio and winslet on fine form ably supported by a strong cast star of the show was gloria stuart though why didn t she win that oscar after all they were throwing oscars at titanic left right and centre but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee directing wise cameron does a spectacular job like i said his vision was a bit excessive but at least he directed it well i haven t even mentioned james horner s beautiful score utterly heavenly though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it i ve finished my rant which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would just leaves a couple of questions was it worth all those oscars hell don t talk to me about oscars bloomin farce it was deserving in a number of departments though last question is it as some suggest one of the best films of all time nope i don t think so it s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i ve ever seen but i don t think it quite ranks as one of my all time favourites and as for the fact they re reportedly making a titanic well i guess that s typical hollywood for you 
capsule earthy experimental difficult shockingly frank even for and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops the first few minutes of sweet sweetback s baad asssss song yes i checked that s the correct number of ss are without dialogue just eerie montages of sounds a young boy obviously malnourished is taken in and fed up by several loving mother surrogate figures then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation underneath the title credits that s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life something we re not used to seeing on screen this is one tough movie to swallow no matter who you are but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences the plot is simple but not simpleminded sweetback hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man breaks his bonds and runs like hell along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies or at all for that matter the slums the missions the ghetto in other lesser movies sweetback would be machine gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies in this one we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted ssbas first appeared in and was promptly rated x by an all white jury as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns and it s hardly surprising why there s a good deal of sex in the movie but it s handled in a way that s unsettlingly frank a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie in one scene sweetback visits a friend s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there and the other man chats him up while on the toilet we re not used to coming this close to people in real life let alone in the movies especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles hands one scene in which a man is interrogated by the cops is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack another note ssbas is not so much anti white that would be too easy as anti authority and as the movie goes on to demonstrate authority exists in many forms governments churches and even the paranoid inside of one s own mind ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet god knows 
originally entitled dancing about architecture i e talking about love is like dancing about architecture but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box office dud dancing at lughnasa this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names playing interesting and well written characters within a vignettes styled plot arrangement a la robert altman plot follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love finding themselves regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are and who they want and appreciating the fine emotional art of love critique charmingly effective romantic drama this film offers insight into various types of relationships presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties how do people fall in love why do people fall out of love how do people fall back into love once they ve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club all of these questions and more are touched upon in this film within several types of variant relationships meet a hip young couple going through their first date a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships a married woman finding herself while cheating on her husband a husband letting go of his inhibitions an older couple dealing with a past love of the man a secret recently uncovered a son dying from aids joined by his mother at the hospital there are many nuances to this picture and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate but more importantly there is diversity diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels some related to the younger couples issues others with the married there s a little bit of everything for everyone in here and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year i would relate myself to yet another predicament just like love itself this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels the actors in this film are all also very very good sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve as is gena rowlands as the aging wife with trepidations jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance while philippe is as pretty boy as ever anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re ignite her love life opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk show host jon stewart even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached was the part surrounding jay mohr the man dying from aids and his mother ellen burstyn the actors were fine but somehow the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me but i guess that s just hollywood this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors and happiness in concept and style but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care as opposed to this film which offers rich and believable characters living real lives and talking about real issues in today s relationships all in all this movie offers many interesting characters talking and living genuine and engaging love lives wonderful performances by its solid cast too sweet of an ending but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless little known facts about this film and its stars according to a story in the london sunday mirror sean connery asked for only for his role in this movie as compared to his usual fee of million because he liked the script so much on top of that he convinced his co stars including gena rowlands gillian anderson ellen burstyn et al to do the same this is director writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of adult films before this he had written and produced many children s movies gillian anderson stands angelina jolie s full name is angelina jolie voight she is actor jon voight s daughter she has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute she divorced actor jonny lee miller of trainspotting fame in they were married in actor ryan phillippe s full name is matthew ryan phillippe he stands and spent his childhood in new castle delaware his acting career started on tv s one life to live he portrayed daytime television s first gay teenager jon stewart s full name is jonathan stewart leibowitz this film was originally entitled if they only knew and dancing about architecture watch for movie posters from swingers chasing amy and the texas chainsaw massacre at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date 
when casting the key part of the voice of moses most people s first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer the saint and the island of dr moreau but he was dreamworks s choice in their first traditionally animated movie the prince of egypt the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn t in the casting department the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic a la cecil b demille to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies now that is something fresh let me admit up front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off dreamworks s antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz but it is much more satisfying like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar s a bug s life the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices danny glover is the voice of jethro jeff goldblum of aaron steve martin of hotep helen mirren of the queen michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god the movie which is weakest in the story department is a cliff s notes version of demille s the ten commandments the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses s life demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice at less than half of that the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn t establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ralph fiennes the future pharaoh moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew all i ve ever known to be true is a lie moses complains after finding out his real identity he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him after leaving egypt moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses s people go this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand drawn animation of the most of the production it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses blues and golds the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has done with an explicit two dimensional look the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story even though it has its weaknesses the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family this awe inspiring movie deserves to be seen the prince of egypt runs about it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child but those over will probably like it 
the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made i know that is very sweeping statement so i ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of science fiction stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot a space odyssey is probably a better film but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science most all other films we normally classify as science fiction or sf are really just fantasy action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high tech for van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town something bad happens to them pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight apparently everyone in the town is dead the authorities call a wildfire alert summoning four scientists all but one of them somewhat reluctant to a super secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada two of scientists stone and hall fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks their blood turned to powder in their veins some went insane before they died and two of them a baby and an old wino are miraculously still alive they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab where stone pressures the white house to call up a directive an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth like life and mutates as it grows their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet they barely call off the bombing in time but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out this triggers the lab s last ditch defense mechanism an atomic bomb to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw the performances are universally fine with the actors keeping things low key and restrained just like scientists to me the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don t expect this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body s wrist is slashed spilling its powdered blood 
a big surprise to me the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi is such a dumb idea i really had no hope they replaced him just fine not with john goodman he didn t do much of anything but with the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant who s ten this was another of my fears for the film but he s a really good dancer and plays a mean harmonica although he may have been dubbed things that intellectually had bothered me before like no mission from god everyone being richer it not being filmed in chicago gave me no problems at all i m quite pleased that there were less car pile ups because they meant less music and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing there s a few early crashes and then one huge pile up but after that it all stops it s just the music one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him but there s no problems with this the music is all as good as ever tons of great musicians showing up with the exception of johnny lang who can t sing all the musicians do a great job the only real problems i had was the special effects these were superfluous and a waste of money since the film isn t doing very well they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel which i want to see the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide http www geocities com hollywood academy remove no spam to reply drive carefully but recklessly mama child s toy the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise peter o toole 
the farrelly brothers third film after dumb and dumber and kingpin brings together the real life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon some nasty humour a cute dog and a mix of love fate and romance plot high school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom unfortunately for ted he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ouch caught in his zipper and misses the big night thirteen years later ted still can t get mary out of his mind and hires a private detective dillon to find her once found it turns out that mary has more than one suitor and that s when the real fun begins critique likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes some funny looking people and a plot that won t ever put you to sleep having said that i must admit that i did like the farrellys two previous films more than this one but that is saying a lot since i really did love those earlier pics this one is also quite funny but it didn t really blow me away like the others then again maybe my expectations were too high then again maybe i should shut up and write a little more about the film and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking disliking the film continuing where their other pictures left off the farrellys create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities and a simple plot by which to tie them all together this one also includes plenty of toilet humour but also some borderline fun making of the disabled and mentally challenged i must admit that i really wasn t sure whether to laugh at some points or not not a good place to be having said that the scenes that did tear through the audience and yours truly were extremely hilarious and went on for several minutes after the punchline the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie something to do with hair gel on the negative end i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture i found them quite useless unfunny and distracting also i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film s trailer and of course i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful intelligent single women still can t seem to find the right guy see kiss the girls i did really like all of the actors in the film especially ben stiller who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from flirting with disaster i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth and lee evans with his superb faux sympathy british accent funny stuff also make sure that you stay for the credits because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip synched version of build me up buttercup which is really cool overall a cute comedy with a decent premise and a few particularly hilarious scenes little known facts the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script dust to dust into the hands of eddie murphy via murphy s neighbour they only found out about murphy s interest when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night matt dillon is a high school dropout in between acting gigs dillon has branched out into the restaurant business close to home in his native new york he co owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls cameron diaz stands started working as a model at the early age of and loves cats ben stiller s father is jerry stiller he played george costanza s jason alexander father on tv s seinfeld peter farrelly has written a novel entitled outside providence which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin rob moran who plays the cop in this film also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin and the bartender in dumb and dumber he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor correspondant julie moran harland williams who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film also played a state trooper in the farrelly s earlier dumb and dumber and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man

melvin van peebles sweet sweetback s baadasssss song was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before in style content and how it was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was a cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees with its subject matter van peebles a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely by himself because no studio would dare fund such a film he was forced to raise all the money himself the movie ended up costing about part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby van peebles cut costs by hiring non union labor and taking on most of the film s responsibilities himself he wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film as well as starred in the central role he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck for instance when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x rating van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed a little marketing scheme he coined the phrases rated x by an all white jury which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film he also printed the phrase on tee shirts which he had no problem selling the storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple it takes place in los angeles and van peebles stars as the title character a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel and makes money by doing what he does best having sex one day he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they re bringing in suspects on a politically charged case involving murder however on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu mu hubert scales who they proceed to beat viciously acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film this plot allows van peebles camera to roam the darker side of l a the ghettos alleys and back street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked van peebles entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored at the beginning of sweet sweetback he offers this epigraph which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented but a hymn from the mouth of reality van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality not of exaggeration of course with today s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner city life as well as films by spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback doesn t seem all that revolutionary it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made at that time sweet sweetback was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it distributors were petrified of a film that in van peebles words gave the black audience a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking ass of course once it caught on it caught on big sweet sweetback is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft and the mack because those were financed by big hollywood studios sweet sweetback is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers however even if when viewed from an african american perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without its controversies when it was first released an article was published in ebony magazine denouncing the film while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film he has no political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs but in personal and selfish motives still others point to the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm nevertheless a movie like sweet sweetback cannot be made without conflicting points of view it is a revolutionary movie not because it s about one man s defiance but because it put front and center black issues that had never been dealt with before until that point american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain and with the exception of sidney poitier all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites the fact that sweet sweetback was a movie by black about blacks was something new in the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors as simply the black community van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before it when the movie first opened he saw it in a theater next to an older woman near the end of the film when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying to herself oh lord let him die don t let them kill him let him die on his own it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african american in a movie who rebelled against white authority that she couldn t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape and of course sweetback does escape and the screen fills with the message watch out a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues beyond the political aspects sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture which van peebles always intended it to be he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced a film that although dated now was technically fantastic at the time he shot in rough documentary like fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him he makes good use of older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment watching sweet sweetback more than twenty five years after its initial release one realizes that it still has bite arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected in this film but there is more to the film than its racial aspect the legacy of sweet sweetback s baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african american perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him 
most sequels don t do what they re supposed to do like toy story does far too many of them end up re hashing the original and adding very little is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors thankfully toy story is a wonderful exception i can t remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one it s yet another sign that pixar the acclaimed animation studio behind toy story and a bug s life is still at the top of its game woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the hit toy story and things have changed a bit since the last one ended woody voiced by tom hanks is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp in his absence he has assigned buzz lightyear tim allen now comfortable in his role as a toy to take charge unfortunately woody s trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale and is stolen by an over zealous toy collector wayne knight off to save him are buzz and members of the old toy gang including mr potato head don rickles rex the nervous dinosaur wallace shawn hamm the piggy bank john ratzenberger and slinky dog jim varney while in captivity woody makes a startling discovery he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a s children s show entitled woody s roundup he meets the show s other characters which include jesse joan cusack his cowgirl sidekick the wise old prospector kelsey grammer and bullseye his trusty horse they have all been anxiously awaiting woody s arrival as once their set is completed they will be sold to a japanese toy museum and finally escape storage forever this means woody now faces a difficult choice with his friends coming to rescue him does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever as in the original film toy story contains first rate animation and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there reportedly the film was originally slated for a direct to video release but after seeing the improvements that had been made disney rightly decided to release it into theaters the film is well worth seeing on the big screen the colors are bright the textures sharp and even the human characters look more human the animation is consistently seamless with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable there are so many impressive sequences that i d find it impossible to list them here but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al s toy barn the store owned by woody s captor pixar s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it the voice work is also perfectly complementary and as with the first movie does much to help further character development tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz making you forget who is doing the voice it was woody and buzz up there not tom and tim all the cast members from the original reprise their roles and each is excellent several new voices have been added with joan cusack kelsey grammer and wayne knight doing fine work toy story is strong in characterization and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie woody faces difficult choices while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn t yet realized his status as a toy forcing him to see what he used to be like the new characters are also developed quite well especially jesse who narrates a sarah mclachlan aided flashback illustrating how she was loved then forgotten by her owner it may be computer animated and it may have sappy music but it s downright touching the script despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers is endlessly clever and inventive especially considering that it s a sequel the reason toy story works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original s success by re doing the same story and using the same characters not this one we get character change new characters and new issues brought up toy story is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here the humor is sharp and witty with something to amuse both kids and adults there are funny asides to films such as star wars and jurassic park among others new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock em sock em robots and appearances from other pixar efforts a bug s life and the short geri s game geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody s broken arm the action is fast and furious and the chases in the street in a toy store in an elevator on a baggage carousel and in an airplane keep getting bigger and better toy story never grows stagnant because there is always something new to hold your interest the more you pay attention to it the more rewarding it is it s rare to see a film like toy story come along because it s the kind of film that s almost impossible to dislike it s created purely to entertain and though i enjoy a thought provoking drama as much as the next person it s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do send us out with a smile it s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing toy story it s the rare sequel that manages to expand on and live up to the original 
star wars episode the phantom menace review by matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas classic star wars the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more americans today can explain what the force or a jedi is than a budget deficit or a serb so years after the release of the original and years since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons against this challenge the fourth star wars film episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week and despite some early critical reviews in the major media the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is a worthy sequel er prequel to the original star wars films the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films as the film opens obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars is only a young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor qui gon jinn liam neeson the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations but in the middle of a planetary invasion rushing to protect naboo s young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice on tatooine qui gon discovers a young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts qui gon senses the child is unusually strong with the force and begins to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being a galactic savior the innocent looking year old will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out a lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sounds a bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knights anakin s turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story moves quickly with the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode one of the reasons the film s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused it s unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movies were clearly luke s story with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight but it s unclear whether this new film is anakin s story or obi wan s if this trilogy is centered on anakin it s a shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers and as a result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little boy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that qui gon is willing to believe he is the one the rest of the cast does fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight mcgregor is well cast as obi wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fits the role of a young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters but the interaction between them individually the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesn t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another in star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obi wan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other individually they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging many of the wonderful elements of lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaur sized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers on venetian looking planet of naboo watch a spectacular event part roman chariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings he creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines most of the new special effects in his re released special edition trilogy in were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren t possible when the films were made more than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures robots with personalities and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters the best such character is watto a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room of all the computer generated characters in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computer generated characters no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks with more than minutes of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include a fully computer generated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon s accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs a comic relief role in the film lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors however despite the technological magic that makes his character possible jar jar isn t completely convincing he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends a roger rabbit like presence you accept that he s there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially i found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film on my second viewing of the film jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn t mind him at all a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the film s struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about one s destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasn t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar to a one man two headed announcer team calling the action at the film s thrilling pod race sequence to a cameo appearance by e t in the film the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun with lots of half hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace works because as in all his films there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning to end there are light saber battles hair raising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil the pod race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film and the final showdown between obi wan qui gon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed the phantom menace won t win any major oscars it probably won t beat titanic s box office record and it s not even the best star wars film i d put it third after the original and the empire strikes back but it s an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film can t live up to it s hype no film not even the original star wars could have done that but it s still worth seeing probably more than once 
i can sum up first strike in one word awesome never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he s ever appeared in he should be awarded greatly the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan s rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well however first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three for the simple reason that practice makes perfect his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great like rumble this film is about the mafia the former kgb now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men the trailer for the film sums it up quite well first strike is action packed but the fight scenes are so fast and furious they almost have a witty italian like humor to them jackie chan is a regular comedian well he s no eddie murphy but he can really crack you up for example he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him as he claims to be the korean that s secret agent james bond even the plot to this film improved above the others as a sort of twisted nuclear weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame but never fear as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident with some of the most high flying stunts and side splitting comedy first strike is a sure fire hit that s guaranteed to draw some major world wide attention 
 love is the devil is a challenging film munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist s psyche rather than the artist s lifeline watching it i was enthralled with the look of the film the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre personalized filter everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon the film s subject looked at it personally but while i was engrossed i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film awakened from my trance by some inner distraction and began to try and follow what s going on exactly what was i looking at watching this film i wasn t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous directed and written by john maybury love is the devil is stylish masterpiece for the senses everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing the camera angles are ferociously askew and the close ups are uncomfortably too close the editing is deft occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs or rather intruders to bacon s world and psyche as such there is no real story i ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn t read prior to the film but what i learned was this he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the s and s drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like he was one of the first to really come out of the closet and in interviews he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi he s like a foppish and self absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero he lives life the way he wants to live it to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him it s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself champagne for my real friends and pain for my sham friends he says one night at the bar he frequents love is the devil chronicles the latter part of his life bacon well known in his mid life awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor he walks in unafraid of what he finds and discovers a thief george dyer daniel craig bacon gives him an offer if he spends the night with him he can take anything he wants in the morning george agrees to this and off to bed he goes but ends up staying with him for whatever reason the film shows their lives together at least in reference to one another while creating bacon s world of friends like high art this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant bacon is haughty and bizarre george is simple and doesn t understand bacon in the least especially not his paintings while watching this that s basically all i thought was there the film has a hypnotic feel free of any restraints of form and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about once the film is over it s easier to piece it together i kept on thinking about this film wondering what the point to all of it was someone doesn t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all and if they do they do it by accident but still allow some substance to creep in thinking about it i remembered how the two fed off of eachother i thought about how bacon was a masochist in love with cruelty in one scene he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer s head splashes across his face in another scene he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein s battleship potemkin and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain he drove him over the edge and for him that was love even if it wasn t for george i guess that explains the title a bit that s great and all but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning i wish it hadn t reduced itself to making some point about humanity about how love is the most selfish thing in the world and it is if you look at it a certain way or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man s twisted pysche it s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience s throat that way you don t reduce your film to something it s just not i can t say i totally enjoyed love is the devil though despite all of the things i respect about this movie it s still rather uncomfortable to sit through even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through especially after an exhausting first hour though hypnotic it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times as if it were taking advantage of one man s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it as such i respect the way the film looks it s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that along with what dreams may come and dark city it s the year s most visually stunning film in fact if a better script had been forged i d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance then i would have had something to hold me over even now 
jonathan demme s beloved based on the book toni morrison is a study in skillful literary adaptation on the one hand the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel evoking morrison s pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice on the other hand beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story s main events this choice is a smartly made one for it creates an open space in which the story s wide range of emotions can gestate and grow indeed the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled beloved takes place in the second half of the th century during the so called reconstruction era after the civil war for newly freed slaves it is a time of confusion and turmoil oprah winfrey is sethe a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse where she hoped the terror would end what she did not know was that it would follow her there and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished beloved ultimately tells the story of sethe s search for forgiveness one long hampered by an unforgettable sin the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe s escape as a violent unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse invisible hands terrorize her family flinging objects across rooms shaking tables rattling floorboards sethe s sons run away perhaps for good leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves demme s matter of fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of beloved s intriguing aspects all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real when paul d danny glover a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost s hellish visions he doesn t run in terror instead he asks who the ghost is as in morrison s novel demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created sethe is the one being haunted but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears in fact the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved thandie newton a young black clad woman who appears on sethe s front lawn leaned christ like against a tree stump sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health they know not who she is but that doesn t matter only paul d is suspicious of the stranger little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years winfrey is arguably beloved s greatest asset she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d as is kimberly elise as denver sethe s wanderlusting daughter as sethe s sage like mother in law old baby suggs beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears the film s least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself thandie newton plays the glassy eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first but which becomes off putting and unintentionally laughable by the end departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as the silence of the lambs and melvin howard director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison s novel totemic camera shots and color saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme s films but the few he uses here work to the film s benefit beloved s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs gatherings in a forest clearing where the bright yellow greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs words do for the most part though demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality this combined with morrison s equally frugal method of storytelling may make beloved somewhat of a challenge to watch even to those familiar with the book though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film nothing is spoon fed to the viewer morrison s novel is just as enigmatic but unlike a movie a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb the movie begins like poltergeist and ends like the color purple with shades of the scarlet letter and little women somewhere in the middle taken as a whole beloved is a disquieting one of a kind experience one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance 
when i first saw the previews for ron howard s latest film my expectations were discouragingly low a show about nothing sounds like seinfeld a guy whose entire life is broadcast hours a day sounds like the truman show what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants another puts one out about bugs which is why i was pleasantly surprised by edtv which turns out to be a fresh insightful and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity the writing by howard s longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus in the hands of a less experienced director edtv could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday s meatloaf with their true tv cable ratings being threatened by the gardening channel apparently people would rather watch soil the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers program director cynthia topping ellen degeneres comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment the hook is to find a regular guy someone normal that people can relate to while scouting possible candidates cynthia s camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray woody harrelson in a bar where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame but on watching the videotape the show s producers are more taken with ed than with ray he s cute he says all the wrong things and he s usda hick cynthia s boss played by rob reiner gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it s tough going in the early stages the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth action shot wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster you get the idea but soon enough things nielsen boosting kinds of things start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the true tv cameras are right there to document it ed s privacy is no longer his own his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media who should ed go out with you can be sure the pollsters have a list not only is the film exceedingly well cast but its performers are consistently excellent matthew mcconaughey provides the face the body language and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america s latest phenomenon he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed s mother and martin landau is one of the film s highlights as al ed s ailing stepfather jenna elfman from tv s dharma and greg proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting even degeneres and reiner are better than you d expect in writer director comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called real life in which a small time opportunist makes a real time documentary about a typical american family the scenes of ed s family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big budget variant on that film paralleling its wickedly inventive humor as with most films by albert brooks real life was funny but absurd the funniest and scariest thing about edtv is that it is absolutely believable 
seen july at the crossgates cinema albany ny theater at p m with my mom using hoyts cinema cash theater rating very good sound picture and seats it s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters lives but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do therefore gone with the wind deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does in such a crafted intricate and entertaining manner it s a crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself the film takes place in georgia before during and after the civil war this plays a major factor in the film s success to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy it might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers can a story set so long ago be relatable now the film confronts all these problems paradoxically by not cronfronting them it doesn t simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media without which what is there to build on we re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters especially our main character scarlett o hara leigh a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel a cunning wit and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time she knows how her society works wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be being the most sought after woman allows her to manipulate men and their women to ensure she gets her way whether it be obvious i e who will be the one to get her food or subtle i e getting married just to spite someone the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes howard a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him he isn t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett in fact he s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his her name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable characters one will ever see she and scarlett become very dear friends but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her and the love she has for her husband her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but doesn t give her much emotional self defense acting a catalyst to the love triangle and to the story as a whole is the daper stong willed cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable he s quite a character all right everyone listens to what he has to say even though he s got a bad reputation butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior he tells everyone the much needed truth in the rigid caste like society where freewill doesn t seem to exist everything is done out of honor and tradition for example in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out this angers them not for his lack of faith but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that do we have ammunition factories do we have food do we have a navy all we have is tobacco all true statements and yet the south still insists he s wrong butler is a shifty character to be sure but he takes such pride in his arrogance it s appealing scarlett notices this too when she first sees him and from the look butler gives her we know he s not going to stop until he has her but scarlett can t get past her need for ashley and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever and so the story goes on with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dies this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story some are vital for only a few scenes but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film in most films only a few characters exist for support in background but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside real world but these types of simple approaches are never taken the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming no not my leg don t cut off my leg another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street but as the camera pulls back we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers but it is their moaning that s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be as the second half begins the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north she manages to resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she has can t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south s ultimate defeat this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett each uses the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can t help but want her more every time she tries to one up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business they say opposites attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities it borders on magnetic polarization they need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together perhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaves it up to us to make this call both have things the other wants and vice versa but when they compromise is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film we re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why gable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture all none either way is possible and it s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings it s safe to say most of us won t live such overly dramatic lives as those in gone with the wind but it s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we ve just experienced a life s worth of joy and pain 
having not seen who framed roger rabbit in over years and not remembering much besides that i liked it then i decided to rent it recently watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is aside from the fact that it s a milestone in animation in movies it s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters have them interact and make it convincingly real and a great entertainment it s also quite an effective comedy mystery while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original especially baby herman and watching them together is a lot of fun the story begins in hollywood in cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work so hard boiled private detective eddie valiant bob hoskins is called in by studio head r k maroon alan tilvern to try to help get roger s mind back on work maroon thinks that roger s wife jessica s possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots valiant takes some photos of jessica playing patty cake with marvin acme stubby kaye the owner of toontown where all of the cartoon characters live and takes them to maroon upon seeing them roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town and eventually toontown trying to clear roger s good name along the way they meet judge doom christopher lloyd a judge jury and executioner type who s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a toon who framed roger rabbit won academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production which included hundreds of animators also bob hoskins performance should be credited he in addition to the rest of the human cast finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co stars according to the internet movie database hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off who framed roger rabbit is a rare film one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom do yourself a favor and rent it p p p p please 
you may not have heard of lucas or if you have you might not think much of it probably because it stars corey haim or maybe because it s about a little geek who collects insects or maybe because it doesn t feature slick one liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the s however you have been missing out on a true masterpeice the best film of and the best film about adolescent life ever made corey haim stars as lucas bligh a tiny year old with scruffy hair thick glasses and an interest in insects and other outdoor life one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him her name is maggie a year old who certainly is a beauty with lovely red hair and a sweet innocent complexion maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her but somehow he interests her and soon they are talking and getting to know one another they gradually become good friends and spend the summer together doing various things such as studying insects namely locusts who come out of hiding once every years playing tennis and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover lucas is obviously in love with maggie and while she is charmed by him it s clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend this is not clear to lucas however he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what s about to happen we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally they throw him on stage right in front of his beloved maggie surprisingly he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around but he takes it too far and is embarassed in front of the entire school the next scene is brilliant maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened he rails back against her in a cruel unfair fashion in lesser movies this would ve turned into a confrontation between the two characters but maggie is written smarter than that she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him next we are introduced to another great character named cappie charlie sheen he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend what s interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks of course anyone with a brain can tell what s gonna happen next cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas relationship this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone she s been assigned to show him how to operate the washer dryer so he can clean his shirt maggie is charmed by cappie s tender undertsanding demeanor not to mention his shirtless body this scene is so delicate and sweet but cappie still has a girlfriend preventing either one from acting on their desires desperately trying to puncture the tension cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room it s not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend in the films only subpar scene lucas finally figures out what s going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself such as try out for the football team the last third of the film revolves around this attempt while the idea seems cliched the way it is executed is not there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up dave grusin s memorable score played at the perfect moments certainly helps lucas is filled with great performances forget everything you know about corey haim back in he had talent and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully dimensional performance filled with anger humor and pain kerri green is very appealing as maggie showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her sheen s cappie is almost too good to be true but sheen makes him beleivable especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti s ben a friend of lucas whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina the girl who admires lucas from afar when people talk about the great teen angst films of the s you hear john hughes this and john hughes that lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so called classics but hopefully like with heathers and say anything lucas can begin to find it s own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald it deserves more than that but i don t want to be greedy 
i ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges but i loved him in the big lebowski the part of jeff the dude lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind and the fit is perfect the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians he s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy but not before they urinate on his rug the dude assumes that these collection agents were after another jeff lebowski a famous millionaire who also lives in l a so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug the millionaire refuses but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped he wants the dude to act as go between for the kidnapers dude and his friend walter john goodman take on the task and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers millionaires high schoolers nihilists artists pornographers thugs and league bowlers comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres so take my recommendation as you will for me the big lebowski is very funny it is an incredibly successful comedy the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films not only are the two leads bridges and goodman funny separately and together but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure all the characters end up as the butt of jokes but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived each person may be a comic caricature but there is always a respectful self acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension the characters are firmly established and they never change their behavior for a quick cheap laugh it s not what they do that s funny it s who they are which is why the acting is so important and so successful in this movie worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus that s jee zus not hay soos the greaser bowler who s in a lusty marriage with the game julianne moore as the post post feminist artist whose work has been described as vaginal steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter and sam elliott as the rambling long winded narrator aside from the performances what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue people lose trains of thought they interrupt they boast they repeat themselves they repeat their friends they sound natural taken with fargo the coen brothers last film it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers ethan coen is not just good at directing actors he s also good at technical directing he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film perhaps beautiful is the wrong word nihilists carpet pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty but the bowling photography and a series of viking bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film all around the big lebowski is great solid comedy outstanding acting writing direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success 
the s produced two brilliant science fiction films one was gattaca the other was the thirteenth floor just as gattaca was overshadowed by the mighty titanic the thirteenth floor was relegated to obscurity by the matrix however the thirteeth floor though it deals with similar themes is a much better movie than the frenetic childish and improbable matrix a cutting edge computer scientist hannon fuller played by the charming armin mueller stahl is murdered his associate douglas hall craig bierko apparently framed and suspected by the police enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery along the way a beautiful blonde gretchen mol more bodies and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture the thirteenth floor unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view first its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline second and more seriously it demands that its audience think and feel no wonder it fell through the cracks done in film noir style as a murder mystery this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels many audiences will simply be bewildered by it rather than engaged which is a shame because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie despite its philosophical challenges the thirteenth floor derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller mol and douglas hall bierko as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller in that sense it is more akin to gattaca than the matrix which for all of its cute philosophical byplay is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying wrenching and intellectually challenging in its final moments the film even takes on itself when david jane s husband who has come to enjoy killing accuses her of being the sick one although there is a victory for the leading characters this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane and thus a deep seated character flaw in fact hannon fuller s activities in the simulated world the behavior of jane s husband and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil the tragedy is not in their stars but in themselves the major actors all of whom are required to play two or even three roles perform extremely well bierko who will be familiar as the psycho from the long kiss goodnight is outstanding d onofrio as whitney who plays a pivotal role in support also turns in a good performance the lovely gretchen mol whose elegance integrity and determination suggest bergman in casablanca does a wonderful job her voice however lacks the necessary weight at times this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script some minor flaws hairline cracks in fine porcelain appear in places there are one or two instances of jerky editing the script takes the edge off the film s climaxes the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times yet there is a clue there too one wonders if even after two decades blade runner is still casting its long shadow over sci fi films one can see a group of suits in their suite waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in amadeus make it more like blade runner you know dark and rainy the thirteen floor is that rare exception among hollywood movies a rich emotionally satisfying intelligent sci fi movie and yet ultimately it proves the suits right for when good sci fi is made where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it if we don t support great sf who will

james l brooks one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news returns to the big screen with this entertaining if slightly flawed comedy nicholson plays melvin udall probably the most horrible person ever on the screen he s racist homophobic and never has a good word to say to anyone so nobody talks to him except waitress carol conelly t v sitcom star hunt who was last seen in twister naturally udall conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop kinnear who nicholson hates all hit it off in the end like good will hunting and titanic even though the outcome is completely obvious as good as it gets is an enjoyable funny and warm comedy nicholson is hilarious as melvin churning out insults with superb relish only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers hunt is also good as waitress carol and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson there s also thankfully a bit of chemistry between them kinnear as the gay neighbor seems to have a slightly underwritten role he s more of a plot convience than a character although his performance is good his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together in fact the scene stealer is simon s dog who is funnier than nicholson but then again pets are always cute on screen providing solid support is cuba gooding jnr jerry maguire and yeardly smith who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons although gooding isn t as good as is character in maguire he is still fun he overacts a little but not so much as to be annoying smith is also good although she has a fairly small role even director lawrence kasdan body heat makes an appearance as a doctor but this is primarily nicholsons film and every scene he s in he s steals it he s character is so hateful though it s amazing that anyone talks to him at all especially carol and this is the films main problem it s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin she doesn t fall in love with him naturally the film forces her to fall in love with him also melvins character seems to go too nice too quickly i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice loving person it would take a helluva long time much longer than this film would like to make out brooks direction is good though if a bit average but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones he tends to pile on to much schmaltz but generally he s good there s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer but generally as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie the movie is a bit overlong but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly overall as good as it gets is a fun movie even though it may be unbelivable and certainly worth seeing if just for jack nicholsons performance not quite as good as it gets pardon the bad joke but still good fun 
the computer animated comedy shrek is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups for children it offers imaginative visuals appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces loads of action and a barrage of big laughs including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances apparently a requisite in contemporary family films for adults it s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids all in all shrek is a snappy ride although there are a couple of points i found disturbing but first the basics based very loosely on a children s story shrek follows several momentous days in the life of the title character a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp until a local nobleman disturbs his peace petty tyrant lord farquaad take away the awk in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one liners owns the land on which shrek resides he proceeds to turn the ogre s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle as a result shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice pinocchio the big bad wolf the seven dwarfs and the three bears to name but a few an enraged shrek storms to the castle only to find farquaad john lithgow ready to bargain lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from snow white has shown him the way all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of the dating game when snow white is shown the cheeky announcer purrs even though she lives with seven men she s not easy farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona cameron diaz and offers shrek a deal if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon protected lava moat filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest accompanied by a motor mouthed donkey eddie murphy determined to make the green grump his best friend they finally hook up with the princess only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet for the matter the dragon offers a few surprises as well the movie references a great many other flicks from babe that ll do donkey that ll do to the graduate but the lion s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney the public domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits pinocchio is referred to as a possessed toy and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin he bellows get that dead broad off the table but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad s royal domicile which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like it s a small world which brings me to disturbing point number one i laughed at all the disney swipes but found the mentality behind them a bit sad the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer here s a suggestion for the two boys grow up put the past behind you there s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can t play nice then go to your rooms the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad beyond all the irreverence shrek actually has a message people should learn to look beyond physical appearances because true beauty lies within it s a lovely notion but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad s diminutive stature do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable the pompous selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers adding short jokes is simply mean still shrek is a rollicking good time the computer animation is mostly impressive although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky the voice work is strong particularly from eddie murphy the laughs come fast and furious and the moral tainted though it may be is a good one to trot out a clich shrek is fun for all ages parents though should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short tall skinny fat etc is a bad thing 
capsule the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi day festivities mira nair s film is pleasant enough with a little human drama a few family secrets some sadness and some happiness you have seen it all before but perhaps not from india the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable low to mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala her newest film written by sabrina dhawan is very similar to previous films like betsy s wedding but it is set in new delhi a wealthy family is having a wedding an indian wedding is a multi day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial even more than in the us it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get together the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members individual story lines aditi verma is marrying hemant an indian engineer working in the us she had previously had a relationship with vikram her supervisor latit her father played by naseeruddin shah is juggling many problems not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice one of the family servants several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex family secrets or both there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna on the other hand it was not clear to me at least if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english the latter will however help with an international release sabrina dhawan s screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog we have seen films with plotting very much like this but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life i rate it a on the to scale and a low on the to scale 
to me nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence ever since the big success of the action thriller face off in the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr cage the perpetually awful assassination thriller snake eyes was one of s worst films mm was a disappointing lost cause but who better than scorsese to match cage s wit and intensity which he does in miraculous fashion with bringing out the dead cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day to day after five years of the stress inducing job frank basically just staggers onward relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care namely a young girl named rose who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york frank desperately wants to be fired but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need i ll fire you tomorrow he promises frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance the first is larry john goodman who always has food on the brain the second is marcus ving rhames a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation and finally tom tom sizemore is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank but they never figured into the actual plot each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank s character because bringing out the dead is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary patricia arquette the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack arquette who recently received the wounds of christ in stigmata performs well around real life husband cage it s unfortunate that after such intriguing character trials and tribulations the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled ineffective finale the movie belongs to the one two punch of cage and scorsese who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to bringing out the dead although it certainly lacks the grit and hard edge of something like goodfellas scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture the incredible camera work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with s kundun does bringing out the dead rival scorsese s finest work only occasionally some of the film feels surprisingly limp but there is enough energy in it s interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice those expecting a grisly risqu product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight arrow approach but it s still a solid admirable effort bringing out the dead was written by the acclaimed paul schrader who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as taxi driver and raging bull schrader s script is full of moments wonderful sharply defined moments that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay the exceptional aspects of the film are it s astounding technical credits and the amazing cast goodman and sizemore are both electric well mainly sizemore but it s the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look watch the actor s deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member and you ll understand why he won a golden globe bringing out the dead is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it s certain flaws scorsese and cage for that matter have done better but their intentions are certainly admirable 
he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother she inspires his love and his fear and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus he has a rudimentary grasp of language mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother s phrases he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door he is years old in body but a child in mind and spirit he is the premise for bad boy bubby a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby nicholas hope who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment etc etc then one day his father ralph cotterill appears his father is a shabby down at heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion unsurprisingly he is not thrilled with the way his boy has turned out he is however rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother claire benito and more to the point her ample breasts soon they are copulating on the dingy couch while bubby crouches confused in the next room acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest bubby s relationship to the world may be warped but it is at least stable the father s arrival disturbs his precarious balance causing an oedipal conflict which ends freud would be pleased in violence and as a result freedom bubby intuits from his father s arrival that the air outside is breathable he leaves the apartment his past his world behind so far so good the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby which bring us to this point are quite brilliant the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby s hermetic two room universe it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise bubby is used by his mother for sex he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins it is grim and savage and appalling but also strangely tender de heer having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby s does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes but simply empathizes he observes what it might be like the intensity of these opening scenes with their minimalist mise en scene immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world and owes much to david lynch s eraserhead not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack for thirty minutes the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own then de heer lets bubby out brings him into contact with our world and the film never quite recovers our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide where he wanders the streets and meets people where he suffers and learns and survives he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band how an anti social half wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages wisely he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group he is imprisoned and raped he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension he is loved by a motherly large breasted nurse carmel johnson it goes on by turns inventive silly tasteless endearing and sometimes all of these things at once de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world the tone shifts uneasily from fable to realism to satire and back again the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest the film is best understood as a kind of parable and indeed the religious implications of bubby s experiences are foregrounded icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother s walls bubby dons a priest s collar stolen from his father a church organ playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief the woman who redeems him is named angel the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby s mind do not fragment him into psychosis rather the world accomodates him and heals him although de heer s touch is at times overbearing bubby s salvation is touching what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ve humanist tale of improbable hope a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art and turning the band into a popular draw innocence triumphs bubby becomes a holy fool an idiot savant and graces us with wisdom it s a strange turn of events but by now we shouldn t be surprised because bad boy bubby ain t like other movies 
 run lola run a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance for a berserk and retroactive minutes of non stop movement we follow a fiery haired heroine named lola franka potente as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve marks in time to save manni moritz bleibtreu from being killed by the dealer but in something of a pseudo groundhog day approach director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal in these trio of episodes we gradually learn the unique effects of fate for even if tiny changes are made in lola s journey the future can be seriously altered run lola run is an experience like fight club or the matrix in that each film takes you through a super charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways in addition all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack lola is no exception with stylish quick flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get go tykwer s world is a landscape of mood and color with brilliant shades of red and pink including lola s fiery hair used as effective symbolism throughout with it s visual style and mind blowing pace run lola run is one of the more invigorating movies of the year even more so when considering the fact it s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an minute time period as a heroine potente does little more than run wildly through the streets as the title suggests but she has a certain flair and charisma her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star meanwhile bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life both actors perform beyond the call of duty the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola and the outcome is ultimately rewarding several twists and turns are unique and unexpected the other characters lola runs into both purposely and inadvertently include her banker father herbert kraup and a friendly security guard armin rohde but aside from the two leads no one has more than a few minutes of screen time additional stars that couldn t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy who are both responsible for the film s eye catching visual elegance run lola run is subtitled so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning fast dialogue occasional sections of it are especially fast this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation most are just chess pieces in tykwer s elaborate game of visual presentation and he never really makes a significant move with any but the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay a few petty gripes aside this film is a wild exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality most people believe foreign films are mainly boring talky character studies perhaps run lola run will recharge their batteries not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny it also delivers a white knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character run lola run is exhausting 
the postman delivers but not first class the postman a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman warning my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons post apocalypse stories hope in a desperate situation grassroots uprisings and kevin costner even worse i thought that waterworld was watchable read the following with those particular grains of salt it s the year and things have fallen apart due to a world war in the late nineties the resulting three year winter and a devastating plague life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms although this is the future it looks like a western as the film opens kevin costner his character s name is never revealed is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders running into even worse luck he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem will patton the rag tag retro futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the clan after a brutal boot camp he and you can see this coming a mile away escapes taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either once he reaches oregon land of beautiful women bright youngsters and rock and roll he pretends to be a representative from the restored congress of the united states of america this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby olivia williams who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman as costner is referred to for the rest of the film become a reluctant item although the postman knows he s running a fraud the concept of renewed communications sets the kids imagination afire especially ford lincoln mercury larenz tate his second in command and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists tyranny the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner although the movie appeals to my sensibilities there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted it s derivitive of costner s own waterworld and clint eastwood westerns there s little here that we haven t seen dozens of times before the film is often down right corny a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright eyed child is embarrassing in its slow motion banality the film s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor despite the film s excessive three hour length several things are never explained what was the war about how did civilization change so rapidly everyone has horses where did all they come from the law of eights that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film but where are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn t made their way west to help or conquer there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn t appear to make sense the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments but beyond that there are some oddities the evil army is called holnists which sounds coincidentally like the new age holism but why is it another coincidence that it takes place in just one year after many ancient prophesies including the ending of the mayan calendar predict a new world for mankind why is the general named bethlehem there seems to be some reason for that but what sometimes the movie feels like a joke an army of postal workers armed with guns considering the headlines of recent years it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys it s even more difficult to accept those re powering the federal government as the heroes given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government it s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film s nationalism even with its numerous flaws the movie all comes together if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have it s doubtful that the postman is going to find much of an audience but a few of us are going to have a good time besides we re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year millennium computer bug michael redman has written this column for over years and would like to announce that the michael redman arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is to the best of his knowledge not him perhaps this similarly named person should have used kevin costner s postal service 
billed as a feminist sex fantasy this spirited imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award winning canadian director cynthia roberts is destined for extreme reactions camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart felt tale of the title character bubbles galore nina hartley a porn actress turned porn producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence however those in the andrea dworkin camp will no doubt loathe the film s decidedly pro porn stance political considerations aside however this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers shauny sexton in the backdrop however is bubbles loyal assistant vivian klitorsky tracy wright who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss this femme butch femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity and sensuality in addition to the romantic aspects of the story bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex boyfriend godfrey montana daniel macivor a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence god herself yes in the world of this film god is most definitely a her and a chorus of undulating scantily clad angels have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction this bright colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock full of great performances making her dramatic debut after appearing in over triple x adult films porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary straight actresses to shame hartley has overwhelming star power and one wonders why other non triple x producers haven t used her bountiful talents it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of boogie nights a film which takes a far more traditional doom and gloom approach to the porn industry making a cameo appearance in the role of god former porn actress annie sprinkle a true artist in her own right gives the entire film an earthy sensual glow and certainly solidifies and by her very appearance downright justifies the themes of the movie the other performances are equally solid daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role shauny sexton an erotic dancer and pin up model makes an impressive screen debut overall bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed at one point the title character declares that instead of trying to save women from the sex trade we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant garde montage sequences the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish s porn and psychedelia amazingly this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture as one cannot imagine such an entertaining original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not at present appear to have any traditional distribution in place so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one it s funny sexy and subversive and it shouldn t be missed 
if there s one thing in common about all of hollywood s major studios it s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively it s obvious there s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater so when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production it s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no thought movie quite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen the story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statement making in the cinema not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite a bit of luck find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named pleasantville maguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudo world but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the father knows best times it s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in a quite unlikely way what life is really like soon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness at one end is a soda shop owner turned painter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is a close minded mayor j t walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town fine performances are turned in all around maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j t walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance daniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman s envy for daniels it s his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh it s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish there s not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don t 
every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre with dramas it was citizen kane with arthouse it was pulp fiction and with comedy it was well that jim carrey guy okay so he s not a movie but he did have a huge influence on the genre not to mention an expensive one sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big sprawling motion picture event as did forrest gump four years ago with action films it was aliens whic was released to much hype seven years after it s equally innovative parent alien directed and written by james cameron t judgement day the abyss true lies the authority on action films it was a masterful encore to his sci fi thriller the terminator while the original alien film was a dark enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew james cameron took the big budget action film with aliens which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing although on a much larger scale and boy did he take that route i d say at about mph or so the film opens years after the original with lt ripley weaver being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel if you ll recall at the end of alien ripley the only surviving member cryogenically hibernated herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship unfortunately she thought she d only be out for a couple of weeks once she s returned to earth ripley is quickly interrogated by the company who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy in truth they believe her as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an alien advisor it seems that the colony planet was a once breeding ground for the nasty aliens and now all communication with the planet has been lost it doesn t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next ripley agrees and before you can say big mistake she and the half dozen marines plus the slimy corporate guy reiser who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve are off to the colony when they arrive they find the planet in ruins only one survivor is found a little girl newt who confirms that yes the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system and soon enough the marines come under attack from the aliens what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci fi movie the action scenes cameron directs them so skillfully and so suspensefully that you re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around which features in my opinion the best fight scene ever recorded on film as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death many people will tell you that this film while being a great action film has no real drama and is all cliches well they would be wrong my friends if this film had no drama then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the academy awards that s right best actress you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f x has got to be good in short aliens combines all the right elements great action and f x drama a good plot good dialogue and great villains into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time then again maybe not movies rise and fall from glory and sad to say aliens was wrestled from it s throne of best action movie by another cameron film t judgement day in so who will be the next king well let s wait until december th and see yet another james cameron film the highest budgeted film of all time titanic to make that decision i can t wait 
if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton chop sideburns to each side of his head spoken with a thick irish accent and tried his damnedest to play it straight he wouldn t have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in i went down gleeson who s not dissimilar to the late saturday night live alumnus in terms of physical attributes plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film bunny is sent to county cork to retrieve one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle bunny is to accompany git hynes peter mcdonald recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies that tom french is a mean bollocks he wants frank back and a small matter of some that tom s wife was supposed to have given to frank for this he won t break anyone s thumbs maybe inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach i went down follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs dimly lit pubs and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity the butcher boy even if you can t comprehend half of what they re saying gleeson and mcdonald together make i went down a trip worth taking the film is in many ways reminiscent of another little independent feature s highway that film too was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson s tale whimsical observations on life carefully crafted vignettes deadpan conversational asides and scenes that ll make you laugh out loud witness the episode in which our good natured protagonists bind frank played by peter caffrey to a hotel bed leaving him with only the tv remote for company that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in highway what s also charming about i went down is how the relationship between buddy and git develops their trip becomes an education for both of them but the way it s handled is neither sappy nor labored the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation via flashbacks of the relationship between frank and tom it s a little too hollywood and what makes i went down so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies sure it s gritty make that grubby but it s also pretty goofy although i went down emphasizes the comedic elements of dis organized crime there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter don t let these deter you though i went down is a little gem it s only playing at one philadelphia area theater and i suspect it won t be there for long so catch it while you can 
i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater on a sunday afternoon when the movie was over and the audience was exiting i didn t hear one negative comment and i didn t have any to offer simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys simon ian michael smith and joe joseph mazzello and what destiny holds for both of them simon is a dwarf who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart surprisingly he does and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle simon thinks god has a plan for him a purpose for his life and his condition he just doesn t know what joe is an illegitimate child referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard who s mom ashley judd won t tell him who his father is simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem the people in the town don t really like him because he isn t natural even his own parents don t care about him and are disappointed they didn t have a normal son he is also harassed in church by the local pastor rev russell david strathairn and simon s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks the only person other than joe that really cares for simon is joe s mom who he also looks up to as a mother it would be just simon s luck that he would accidentally kills joe s mom something you are told at the beginning of the movie joe now motherless as well as fatherless feels the need to find out who his real father is with the help of ben oliver platt the local drama teacher and joe s mom s current boyfriend before her death he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny although not all of it is simon will also look for god s plan for him although he loses a little faith along the way starring in the first and last five minutes of the film is hollywood s newest dramatic actor jim carrey jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off and then tying it up just right this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway and he does a commendable job simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson this is his first film as director but he has written several films including the grumpy old men series he does an outstanding writing and directing job here the film s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat the cast is excellent joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance joseph is outstanding for someone of any age not alone someone who just turned ian michael smith in his film debut has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast i loved this movie it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year take your whole family to see simon birch it is a magnificent film an american masterpiece 
i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean s war picture i still think that it doesn t deserve being the number in the american film institute s list of the greatest american movies and i think that lumet s angry men wilder s witness for the prosecution and kubrick s paths of glory would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in but i can t deny the importance of the bridge on the river kwai cinematically and in its contents the film is set in burma in a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai but the british commanding officer colonel nicholson alec guinness insists corresponding to the geneva conventions that his officers needn t work as simple workmen struggling toughly col nicholson forces the japanese commandant col saito sessue hayakawa to give way in this respect afterwards col nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge he considers it an opportunity to raise his men s morale and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge among them the american shears william holden an escapee from the japanese prison camp and the british major warden jack hawkins a flaw of the picture is the clich d characterization of the japanese people they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge and the film doesn t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in paths of glory lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies this is also perceptible in the conversations between col nicholson and col saito in this regard it is symptomatic that shears who doubts the military logic is a somehow unpleasant person in the film the audience is supposed to applaud col nicholson s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col nicholson takes for his men the plot by passes these risks that means the picture isn t perfect but it has a lot of virtues as well it shows the madness of war and what war can produce in people s minds it shows how col nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others like shears get cynics and the bridge on the river kwai is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti war film despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme david lean s effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense especially in the dramatic though not wholly plausible showdown alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character the other actors deliver very good performances as well jack hildyard s fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses c karl rackwitz klein k ris germany 
people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple techno thriller in such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked but i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff film directed by philip kaufman the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits but the right stuff film isn t even fiction it was based on the non fiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program the plot of the film begins in when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age in order to regain national prestige us government decides to be the first to send man into space best air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired all american image in one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top films made in s such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman s film looks quite atypical for its time with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for s and s age when hollywood used to make films larger than life but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation in s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies the right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risk taking artsy projects the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film the plot is almost non existent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts the film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty on the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases shepard s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean cut marine and future politician john glenn young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard kaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice president lyndon b johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman s superb direction most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world in that setting it s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights but the times are changing ww alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots their entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicity seeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman s superb use of poetic movie language editing is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space another fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period this film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws some of the mercury astronauts aren t fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure on the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long also some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan s america in some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early s time has passed now we don t see astronauts as heroes in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up but this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky and even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema 
with the release of gattaca i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens or aliens in general hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films but what was usually lacking was a good story and good characters and good acting etc contact being the exception and for some reason hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth the closest that i have seen anyway was a space odyssey which made mankind an alien race themselves being dwarfed by the technology which they created now comes gattaca another film about technology reigning supreme except here on our planet the difference between and this one is simple gattaca is more frightening most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering using this premise writer director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills unfortunately due to a lack of advertising i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office since seeing the film i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca lately however i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca most people don t even realize that it is a film despite this fact i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it niccol s film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter better produced and more realistic gattaca begins in the st century procreating is now done in a petri dish and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it natural child birth is considered old fashioned we are introduced to jerome morrow ethan hawke an employee of the gattaca space program one of the directors of the program has been murdered and the main suspect is one vincent freeman the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love however after his birth and through several genetic tests doctors tell his parents that he will have a chance of a weak heart as well as poor eye sight and a short life span as a result both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics anton loren dean is produced without flaws and the competition between brothers spawns vincent has a dream to fly a solo flight around the titan the th moon of saturn but because of his condition gattaca and society in general forces him to do menial labor around the company labeled an in valid vincent s dream seems impossible until he meets a black market dna specialist german tony shalhoub german introduces him to a valid who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident jerome morrow jude law agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools urine blood skin and hair samples etc that he will need to get past gattaca s tight security in exchange vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship after the murder however his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime irene cassini uma thurman is a genetically flawed valid working for gattaca and she begins to fall in love with vincent jerome gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years contact and the arrival and gattaca will rank among them unfortunately whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects laden films it normally gets buried the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs the orange glow of gattaca s scenes are impressive but the sets deserve most of the credit the sets are very well done creating a futuristic sense but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers as we look at the designs we realize that these buildings aren t too far into the future this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day the best thing however is the plot the story is more than your average sci fi thriller at its heart it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies maybe human nature is a result of mankind s flaws if we get rid of flaws do we get rid of dreams as well niccol s intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story or vice versa the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol s part it actually enhances the meaning behind the story ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor giving his best performance of his lifetime so far his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and valid peers uma thurman is well uma thurman her character is slightly underdeveloped but the story isn t about her however thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character he provides several nice touches and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one loren dean gives a nice performance in his well developed character dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank still he does a good job gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film gattaca is rated pg for brief violent images language some sexuality and nudity despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film i wasn t exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty it turned me off slightly but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have if this had been a typical hollywood film it would have ended much differently however with all the mindless science fiction films out there it is nice to have a film which doesn t talk down to its audience i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding g t c and a instead it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want a science fiction film with morals behind it whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca and hopefully audiences will too p s personal note to p j gladnick how dare you call this film the worst film of the year i can t even begin to image what film you do like that frightens me beyond anything 
hollywood has a batting average with elmore leonard adaptations last year s touch was ill conceived and just plain odd but get shorty jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies steven soderburgh master of sex lies and videotape now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery prison double crossing uncut diamonds and oh yeah true love george clooney is the protagonist a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker but for once i didn t want to slap the taste out of his mouth he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant type perfected in hitchcock movies the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other nowhere present is clooney s usual ain t i sexy sneer there s just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty clooney plays a man who s robbed about banks without ever using a gun in the opening scene he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm of course he gets caught so it s not all good it s while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate s albert brooks in a frightful bald wig collection of diamonds in detroit clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans meanwhile there s jennifer lopez unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda she s finally graduated to a worthy role as the u s marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car and lopez makes it a threesome her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney he s covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck and it s a little cramped in there but they manage to make a love connection anyway probably because it s a movie the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir ish crime story the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime and this is no exception although they re not really germane to the plot lopez s relationship with her father dennis farina of get shorty rhames relationship with his christian sister you could call her sister christian and a pop in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it out of sight spans at least three years but has a non linear structure focusing on the jailbreak brooks score and flashing back to earlier times this is a movie with a brain as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves the entire cast does the material justice clooney and lopez coming into their own and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites here s hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch serving america for almost th of a century 
 the celebration is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant you know where you sit down to watch it and no matter what you ve heard about it before you just can t help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like i don t really feel there are to be any real rules for cinema a film can do anything as long as it makes it work but i do ask that all films have one thing in common they create experiences when i watch a film no matter what kind of film it is i want to be able to take certain memories along with me the celebration is great because it s chock full of those it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial just to make sure you re paying attention which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored then you re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning up the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch henning mortizen who has just turned and is having a party thrown for him all his friends and family turn up and for the first half hour we get introduced to everyone simplistically and realistically no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here the eldest son christian ulrich thomsen looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell is the first to be seen in the film walking to his father s home his brother michael thomas bo larsen drives by pulls over greets him then kicks his family out of the car forcing them to walk to the estate just so christian can be comfortable we then meet helene paprika steen their sister a woman who always seems to be stressed out who invites the driver of her car gbatokai dakinah an american to to come join her at the party she s going to once they re all there and settled in the party begins and as custom the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad so christian stands up at the head of the table and reveals the film s punchline his father raped all his children at a young age but since this is a family friends affair his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth and is simply brushed off despite his efforts and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir and it s all terribly interesting to watch twists occur and soon the film has taken on a nearly farsical nature but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends the most notorious thing about this film which has been getting the most notice though is that the director thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion as a member of the danish filmmakers clan dogme a group that has vowed to oppose the auteur concept make up illusions and dramaturgical predictability so that they may purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot i have not seen breaking the waves the other notable film by a member of this group lars von trier to be exact but the celebration works exquisitely in this department it feels like reality like you re actually watching real people and not actors and as a major pointer has been shot on video as a result it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film but always wanted to we see key moments in people s lives that they wouldn t dare show to the world and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style as ironically showmanship as it really is works perfectly for the nature of the film the key though to this film and the reason it s not just a cool danish import is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth throughout the film we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies a debate so three dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the truth at all costs reasoning out of the water of course it was not right for the father to rape his children and of course they couldn t have fought back then and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them and yes it s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier but then again the father after all is not a totally bad guy and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he s done and deep down feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface the final scene involving mortizen and everyone else is utterly devastating thanks to him and thomsen whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex everyone else is flawless as well the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays exactly like life as such the celebration may be the one truly bizarro film of the year a work of art so eerily close to reality that it s utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating 
it stands as a moment one will not soon forget a giant green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek dreamworks second computer animated feature but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema a page of this tale serves as that ogre s toilet paper from this opening moment one can infer shrek s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard disney esque fairy tale although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship courage and acceptance excelled by outstanding direction stunning actor voice work and most importantly a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline shrek the previously mentioned ogre holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider known only as the donkey his species who talks and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines along the journey to rescue fiona donkey s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self acknowledgment but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant fire breathing dragon guarding fiona either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them secondly upon shrek s and donkey s redeeming of princess fiona the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her to satisfy her desire for a human knight in shining armor throughout this storyline shrek faces his deep perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth but eventually shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it if one sets his her mind to overcoming something in particular endless possibilities exist after the friendships and courage prevail the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development acceptance surprisingly fiona holds a dark secret of her own due to a spell cast upon her years ago she transforms into an ogre by night in this storyline fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself and she must realize what beauty truly means to simply act as one s self upon fiona s learning of shrek s desire to pursue a relationship with her fiona knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work gives in to her inner demons of self ridicule and hatred any child can pull from fiona s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self acceptance on the technical side shrek triumphs directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers shrek eddie murphy donkey and cameron diaz princess fiona myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other normal beings murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona giving the princess ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay written by ted elliott terry rossio joe stillman and roger s h schulman the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike capping it off with a constant tongue in cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers with shrek dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come the smaller children will laugh and cheer the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages 
the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam fitting since the media saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment while driving through a long flat iraqi desert in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament one of the men under special forces sgt maj archie gates who s steering command requests a beach boys tune these men want their apocalypse now moment only instead of surfing they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle armed with automatic rifles our three kings okay four are good fighters but they don t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously it s a reprieve from their hellish day jobs they are gates new father sgt troy barlow wahlberg sgt chief elgin cube and pvt conrad vig music video director jonze at story s start president bush has declared a ceasefire and american troops are tying up loose ends barlow elgin and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an ass map that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation he proposes demands that barlow elgin and vig join him on a treasure hunt ditching his escort a relentless reporter named adriana cruz nora dunn is easy so is finding the treasure until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq saddam s men are threatening the dictator s detractors citizens of his own country with violence when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck ready to loot the unarmed rebels want help bush encouraged them to rise up against the government but provided no military support for such cause gates convinces the vault s guards that this is a post war mission and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck the situation could go off without a hitch the former enemies bear no grudges but the money hungry gates has a conscience and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene he orders barlow elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces the result barlow is kidnapped and the filmmakers imply that these would be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device his interrogator lost his family to the bombs and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child he does in chilling lasting images i liked these scenes best because the political became personal it s one thing to champion the plight of thousands it s another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib russell has shocked us before his first film spanking the monkey is about a young man s affair with his bedridden mother it s great his second flirting with disaster features a character who has an armpit fetish one could argue that it s easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions though russell disturbs us in three kings by being no nonsense about the violence when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home russell mutes the sound we re paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast three kings is russell s first visually arresting picture stylistically it stands apart from other war dramas newton thomas sigel s cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy which is of course entirely appropriate one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen a friend enthusiastically added it s like having sand in your eyes this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade three kings was shot in arizona california and mexico russell throws plenty at sigel s camera for it to observe as was the case with russell s previous efforts the most absurd moments are also the film s most realistic even the most poignant we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside if anything three kings settles down and stops surprising us its climax is pure hollywood no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie minded russell subsequently the characters become more cartoonish barlow s post torture revelry felt phony and chief a strong presence in the first third fails to escape the god fearing ultra serious anti racist black man of power clich so much for cube avoiding token status the arab players on the other hand duck stereotype clooney too transforms into a blandly heroic protestor marching with the rebels i waited for him to shout let my people go hayseed vig notwithstanding the protagonists are very intelligent and self serving too i had a glimmer of hope based on russell s filmography that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture it s not spoiling much to write that then again what historical importance would such nastiness serve there s already enough cynicism in the film s mentioning of kuwait s oil infested waters russell offers the masses a primer on the oft dismissed gulf conflict and pulled off a neat trick a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared if he set out to make something socially culturally politically globally significant he succeeded with flair 
titanic is without a doubt the best movie i ve seen all year and believe me i m not an easy critic to impress the english patient was too long men in black was over hyped and several of the big summer releases were dead in the water thank god this film got delayed until december it s my christmas present titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years gone by and it is truly a stunning film while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized never taking your eyes off the screen nor checking your watch to see how much longer it s gonna last despite its hour plus running time as a friend of mine who s a true titanic buff said if someone doesn t like this film it s because they didn t want to truer words are hard to come by of course it doesn t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors james cameron who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time if you wish to argue that point with me look at his list of credits the terminator aliens the abyss terminator true lies etc still care to disagree not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film he also wrote produced and edited it and to show his true faith for the project he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs it s obvious he truly loves titanic the film opens with footage both real and fake of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the heart of the ocean which according to bill paxton s character would be worth more than the hope diamond today their search turns up dissapointly no diamond but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a year old woman named rose who claims to be the girl in the picture she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past rose s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl engaged to a rich man named cal hockley billy zane that she didn t want to marry her mother is pushy and obnoxious and cal hockley is arrogant they are boarding the titanic which is sailing to america and this is where she is to marry cal meanwhile a young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and his italian friend danny nucci win two rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game they are overjoyed and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving for them this is their ticket to america to a better life for rose she is sailing to her doom the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt kate winslet and jack dawson fall in love it s the classic wrong side of the tracks story and does sometimes resort to a few cliches but as i said above the love portion isn t sappy and doesn t weigh the film down as some critics have said it s sweet and it didn t make me restless at all despite the fact that i usually hate love stories of course it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in including the enigmatic molly brown played by the talented kathy bates the captain of titanic bernard hill and so on all of these characters add an extra depth to the film and make it that easier to watch of course things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom the sinking is depicted realisticly and the effects are truly amazing it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either as people are portrayed as panicking pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats and drowning and dying horrible deaths the best part of the movie in my opinion comes at the very end when we flash back to the future the crew who at first had been skeptical of rose s story now are totally aborbed by her rose goes out onto the ship s ledge and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard we then see a dream of rose s in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream however i think it symbolized more i think it meant that rose had died and is going to a sort of heaven which would be the happiest part of her life her and her one true love jack if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this e mail me at venom hotmail com 
call it touched by a demon gregory hoblit s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual horrific twist if marketed properly this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven in fact there s even a little twin peaks to be found here albeit with the lion s share of the weirdness distilled out remember bob the biggest failing of fallen is that although it s consistently interesting it s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope a serial killer elias koteas has been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force has brought him to justice now during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes what goes around really goes around shortly thereafter he begins to sing time is on my side as he s taken on his last walk minutes later the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead but for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese wasn t a normal psychopath he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel and with reese s death azazel is free to hop from body to body murdering and wreaking havoc at will only hobbes and a pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what they re up against the rest of the cops including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini a newcomer to the department and lieutenant stanton donald sutherland don t have a clue and as a result they are in mortal danger as depicted by hoblit primal fear and cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia is a dark dreary place a gothic city rather than a modern one no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown the most famous landmark to appear isn t the liberty bell or independence hall it s geno s steaks shadows and night scenes abound the days are cloudy and unpromising this is the kind of setting where it s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men fallen s plot is brimming with potential not all of which is realized somehow i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise but the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check nevertheless there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual of the several dozen actors to play azazel the best is by far elias koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minutes gives a fantastically charged performance john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick sadly however these two are the only ones who excel everyone else including denzel washington is boring washington s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film it s not that he s bad per se but he s not very interesting there s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keeps us distanced however slightly from hobbes as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop and as his life or death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was washington s subdued approach is part of the reason for this i never felt a sense of urgency however at least washington was believable which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindler s list and donald sutherland to be fair the flaws in their characters aren t all acting related neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written that said however there s nothing inspired about either davidtz s or sutherland s work both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi dimensional individual narratively fallen has a few glaring weaknesses although the plot proceeds with a convoluted game like structure it uses a denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matters at times this is actually helpful and it has a use beyond the obvious but there are occasions when ponderous lines like i like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself become a little hard to swallow in addition fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel however despite the negatives i m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending which i loved the final scenes are startling audacious and unexpected it s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself this is not a great motion picture but considering how bad most january releases are it s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours and whatever you do don t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll

meet joe black is your classic boy meets girl boy likes girl boy gets killed in horrible accident supernatural entity takes over boy s body supernatural entity falls in love with girl story based on the film death takes a holiday meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love william parrish anthony hopkins is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his th birthday he has built a huge media empire and raised two beautiful daughters allison marcia gay harden and susan claire forlani william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality the one situation he won t be able to talk his way out of and he has good reason to fear for death himself is stalking him however death has a deal to make death has taken possession of a man who has recently died brad pitt and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living in return william gets to live a few extra days of course he agrees death under the human name of joe black gets to experience life as a complete innocent he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter and he s not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love but is their affair doomed to an early demise at nearly three hours in length meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side though it never gets boringly lengthy instead the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere rather than being hurriedly rushed through it the romantic angle works well though surprisingly the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter this is most likely due to anthony hopkins who once again displays his superb acting skills william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life and doesn t want to let it go by contrast claire forlani is merely the romantic interest she gets to show joe the ropes of love but is hardly as interesting a character as joe black brad pitt seems a bit stilted granted he s supposed to be out of place but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role still he is able to hold his own and over the course of the three hours his character begins to grow on you the main character who seems out of place here is drew jake weber an ambitious executive in williams company who is joe black s main rival for susan s affections weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily but never distractingly so we never learn what is the exact nature of death or why he s never done something like this before it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices accents his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter and the ultimate resolution to one of the film s supernatural problems seems well somewhat superficial still even with the film s length it was a pleasant time at the movies something you wouldn t necessarily expect from a film about death but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow 
ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan you remember he was the title character in that s sitcom welcome back kotter always trying to help out the sweathogs frequently trying to dodge mr woodman ever wary of his wife s tuna casserole so you ask where is he now mr kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high stakes poker that s right i m not sure if it s his main source of income but from what i ve heard the guy occasionally comes away with at a time and there you were thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off broadway theater you silly goose well gabe kaplan isn t in the movie rounders nor is the film about the actor come gambler s life but rounders is about poker and gabe plays poker and i thought that was kind of a neat connection sorry about the segue or lack thereof matt damon plays mike mcdermott a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker he s been playing for a while and more than being proficient he has caught the bug he goes to all the underground games in new york city knows the regulars and knows how to win in the beginning of the film he s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg which he takes to the speakeasy type gaming parlor where the big boys play mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb john malkovich an oreo munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker but instead he loses it all in a single hand months later he s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck when mike s best friend and poker buddy worm edward norton finishes his jail term for hustling some students he wants to pick up right were they left off working as a team to part others with their betting cash although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student jo gretchen mol worm connives mike into playing once more and mike bitten again by the bug slides down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life to make a film about gambling a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth rounders however seems to go more for the latter than the former the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren t very glamorous at all there s a basement a lodge with elk heads on the wall a goulash joint these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it we re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations and good actors to play them matt damon is very natural as mike who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school and answering what may be his true calling playing professional poker ed norton s worm is truly a worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they re worth john turturro who amazes me with his acting range tones it down in this film by playing joey knish a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments he s both a friend and mentor to mike and turturro s low key performance is totally convincing just as john malkovich s heavily accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike s law professors abe petrovsky while landau slips well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one s self facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line up of acting talent however is gretchen mol who just didn t seem to have much presence on screen she s a genuine peach to look at kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and i wouldn t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world but her delivered lines seemed very flat and i found myself looking for matt damon s reactions instead a good thing about rounders is that it doesn t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can t find time for humor the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next in widely different locales one game in a cigar club had me in stitches i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper says one of the players clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys with all the poker being played rounders had the potential to be very confusing you might think you know a lot about poker but think again luckily we re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what s going on the narrations are more informative than intrusive and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do it s nice that as the characters develop so does our comprehension of their world as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker rounders delivers in spades wait as a film about the culture of cards rounders is an ace hang on packed with great acting and great characters rounders is a full house okay i guess that s enough oh by the way if you ever want to get into a game with ol gabe kaplan be sure to bring a note from epstein s mother 
an astonishingly difficult movie to watch the last temptation of christ may be scorsese s most important film and yet his most impossibly abstract as well scorsese presents the life of jesus christ through nikos kazantzakis novel which details the life of christ from approximately until the day of crucifixtion jesus of nazareth dafoe is a carpenter who opens the film making crosses so that he can escape the fate he is subjected to his destiny on earth yet he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others and subjects himself to a desert in exile in hopes that he can reach god before leaving he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene barbara hershey a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus after going to the desert christ learns his true purpose in life and what he must do aided by judas keitel he sets off on teaching the world his message along the way he meets john the baptist the rest of the prophets and tries to teach the world his message christ is also confronted by internal demons and self doubt as he tries to find his true purpose throughout the entire film during the story judas is the closese ally of jesus his betrayal argues the film was not out of hate but out of love in order to allow christ to die he is eventually captured and crucified as per the bibile however as he is about to die on the cross he is saved by a girl who brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene the girl is a guardian angel who is from god and who has saved him from his death jesus goes on to live a life as a man as a carpenter and does not die on the cross on his deathbed in the final moments of his life he is visited by the prophets and by judas who denounces his master for not keeping his end of the bargain judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act jesus escapes from his deathbed and asks his father for forgiveness for succumbing to his last temptation visually and aurally the film is absolutely breathtaking no other director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of christ s life to the screen peter gabriel contributes a score than is simply astonishing with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer the performances are simply exquisite with dafoe leading the way with a mesmerizing turn as jesus keitel although his accent is a problem is passionately brilliant fighting through language to bring the character to life the visuals are also amazing scorsese frames his movie in a harsh tone leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is having human frailties the film though has many trouble spots paul schrader s script is one schrader uses modern day new york english to tell the story along with new york words new york mannerisms and new york slang speech the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ there is no underlying message behind the man s words the film fails to capture the glory and splendor of christ had it faithfully explored that aspect than the dichotomy of jesus soul his frailties and doubt mixed with his unmistakable glory would have been simply spectacular the message of christ is confused between love and violence and the film merely tells us jesus is great instead of showing us his greatness the film is also overlong it just drags in the middle with nothing truly happening christ is a confused figure in the sense that the audience doesn t know who he really is schrader forgets to give jesus a message to show that he truly is the messiah to give him the divinity without that he is a rambling prophet who the audience themselves do not believe there are several moments of accidental hilarity and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach there are moments of brief awe and power followed by moments of confused hilarity that said the controversial temptation sequence is something to behold it is a step in an unexpected direction one that leaves the audience puzzled until the arrival of the disciples it is a simply breathtaking scene with jesus about to die as a mortal it is truly one of scorsese s finest moments it is unfortunate that scorsese couldn t make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene 
unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric ostensibly the film is a documentary but use of that term requires stretching its meaning many scenes appear staged and a great deal of cutting and pasting has been done in the editing room the cinema verite effect is a conceit genuine spontaneity is at a premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera especially would be actresses like cindy crawford director douglas keeve who was mizrahi s lover at the time freely admits that he couldn t care less about the truth but was more interested in capturing the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion despite violating nearly every rule of legitimate documentary film making however unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment while it sheds only a little light on the behind the scenes world of the fashion industry it presents a fascinating if incomplete picture of designer mizrahi this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study he s funny energetic and eminently quotable he has unusual views on just about everything from fashion it s about women not wanting to look like cows to mary tyler moore between her and jackie kennedy they shaped this country to style it s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress it s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection in particular unzipped traces mizrahi s development of his fall line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show which highlights a number of prominent models including cindy crawford naomi campbell kate bush and linda evangelista on the technical side a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped a variety of film stocks were used super mm black and white and mm color there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie and during the climactic fashion show color is used to show the audience s perspective while black and white is for the behind the scenes sequences nevertheless some viewers will be put off by this treatment while unzipped isn t an expose on the fashion industry per se keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear overall however this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed when the designer declares that everything is frustrating except designing clothes that s beautiful and liberating it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed

another independent film this comedy which was brought by miramax for million is good fun favreau and vaughn the lost world jurassic park play mike and trent two everyday somethings on the lookout for women the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve and along the way we get to meet some of their friends see their attempts at chatting up girls and just basically get a insight into their lives and all of this is great fun swingers doesn t rely on huge special effects or big name stars to provide entertainment no it just has a great script and superb little known actors the script by favreau is great mike is always missing is girlfriend who hasn t called him for six months and every time he meets a girl he always end up telling her about the ex the audience feels for this pathetic little man thanks to the great script vaughn is the money swingers speak for the best as the womanizing trent always on the lookout for a new girl some of his chat up lines are awful but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his hard man nature vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film towards the end in a diner the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great but it never quite reaches tarantino standards which i suspect the film was trying to reach there are some excellent laugh out loud jokes in the film and some superbly funny set pieces such as favreau cringe worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence embarrassing to him hilarious to the audience mike trents friends are also good although there characters seem a bit underwritten and we never really learn as much as we would like about them although this is primarily mike and trents film it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background but again the lines they say are usually pretty good and they do have some funny parts it s just a shame that they didn t have more meatier roles the acting is superb as said above vaughn is superb as trent he s definitely the best thing in the film favreau is also good acting as the little man very well and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny graham boogie nights has a small but good role as lorraine a girl mike finally falls in love with she hardly features in the film at all but she still manages to make an impact on the audience swingers then is funny but it does have some flaws firstly the running time is a bit too short the film comes to an abrupt halt and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion which is a shame as most films are too long also this type of film has been done too many times such as sleep with me but these small flaws don t really spoil what is a funny entertaining comedy 
with his last two films shine and snow falling on cedars australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there and his latest hearts in atlantis is no different its structure beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle is similar to the green mile which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books the parallels don t end there either atlantis was adapted by william goldman who had previously penned the big screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king s dreamcatcher even the film s content is a bit reminiscent of mile in fact it s the perfect blend of the feel good s nostalgia of stand by me also by king and mystical power hokum of mile king s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories but the main focus here is on the first and longest tale called low men in yellow coats the film s title comes from the second chapter it s set in harwich connecticut where year old bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in a boarding house run by his cold self centered mother elizabeth hope davis joe gould s secret who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son bobby spends his time with his two closest friends john sullivan will rothhaar and tomboy carol gerber mika boorem who become something like the kevin paul and winnie of harwich when a new tenant moves into the vacant room the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan anthony hopkins hannibal a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers i won t go into what these powers are but they re considerably toned down from the book and don t involve black stuff flying out of ted s mouth a la mile atlantis present day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel s final chapter titled heavenly shades of night are falling and features david morse in yet another connection to the green mile as a married middle aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks cedars which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski the oscar nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski s red the acting is solid from everyone including hopkins who never once makes you think of dr lecter most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem who both had tiny parts in along came a spider while i didn t really have much of a problem with goldman s screenplay i do need to point out at least one inconsistency goldman for those of you who don t read premiere writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else s films carefully explaining why they all suck make no sense and insult their audiences while somehow failing to mention the crap that he s penned like the general s daughter it s mean spirited but fun to read mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business including michael jackson o j and robert blake in atlantis which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back well he s not and it doesn t make sense pg for violence and thematic elements 
a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation state against another a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocents anywhere at anytime that gives the figure his label edward zwick s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states you d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad and the u s responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack however unlike the real life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden s camp and manufacturing facility the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal in retaliation the terrorists bring the fight to the new world unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent in charge anthony hubbard denzel washington who works out of the bureau s new york office at one federal plaza while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple he encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying to uncover information generally the fbi is charged with problems inside the u s while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but as the two form a tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government the original tagline for patriot games was there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil however true it was pulled before the movie s release because it sounded too much like a dare revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america admittedly the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive who s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two thirds but the basic premise is still valid i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action thriller fare of good guy g men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab american population and that in an effort to find the terrorists the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself in fact about halfway through the film when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberties of all americans are put at risk although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups throughout the film maintains a conflict between hubbard who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides it actually gets rather heady at times but it s a credit to screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they don t underestimate the intelligence of the audience i don t know if it s his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great this combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid level authority figure makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i ve seen recently and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable it s somewhat unfortunate that her character s fortitude is broken at a certain point but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough guy role always standing straight and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face however the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film s development notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad a lebanese immigrant the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society difficult to say the least shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick s favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems to be his favorite composer i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian themed music and horner s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish sounding at most revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole it s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we ve been getting throughout the year missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes for example it s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick unfortunately there s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye catching in the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than feet from friendly troops verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point the film also gets a little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different races to get along a noble gesture the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously these flaws are glaring but they don t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class 
city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most thought provoking moving and completely unsentimental i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality city of angels is a wonderful film enhanced by interesting and well rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years it s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story and avoids most of the cliches we re so used to seeing in films like this city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders film wings of desire i have yet to see wings of desire so i am unfortunately unable to make a comparison of the two i have heard however that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways which makes me glad that this film isn t a rip off of its source material nicolas cage stars as seth an angel who like all of his angel counterparts is present to lead the dying to heaven or somewhere just like it one day he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr maggie rice meg ryan and his attention is called to her the angels can make themselves seen to humans but they can t experience any of the senses most importantly touch he shows himself to maggie and she falls for him unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status seth wants to become human so he can feel her that s when he meets nathaniel messinger dennis franz former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race as a side note i found messinger to be the most fascinating character for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel i know it sounds ridiculous but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well done after much deliberation she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel this of course is when seth decides to take the plunge literally from a building when he wakes up from the fall he is human and happy to feel what it s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead since i love this film so much i ll make a minor note that it certainly isn t perfect although it is original and mesmerizing it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic though the details are what make the story excellent and steel has done a great job with them the ending too could have been more powerful and less predictable these elements are minor though and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels the acting is superb from everyone involved this is perhaps my second favorite performance from cage my favorite being the rock he s quiet and pensive and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly toned words he s perfect for a role like this and at the same time he reassures us he s not bound by playing the psycho though he is good at it as he shows in face off meg ryan is a powerful enticing and appealingly chirpy actress and her work here is some of her best dennis franz however steals all of his scenes as the energetic former angel what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation director brad silberling is a talented man and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters rather than forced sentimentality his direction is steady and he shows this in just about every scene near the beginning maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead there is no music or elaborate camera work we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information this is the way stories should be told and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do cinematographer john seale the english patient provides some of the most stunning images i ve seen on the big screen hundreds of black clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours just as an example the music by gabriel yared also of the english patient is perfect for this film it s quiet and moody music but not sentimental and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of so far all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre it s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously 
now lets first look into the history of shark films there was the unforgettable jaws the exciting jaws the rather flaky jaws d and sometime in the late s another film of the same genre that i can t seem to recall about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that now with the magic of cgi one shark is simply not enough in deep blue sea there are big mean and really smart ones russell frankiln jackson visits aquatica a sea bound research center where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer s disease the substance is small in quantity and because of this lead researcher dr susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones as sure as the sun sets in the west a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure with the flexibility offered by cgi the sharks get more full length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote controlled rubber suit days gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after this time we get to see the entire gobbling action with floating limbs and all so so acting expected in most of your average action film jackson fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace takes on the dark side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise cracking lines ll cool j s cook role as preacher does for this film what steven seagal s cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer it does however prove to be a refreshing follow up within the genre full of visual thrills suspense and believe it or not humour its like jurassic park under water nothing too stressful pure entertainment renny harlin you are forgiven for making cutthroat island 
i remember making a pact right after patch adams to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality but darn it music of the heart is just layered with feel good material and bright characterizations it s hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it s manipulation in addition it s also a terrific family film this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools it could also be described as mrs streep s opus yes meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari and that brings both good news and bad out of the gate possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta s character and grasp her academic point of view she is very strict with her students but what insight does that create into the story slowly but surely we begin to recognize the intentions of the character and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied one thoroughly interesting fact about music of the heart lies with the unlikely presence in the director s chair horror veteran wes craven after leaving an impression with the scream films and the original nightmare on elm street craven has attempted a precarious cross over to drama at first his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material it doesn t carry the heart warming courage of mr holland s opus but music of the heart is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate yes oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep but it s the solid ensemble cast that makes music of the heart work angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn t hire roberta because of her lack of experience blue eyed adian quinn is endearing as always playing a new love interest gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second grade teacher and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force it s like a schoolteacher s version of thelma and louise in a restrained but effective manner the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari s teaching of violin there s some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman in it s dramatic build up the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth it s a good movie for anyone to see although missing out on the experience would not be a life altering decision it s commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross over and also for achieving his intricate goal watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments who may ask yourself this is the guy who directed scream of course when the third installment of that series comes around in february with craven directing you may find yourself wondering this is the guy who directed music of the heart mission accomplished wes thankfully there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film in it s entirety it s a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile the child actors are cute and perform up to par even if some of their problems are clich d and predictable in the extreme the mother who doesn t want her son to be learning white man s music the unexpected casuality basically everything is there it doesn t strike the perfect chord but music of the heart is highly convincing the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better but music of the heart is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals 
an indian runner was more than a courier he became the message he was carrying what danger is a bear to a message i used to think sean penn was an immature arrogant photographer punching madonna marrying loudmouth but all that has changed now the guy has grown up and that s not all it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director if this film is any indication one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper but no this film is about a real struggle and the victories and defeats are not simple penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters without unnecessary rush or flash the focus of the story is two brothers david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer viggo mortensen is the wild brother whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can t name much less resolve the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared the film is unobtrusive simple direct plain and sincere it isn t exactly perfect but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems this is a good film without big budget sets or big name stars pushed into your face in fact i m reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing there were perhaps others at the showing i saw i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified though there are a few free form sections which also work very well the obligatory s music seemed a little cliche but what are you going to do this movie does take place in the s after all in my opinion it is worth full price admission 
you ve got to love disney no matter what they serve up it is a guaranteed success as long as it s animated kids have to go see the movie then they have to get the toys oh the video came out got to buy it or risk little billy s temper tantrums for the next month all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca a visit to the magic kingdom stay at the disneyland hotel buy a disney t shirt eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick it s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it dale carnegie should have had it so good what s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality you see disney animated features these days have two components theme and plot the theme changes with each new movie the plot does not the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same however while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box office receipts merchandising dollars and glimmers in the eyes of little children critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer luckily disney s latest animated offering mulan manages to be engaging and refreshing even while rife with formula the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns led by the imposing shan yu miguel ferrer soon china s emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china s defense when the fa family is served notice it is the elderly father fa zhou soon tek oh who must answer the call as there are no other males in the household fearing her father will surely be killed in battle fa mulan ming na wen disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army mulan based on a chinese epic poem is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman s role and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband we see that grace is not one of her strong points very early on we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one s family and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker mulan fails at that task by leaving home to fight in her father s place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too as is the case with most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film i m not sure if they will get much airplay but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time both lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain of mulan s army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salonga s voice translates much better to animation you have to hear it to understand interestingly the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan there is no significantly big number which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie it is however an expectation which has been built by disney s own formulaic history and some viewers may feel as if something is missing artistically the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works it helps to contribute a more authentic and therefore more credible nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically disneyfied ethnic tale there are also a couple of visually standout scenes one involving the charge of shan yu s hun army which utilizes the same computer enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it when mulan resolves to take her father s place she dons her father s old battle armor and unsheathes a sword as she does so you can see her reflection in the polished metal it just left me thinking that was really cool a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film varying from the straight such as soon tek oh as fa zhou to the comical such as harvey fierstein as yao a gruff pugilistic member of shang s conscripted army even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance i found the choice of b d wong as shang a little strange you may remember him as martin short s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast so i guess anything s possible in any event wong performs admirably as well one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people june foray who supplies grandmother fa s speaking voice is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale as in boris and natasha marni nixon who provides grandmother fa s singing voice is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i maria in west side story and eliza in my fair lady with this in mind hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films in an effort to be culturally sensitive and to avoid a miss saigon type debacle disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian american actors for both lead and supporting roles in addition to the actors already mentioned the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong gedde watanabe james shigeta and george takei i guess clyde kusatsu wasn t available at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and happily adults this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next rather than hope that the next one is better 
it s ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director s cut of the film films such as aliens the abyss the wild bunch blade runner and terminator are all prime examples of a filmmaker s integrity later chopped up or mucked with by the studio the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson s masterpiece the professional which is known as l on around the world is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director s cut for years i have heard of an international version available only in laserdisc format which has eluded me for years i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for bucks just to watch certain directors cuts including l on but after countless searches in laserdisc stores i could never find it until now the film follows the story of l on played by jean reno a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello he lives next door to a ferociously independent year old girl named mathilda played by then newcomer natalie portman whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops one day a crew of the cops lead by gary oldman in an over the top performance kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries taking pity on her l on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life mathilda learns of l on s hit man profession and decides to follow in l on s footsteps as a cleaner she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l on he has kept locked away as part of his profession at this point the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in the international version contains an additional minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l on and mathilda footage that american censors deemed too explicit i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda s and l on s motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops there s even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean hugues anglade star of queen margot besson s la femme nikita and killing zoe with these additional scenes replaced l on and matilda s relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes the film becomes primarily a heavy emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional throw down twenty bucks and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece director writer luc besson producer luc besson claude besson starring jean reno natalie portman gary oldman danny aiello 
are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny director writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film next stop wonderland the two main characters alan and erin spend the entire movie in each other s orbit catching glimpses of one another yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life as the film starts erin castleton hope davis a melancholy year old late shift nurse is ending her live in relationship with her boyfriend hoffman rather he is ending it with her arriving home from work erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment car packed with his belongings in a fumbling amusing and self deluding ramble he instructs erin to watch a videotape he s made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he s leaving it s obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief erin s mother holland taylor in a surprisingly effective small role fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life takes out a personal ad for erin to erin s embarrassed horror the ad describes her as a frisky cultured carefree professional with a zest for life eventually erin responds to the tidal wave of responses which makes for some of the most humorous telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and poseurs alan a plumber and aspiring marine biologist first spots erin as he s cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium wearing a wet suit and goggles he follows erin from window to window separated by the glass as erin oblivious to his gaze enjoys the fish later we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside mere feet away the movie spends it s entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing there are several subplots involving alan one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business another subplot involves his father s desperate attempts to force fate s hand by gambling away his life at the dog track a distracting focus is put on alan s debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy thankfully his dream guy persona is counterbalanced by erin s distant yet fundamentally hopeful personality the film moves along at an unhurried pace albeit too much so in the latter third as we wait for the two to meet co writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over when alan and erin eventually do meet we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering almost subliminally knowing gaze it s a sweet measured moment the disappointment comes in the fact that we ve come to know the pair yet we don t get to view their impending romance the film s inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one s life makes next stop wonderland a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions shallow characters and overdone special effects 
what s shocking about carlito s way is how good it is having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino s previous film scent of a woman and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one he had just won an oscar carlito s way was destined for underrated heaven that s what it is an underrated gem of a movie and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study carlito s way deals with well carlito brigante pacino a puerto rican ex drug kingpin who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke addicted curly haired lawyer sean penn points out a legal technicality of course carlito was actually awoken in prison and has decided to go straight even if he s really a crook at heart carlito like barry lyndon is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn and can t escape into something he is not carlito s attempts at a clean legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn when he first gets out a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot out where he has to kill a couple people to survive he s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he s doing anything illegal and his lawyer finds himself neck deep in a pile of shit needing him to try and help him out which includes him doing some prison breaking carlito like ratso rizzo wants to go to miami since according to film logic that s where it s at but needs some funding being a legend he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club this is the s by the way and since some of this takes place in night clubs we get to hear all sorts of s classics including several k c and the sunshine band tunes my personal favorite he gets a bodyguard the great luis guzman at his best and is soon running a pretty good business even if he s constantly attracting underworld young thugs like benny blanco from the bronx john leguiziamo who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito on the other side the symbol of promise and hope is gail penelope ann miller what happened to her his girlfriend from before prison she s a goregeous ballerina and a stripper and soon carlito is trying to get back with her and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami while this relationship is never fully defined or anything we get a sense of love between them and they have some truly interesting scenes between them she never gives him addresses or locales he always has to track her down all of these elements clash together at the end in a brilliantly executed emotional climax which is inevitable when i say inevitable i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack putting a great spin on it sure it s going to eleveate some of the tension but it gives the film a lot of depth as carlito is seen trapped by fate what s amazing is the big chase sequence amazingly done by de palma has a lot of tension and thrills like apollo we know what s going to happen but we re still thrilled by what happens in the middle it s also very emotional thanks to a great script by david koepp and amazing performances by pacino and miller de palma is famous or infamous for lots of violence in his films his earlier flim scarface which starred pacino in the lead has a ton of it especially at the end and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i m still not over but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes to me the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet this is the most brilliantly done and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film and probably the best in de palma film history with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito s head and a saddened remorseful look on pacino s face it s a tear jerker well for me i dunno about you the acting from all is great especially from the three leads pacino was panned for his performance chiefly because his accent wasn t puerto rican enough and well it wasn t as strong as his oscar winning role in scent of a woman well his scent of a woman performance was great and all but it was nothing really but as comic kevin pollack said a foghorn leghorn impression in carlito s way he s emotional and strong despite the fact that he s remorseful over his entire lifestyle which he cannot change i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango dancing insult throwing blind guy in scent of a woman as i said penelope ann miller is great and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry and they re scenes are well written with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship and sean penn is amazing as the coke addicted rat attorney every scene he s in he has great energy and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino in smaller roles john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great carlito s way is one of those films which you heard about briefly but when you finally watch it you re absolutely blown away it s a wonderful film a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn t do so hot but trust me and check it out it s a great little film and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right 
usually when a blockbuster comes out it s loaded with effects stars bad scripts and plenty of action mystery men may contain an all star cast and efects but the clever script and characters are what really works which is rare to see this year the film is based upon the comic book series the flaming carrot by bob burden in which wanna be super heroes try and fight crime only to be out done by the real hero of champion city captain amazing greg kinnear things go a little haywire when the sinister casanova frankenstein geoffrey rush is released into the city where he captures captain amazing and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city well the trio decide to take matters in their own hands by saving the city but first they need some assitance this is where the film takes a turn for the better in the beggining there were only wanna be heroes blue raja hank azaria mr furious ben stiller and the shoveller william h macy sure they were enterataining but their acts grew old fast that is until they aquire invisible boy kel mitchell and the bowler janeane garafalo and mr splein paul reubens of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess thankfully the original heroes become amusing with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen the whole premise is rather ridiculous but packs a few punches to keep interest for one the film is considerably clever it literally pokes fun at super hero films like batman and robin superman etc in fact many scenes are similar to batman and robin including the opening sequence only altered in a humorous and superior way a part of the cleverness comes from the cast sometimes a film with such talent is overblown but the acting is what keeps it alive here while azaria and macy were enteratining characters really stood out one was paul reuben no matter how disgusting or revolting mr splein may be you still can t help but laugh it so incredibly moronic it s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions janeane garafalo also was an interesting character she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem due to her enthusiasm that kept the film flowing men is worth seeing alone for those troubled heroes on the downside a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off kel mitchell and geoffrey rush were both utterly useless their parts were so limited they d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than minutes ben stiller too was wasted mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue none of these characters get a rise out of anybody but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film as far as the budget goes it was wisely spent on the cast not the effects while the set designs and action all look nice i m glad there was a seperate aspect that the film focused on and for that i applaud slow at times and rather pointless mystery men still delivers it forgets about money making because it s not likely to make a bundle like it s proceeders and that s what works stupid maybe but for once i m not disappointed no one expected an intelligent film but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year

as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences you know the type his shirt is always shredded his face always scarred he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a to kill list for his enemies oscar hungry director executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to but he made the stereotypical action hero for the th century as gibson delivers lines like before this war is over i am going to kill you schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind oddly enough the patriot is as much an epic three hour tear fest like gladiator as it is a ninety minute guilty pleasure at times absorbing at others enjoyably insipid this is good bloody summer fun i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july th weekend some of the images are so zealously americanized the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it like emmerich s id this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all sure it s predictable and melodramatic but for a moment after leaving the theater i was dumbfounded with patriotism and isn t that the point of the patriot gibson plays benjamin martin the lionized french and indian war veteran who at the beginning of the film is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants not slaves as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel jason isaacs martin quickly decides to save the day or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war martin becomes the number one target of the british army the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis tom wilkinson face was priceless entertainment and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time a final battle is inevitable as for the numerous battle scenes they are expertly done clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period everything is performed in an orderly but still quite gory fashion one side shoots then the other side then the remaining soldiers charge it s organized strategic and according to martin ineffective there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin s take no prisoners method what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington played wonderfully by jason isaacs tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians who nervously avoid eye contact this character is viciously evil he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home even his eyes are evil his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as cowardly and sadistic i disagree with this accusation tavington does not represent his country his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general besides tavington the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys heck why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down it s a lethal weapon for the colonial times god bless america and god bless the patriot 
sometimes i find th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to it s not the time or the distance it s the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy yet somehow the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story the wings of the dove fits the pattern kate helena bonham carter and merton linus roache are in love merton a newspaper writer would like to marry kate but kate s job if you will is to be a member of the british upper class her father lost all of her family s money but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man naturally a newspaper writer s wages don t count as rich kate leads him on but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder ultimately because he s not marriageable kate s american friend millie alison elliot stops in for a visit on her way to venice at a party millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie he might forget about her it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it he is still in love with kate and will accept no substitute the three of them along with a fourth friend elizabeth mcgovern end up on holiday in venice together where their interactions are quite complicated let s sum up millie has fallen for merton merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate kate loves him but can t marry him so on the one hand she s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy but on the other hand she s jealous of them as a couple a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick dying in fact at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies millie will leave her money to merton who will then be rich enough to marry kate she lets merton know of her schemes and since it will help him win kate he reluctantly agrees kate leaves venice so that the two m s can be alone together merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her he s not sure he can separate the two kate finds that she s not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved without revealing the details suffice it to say that the situation ends badly the title refers to the object of merton s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament one is left with feelings of regret and despair what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed anger and jealousy an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other and after a few things go wrong the whole idea seems like an awful life ruining mistake i wouldn t call the wings of the dove a film noir but the comparison is interesting as i have acknowledged before i am not a wonderful judge of acting but i liked the performances from roache and elliot roache successfully conveyed his character s ambivalence toward millie near the end he hugs her at first staring into space as if he s thinking about his plan with kate then giving that up to fully embrace millie millie s part didn t require as much range but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion their settings are far removed from my personal experience geographically historically and socially still the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over 
plot a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention the boys eventually get together to split the money but as plans change double crosses occur dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road who s on the up and up who s the real bad guy and who s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie critique the funnest movie that i ve seen so far this year it s got style it s got tough guys talkin shite and it s got plenty of bullets to go around a definite hunk a hunk a burnin adventure a guy s guy movie through and through and one that ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff it s not very original it goes on for a little too long but costner and russell make it happen as two shite kickin elvis lovers who don t stop till they more or less drop this movie s got some pretty intensive shoot out scenes one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i ve ever witnessed featuring several elvises with guns a blazin and the king s music playing in the background and a decent helping of double crosses sharp dialogue and funny moments in fact even though the cast is filled with many name actors b actors as they might be for the most part most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim but the true glue that holds this film together other than the spirit of elvis himself is costner and russell who play their badass characters to the t sure russell s been down this road before but costner surprised me with his nastiness i guess he s pissed at all the box office bombs that he s been in of late but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here in the end the bottom line with this movie is having fun kickin ass and making sure there s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards and smoke em if you got em folks there is also this one really great show down scene between costner and a cop that ll have you crackin up and lovin it all at the same time the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background with plenty and i mean plenty of camera tricks cuts and edits but for this kind of flick it actually works the film is not perfect though it starts off with a pretty big bang but then pulls a way of the gun on us and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle while characters intermingle and disperse i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega hot in the movie no okay well i just did i coulda done without her whole romance angle but to be honest it doesn t take up much of the film which is generally covered in blood explosions guts and elvis nods try to see how many inside connections to the king you can guess of course it s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind i also like these types of guy movies a lot and even though the film doesn t bring much originality to the table it does offer a pretty coherent story some nice twists and turns humor and a big ol helping of whoop ass coming straight from costner and russell s respective boots probably not a film for everyone but definitely for those who enjoy the guns the charismatic bad guys and a fun if entirely disposable adventure now see how many elvis songs i ve used to pun my way through this phony review below the elvis songs also recommend this movie so whether you re lonesome tonight or any other night remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets leave your little sister at home bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse cause this movie ain t one to return to the sender i really beg of you whether you re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender and no suspicious minds either folks cause i got stung by this movie i mean it really shook me up and unless you re the devil in disguise himself i think you won t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either so don t be cruel don t turn away don t curl up with your latest flame tonite whether she be a hard headed woman or not and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film it s now or never folks trust me i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i d seen so far this year is far behind me joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building thank you thank you very much where s joblo coming from get carter heat honeymoon in vegas payback reindeer games reservoir dogs way of the gun 
losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare while we all might feel the desire to blow someone s head off with a shotgun when they don t seem to grasp our point of view actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid this isn t the case with sam baily john travolta s slightly askew average joe persona in mad city i don t think people listen to guys like me sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum just a few days ago sam was a guard at this same museum but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position sam s apprehension resulted in a brash decision in an effort to get his ex boss museum director mrs banks blythe danner to just listen he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage sam s overall concern is valid enough if he loses his job his paycheck his benefits etc his wife and two children won t be provided for he s not a lunatic or a hot tempered madman he s somewhat like a child panicky compulsive and running on emotion and his naive intentions aren t helped any by the fact that banks wasn t overly compassionate with the let go overall he s just like you and me except that he has the capacity to view the line we d deem far enough as the starting mark of some crazy race meanwhile television reporter max brackett dustin hoffman is also on the scene covering a fluff story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest breaking news story he ever could ve hoped for having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting max is anxious to turn this into his and only his story max immediately bonds with sam max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone at first max s intentions don t stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor but as he gets to know sam more personally he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him the media however is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill the accidental shooting of ex co worker cliff bill nunn a black security guard becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam s honest ambitions also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts head of the news department of the station max falls directly under and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander who uses his network power to try and outshine max alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities then there is mia kirshner who plays the young tv station intern laurie she falls under max s wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting kirshner s credits are relatively small for now including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow still kirshner s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda bitchy in a reserved way roles i wouldn t mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy self righteous monster has indeed been tackled before mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors and seeing them together is a real treat they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both there is quite a bit of humor in this film and without it it could ve fallen into a drab cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause this isn t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart but it will lightly touch both making for a recommendable movie if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time i urge you to check this one out 
in some regards making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it try too hard and it snaps but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther in simon birch director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique he takes advantage of caution and poise but also risks his movie with a few bold steps in the end he s not only holding an unbroken band but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature there s no doubt about it the film that johnson has crafted is rich he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown maine leaves turn bright orange in the fall the grass is a lush green pure white snow falls in the winter and the sky goes on forever the characters continue that turn our two leads are simon birch ian michael smith and joe wenteworth joseph mazzello simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital and by age twelve he s only two feet tall joe is the bastard son of rebecca ashley judd and by age twelve he s ready to know who is father is naturally the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith simon birch is convinced that he s god s instrument and there must be a reason he s so small joe doesn t quite buy it but he sticks by simon the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other s only true friends early on the two meet up with ben goodrich oliver platt rebecca s new boyfriend and although the bond isn t immediate ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon a testament to the acting jobs of both finally jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show mark steven johnson s sense of drama and writing is fantastic the script is loosely based on john irving s novel a prayer for owen meany but it s so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from based on to suggested by along those same lines it s almost unfitting to compare the two johnson uses tension humor atmosphere and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity gump made over million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks but the winning idea remains the same simon birch is a different look at a different life and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come in the present however it s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at 
john sayles men with guns is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power the film takes place in an unnamed central american country where the men with guns are the rulers most of the country is divided into tiny segments some are controlled by guerrillas with guns some are controlled by army soldiers with guns and all the spaces in between are controlled by thieves bandits and terrorists all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness however like so many central american countries this one also features modernity there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization skyscrapers hospitals televisions highways etc but it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land or else they are simply ignorant of it the film s main character dr fuentes federico luppi falls into the latter category one of his patients an army general describes him as the most educated man he has ever met and also the most naive fuentes is a true liberal a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians with government assistance he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate this program was to be his legacy and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea however when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot g s he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned as he travels deeper into the forest going from village to village the story is always the same the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers usually for helping the other when dr fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors she replies simply because they had guns and we didn t rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns because others sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power dr fuentes picks up several companions during his journey all of whom are characterized by their loss first there is a young boy named conejo dan rivera gonz lez who has neither a mother nor a father next fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo dami n delgado who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities through his ordeal in the army domingo has lost most of his self respect and defines himself only by his pistol along the way the group also picks up padre portillo dami n alc zar a priest who has lost his faith as domingo is running from the army so is portillo he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer and ran away from the village in which he was preaching last the group takes on a mute girl named graciela tania cruz who hasn t spoken since she was raped two years earlier her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her sayles two major strengths as a director characters and setting are abundantly evident in men with guns like many of his films sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room but a longer than necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor he creates fascinating complex characters especially dr fuentes and domingo their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film s overarching theme of violence as power domingo s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes belief that the revolver is unloaded at first it is but later is isn t the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself sayles knows how to bring a location to life whether it be an early twentieth century coal mining town in matewan or a contemporary texas mexico bordertown in lone star sayles is not a particularly inventive director he likes to let his actors do most of the work but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak gattaca successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico using all latin american actors and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border it would not be a stretch to say that men with guns is a depressing film in fact the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure in addition to loss the main characters are also failures at something whether that be dr fuentes failure to change anything through medicine or padre portillo s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being nevertheless it is bleak material sayles has chosen and he deals with it accordingly the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope even in a world where as one character puts it nobody refuses the men with guns 
david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head it is one of many science fiction films released during the last year of this millenium that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future the story unfolds in a near future where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs the world of the future is an unfriendly place where the scared inhabitants are hiding in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world allegra geller jennifer jason leigh the leading game designer in the world is testing her new virtual reality game existenz with a focus group as they begin she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun she flees with a young marketing trainee ted pikul jude law who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard unfortunately her pod an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program is damaged to inspect it she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her the events leading up to this and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn t exist as the players are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game s perspective i don t intend to reveal more of the film s premise which is structured as a computer game with tasks that the characters must complete to win the game released after the matrix and dark city existenz has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films however existenz is moving in a different direction with a premise of its own a combination of dazzling special effects brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot made the matrix a rare and entertaining science fiction experience with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade existenz has a completely different atmosphere resembling dark city which is darker more serious and less entertaining existenz has the opportunities and potential but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored after the engaging beginning it starts to falter while i was watching the film many left the theatre during the first hour and indeed existenz seemed as a complete failure the actors seemed unreal the plot and dialogue silly unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level explaining all past events the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes and jet the film fails on several issues probably the best written character in the story is a game designer who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world than face real life this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg s script to the limits but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for it s a cold dark place where the players are forced to interrelate with unreal characters eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will it doesn t look like a place worth even thinking about david cronenberg has been the creator of the fly videodrome and the dead zone so it s not so hard to guess that existenz is a violent and gory film besides the regular murders of innocent people the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two headed mutated amfibium scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures the way i see it this is the film s crucial failure it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time space and problems of our everyday life do not exist a place of blooming blossoms green forests and clear waters a place really worth sacrificing your life for because of its lack of three dimensionality the film looses most of its possibilities but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes amusing performances especially by willem dafoe and one interesting and important thought depicted in many different ways throughout the movie during the film the audience is as confused as the characters detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created the matrix despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts ends with a light at the end of the tunnel existenz does not it is a one time experience ending in blood gore and madness a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow 
leonardo decaprio what s eating gilbert grape and claire danes tv s my so called life star in director baz luhrmann s modernized version of william shakespeare s classic romeo juliet surrounded by a superb supporting cast in cluding paul sorvino goodfellas brian dennehy tommy boy pete poslethwaite the usual sus pects and john leguizamo executive decision decaprio and danes shine throughout the film the story starts off at a gas station where the montague boys meet the capulet boys and square off with one another symbolizing the swords of shakespeare s day were their weapons like the rapier mm or the longsword shotgun instead of killing each other right away they shoot around just like in sword fights of old another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo s best friend mercutio who in shakespeare s novel was quite a stud was portrayed as an afri can american cross dresser whose violent na ture was a definite plus miriam margoyles a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet s nurse even though she was never given a name she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare s version only slightly changed in luhrmann s now known as verona beach the capulet s led by sorvino and montague s led by dennehy are now rival corporate dynasties and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue since it was spoken in old english sub titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie but toward the end it became easier to understand this excellent movie poses another prob lem what genre is it romeo juliet contains so much drama yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories with the same award winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction romeo juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece 
slavery is bad after hundreds of years we ve finally figured that one out this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg s latest serious film during the late s a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery fifty three of them are stuffed into the la amistad from a spanish word for friendship by their new spanish owners freeing himself from his chains senge pieh djimon hounsou renamed cinque by his masters leads a bloody revolt after killing most of the crew the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home or so they think instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property if they are property who do they belong to their masters the spanish government salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship the us government the defendants are pawns in several games abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard want to free them but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause their lawyer roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees south carolina senator john c calhoun arliss howard pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states president martin van buren nigel hawthorne is willing to force the result towards his own political ends when the verdict looks to free the africans van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes even that doesn t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims at the urging of calhoun the president then appeals the case to the supreme court populated by a majority of slave owners this little known try finding it in any history text book incident from america s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court the slavery issue is easy pickin s for spielberg much like his shindler s list which followed jurassic park as this follows lost world the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose nazis and slave traders both treat groups of others as less than human it s not hard to see who the bad guys are without that question to ponder the director s job is more difficult he has to make the story interesting spielberg succeeds for the most part the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle there are very few people in the tale in fact cinque is the only character who is fleshed out tappan and joadson are abolitionists symbols but not humans van buren is a weak politician but nothing else the rest of the slaves barely exist other than dressing for the set like many other films about people of color almost all the major players are white the film s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou the former model s first major role is a winner without speaking more than five words of english he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog the other stand out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents he also played the title role in nixon the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court room drama ever on the screen there are some other great moments especially impressive are the african s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant as grand as the epic is it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four star film michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some films 
after indecent proposal and up close and personal redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last redford may look great on screen but over the past few years he s proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen eighties and it was the first picture he helmed while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic realism with um realism and i ve never been much of a fan of a river runs through it to the chagrin of many quiz show was dazzling energetic and convincing the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery scott thomas plays annie maclean an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace johanssen loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi grace s horse survived but barely and has gone mad annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace s newly broken spirit eventually mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker redford a famed horse whisperer who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches leaving busy husband neill behind eventually they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom s family and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana including naturally tom the wise and lonely trainer the horse whisperer is delicately made i dare say lyrical since to many people s ear that word is synonymous with boring hardly the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch especially in the final third of the story scott thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell especially since d p robert richardson s photography casts montana as heaven on earth a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt emotive performance as the nice guy husband who is as authoritive and likeable as tom he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short cut for explaining away the cheating spouse s motivation unfortunately one of the horse whisperer s only flaws is the chemistry between would be lovers scott thomas and redford i liked both of them but i didn t necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish even if the countryside air thawed her slightly luckily and curiously this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn t quite matter their adultery seems like an afterthought the obligatory sub plot that ties many of the characters complex relationships together 
i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x files first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable you have to reach for a larger audience therefore the movie is quite user friendly altough non fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no i am not a fan of the x files i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium however since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the x files is what a summer should be exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank from start to finish this movie does not let go of you when i compare it with last summer s movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the x files is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the x files is a monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total no the x files is definately a mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much no this is mulder s time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you let s just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who cares if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies don t the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take a breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the x files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves a purpose who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attacks so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the x files is what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effects it s got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non fans will have a good time it does not provide answers to the show s many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah i never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half a star well i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop it s pretty obvious the film s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving 
most people fit into two different categories you either love woody allen or you hate his guts my family for the most part hates him and his movies i think he s very funny but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of unrestrained by physical boundaries allen s humor comes shining through those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen s intelligent observations of life those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one in a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they d never seen before toy story used state of the art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present many critics will call that a better film but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture antz however has upped the ante considerably disney s a bug s life isn t due out for another two months and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal by beating disney out they have satisfied the audience s thirst for computer animated films but don t let that fool you disney is definitely not scared in the past two years competitions have broken out between studios in it was the volcano duel in my opinion dante s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor both in time and in quality volcano had an original premise but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations in there are twice as many competing films first was the comet competition and armageddon blew away it s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact but now it s even more interesting as one beloved studio disney goes up against the newcomer dreamworks who will prevail time will tell but i m sure that mr mouse has nothing to fear this may sound like i didn t like antz on the contrary i d put it up there with toy story but due to it s pg rating many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn t appear in disney s version some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family oriented film sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally which makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd the humor is also written especially for adults though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended this is the type of film that should be made for families more often entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen s shtick and franz kafka s metamorphosis the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug z allen is a troubled ant believing he was not made to be a worker when you re the middle child in a family of five million he comments about his neglected childhood one night z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing his pathetic place in life in walks princess bala sharon stone whom no one recognizes without a crown bala asks z is he would like to dance and they engage in a pulp fiction esque dance while everyone else is following the leader after discovering that she is the princess z falls in love but there s a problem bala is getting married to general mandible gene hackman a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony in order to do that he must eliminate not only the queen anne bancroft but the weakest of the colony namely the worker ants but to get rid of the queen he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her he and colonel cutter christopher walkin come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle where they will surely be killed the queen is reluctant at first but decides it is best for the colony meanwhile z wants to meet bala again and he asks weaver an army ant to switch places with him so z gets sent off to battle but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites the battle sequence is absolutely stunning though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers which contained a very similar sequence however antz and that film were both in production around the same time so the similarities are merely coincidence the second half of the film revolves around z s kidnapping of bala and their search for a mythical place called insectopia there an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension especially one involving a magnifying glass looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day in fact i m just going to assume that the producers referenced id intentionally the ants look up in awe and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground visually it s an exciting rush of adrenaline but don t be fooled little kids shouldn t see this as they may just try and copy it after seeing antz i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again hopefully children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel as an animated film antz is probably the best you will find to date visually it s as stunning as what dreams may come the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren t limited by gravity they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball however the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy s shoe it s truly a great example of film making at its finest with computer technology the animators have carefully made the ants faces look similar to the actors providing the voices the best example would have to be barbatus danny glover at one point you can even see the pores on his face although i doubt ants have pores do they barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head but a good deal of humor is derived more appropriate for adults of course disney s a bug s life looks good but i don t know if they will be able to best dreamworks newest animated feature in terms of animation if not then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do go head to head with the big mouse and knock him down yes anastasia was good but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature and antz has one of the best line ups seen since toy story in fact it far exceeds that one woody allen has always been funny but here he transcends most of what he s done in the past few years without a body his comic timing is the most noticeable thing in fact i m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability though for the most part stone works best as a dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed up with stone once again is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor not a typecast action star after a snub at the oscars last year stallone is proving himself as the serious or comedic as illustrated here actor that he is gene hackman is superb as the gruff talking general almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns anne bancroft has a minimal role but she s effective nonetheless danny glover has a small role but he does a very very good job dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick euro trash bees both are very unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver although most people won t recognize her voice either many people will recognize grant shaud s voice as the foreman he played miles on the tv show murphy brown this is definitely a huge cast with some high profile names and it will definitely help it s grosses of course you can probably tell where a lot of the million budget went to also directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers though guterman did direct a feature headless but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture tense at times and very funny throughout the two hold this film together like professionals the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults kids will delight in the animation while parents can laugh heartily at the humor most of it will go over young children s heads does that mean you shouldn t take kids to see it not at all they will have a lot of fun watching this one what is great is the themes that are given to us part social commentary part romance story and part moral drama antz gives everyone something to talk about whether it be the animation or the discussions of individualism and community thankfully it s not subtle in either aspects antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie but the violence is what should keep kids at home the battle scene has ants melting in acid and bugs being speared to death and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight but other than that and some sexual innuendos it s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough but it s still advisable to leave really young children at home have i confused you enough if you do take your kids i recommend seeing the film with them because more than likely you ll enjoy it the most 
what if one of our cities became the target for terror what can we do what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster so far america has been the leading nation opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world it is the land of opportunities it is the land of freedom but what if it became the new target this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality when a special branch of the united states military under the command of general william devereaux bruce willis takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice the only warning the fbi receives is a single cryptic message release him then all hell breaks loose in new york a bus is destroyed killing civilians a broadway theater is bombed hostages are taken at a school as the wave of terrorist activity crests the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law devereaux argues against that eventuality but is nevertheless ready to lead men into action on american soil another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard denzel washington the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities his staff is comprised of smart energetic intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o f moronic feds we re used to seeing in movies hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft annette bening whose department knows more about the situation than they re willing to reveal but the attacks escalate the fbi are helpless chasing an invisible enemy the land is under siege they have lost control a terror is coming from within what s great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life it reflects reality and that s why it makes such an impact edward zwick has created a clever well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously and so his film plays on several levels never loosing focus on its main objective he is exploring the abuse of power the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u s government the army the fbi and the cia he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved the palestinian community in new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii there are concentration camps and unlawful interments all in the name of the greater good in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul freedom was that what the terror ists really wanted this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab american population in the u s and n y especially but to me these protests seem unnecessary zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys the script is therefore wonderfully balanced agent hubbard s best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad tony shalhoub is lebanese american and it is quite often you hear lines such as my first boyfriend was palestinian they seduce you with their suffering or they love this country as much as we do but no matter how you twist this matter you won t get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab speaking population who are in the great majority more to the point the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab americans by the u s military and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any way denzel washington is dashing as always in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage a network of snitches and seduction to gather information bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist hungry for power that never looses his connection with the audience since his point of view is not too hard to understand the film is elegantly shaped the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism he tightens the intensity as the events progress and when a plot twist comes it actually is surprising it is not a film drained in patriotism like the work of roland emerich nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey it has courage enough to get involved in politics it questions our foreign policies mentality and defense i must admit that it ends rather disappointing as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down but despite of that it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts a virtue that few summer films can boast of this is the

one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy s wedding and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald who hasn t made a worthwhile film since but the fact is betsy s wedding is also an alan alda film and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life written and directed by alda betsy s wedding is a vibrant slice of life mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor alda s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare as bride and groom molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film but they are by far the least interesting walsh is a nonentity with all the screen presence of a door knob ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain she looks hideous with her short cropped orange hair red lip stick and grotesque outfits she s supposed to be a dress designer but she looks more like a clown and to make matters worse ringwald s performance matches her appearance thankfully alda keeps ringwald s screen time to a minimum he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride s working class italian family and the groom s rich gentile family ringwald s folks are homey and down to earth with alda as her free spirited father madeline kahn as her practical mother and ally sheedy as her lonely sister walsh s clan on the other hand is prim proper and ostentatious when the two families meet and mingle the movie becomes a story of culture clash or as one character puts it money versus values ally sheedy in a wonderfully understated performance is one of the film s most pleasant surprises sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body it s anthony lapaglia however who seizes the spotlight lapaglia plays stevie dee a suave overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry lapaglia s sincere but dim witted character is a riot and what s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role model and partly a rip off i don t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re born but i do know that lapaglia s over the top performance should not be missed the scrumptious comic acting however extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia joe pesci in particular sinks his teeth into his role as alda s unscrupulous brother in law a slum lord with mob ties who is cheating on his wife catherine o hara alda faced with challenge of both directing and acting somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride s financially strapped father a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet the film adopts alda s psychological point of view as he tries to one plan the wedding and two pay for it as a filmmaker alda s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful and while he doesn t have the comic genius of a woody allen alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy 
 footloose has only one goal in mind to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel good antics and i hate to admit it i fell for it the movie is about a teenager bacon who moves to a small town from the big city and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend lithgow he ends up falling for the preacher s daughter singer and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do as mentioned at the beginning of this review footloose is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama there are virtually no surprises and the writing is second rate so why did i enjoy it so much for one thing the cast is great kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role we re rooting for him right from the start and unlike most films of this genre bacon doesn t play him as the rebel without a clue sort yes he does rebel but he s also polite when he needs to be and he never broods the rest of the cast is equally impressive john lithgow seen here playing a normal guy for a change is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter by the end of the film we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character another nice touch is the music we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with sexual innuendos but that s not true at all the title track performed by kenny loggins is upbeat and fun during the final sequence i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing of course i soon realized that would be a little pathetic anyway footloose is a charming little surprise don t let the premise prevent you from watching it it sucked me in and it ll do the same to you 
everyone s heard about this movie and more specifically the scene everyone s heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed no pun intended over and over and everyone s got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance good that s what you re supposed to do oh if you are one of the ones who hasn t seen this yet or you somehow haven t heard about what happens here s your spoiler warning deliverance was a real shocker for it s time major advances were being made in films and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry when it was first released it literally shocked the audiences it was something that for the most part had really never been seen on the big screen before among wide release films with an r rating but by today s film standards and in today s world such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn t as shocking although they can be even more graphic e g pulp fiction pulp fiction did it in a way and expanded on it in a way that it could even be interpreted as funny but in deliverance was no laughing matter the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory the initial leader of the group is lewis burt reynolds in his prime a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone type then any of the others joining him are ed jon voight bobby ned beatty and drew ronny cox the group s first objective is to find someone s to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip they make arrangements with a few mountain men who accept for the task drew also has the famous dueling banjos competition with a local who is let us say genetically challenged the men then set off down the river with lewis also the master at canoeing leading the way everything seems to be going fine until the two canoes split up leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone they encounter two hillbillies armed with a shotgun who captured them ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men ed nearly receives the same cruelty but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist s back the other hillbilly gets away and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film while attempting to make a quick paddle for it both canoes tip over drew who was without a life jacket was possibly shot and cannot be found lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition this leaves ed and bobby ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly alone with the bow and arrow the question arises if he will be able to handle himself as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer to which his comment i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing will have more meaning in the future deliverance is definitely a wild ride oops i m doing it again it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic it s definitely one of those must see movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade

you ve heard all the hype you ve seen all their faces natalie portman the professional as queen amidala liam neeson schindler s list as qui gon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotting as obi wan kenobi and jake lloyd jingle all the way as young anakin skywalker if you ve read any reviews you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy you also may have heard that this one s too kiddie friendly and doesn t have enough content for adults believe the hype the effects are stunning the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duels are amazing and queen amidala s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth but there s something missing here and it isn t budget or effects it s everything money can t buy the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters the most successful at this is liam neeson who as qui gon jinn a jedi master to young obi wan kenobi has quiet dignity and a wise commanding presence he is the anchor to this movie as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out portman s queen amidala and mcgregor s obi wan kenobi don t fare nearly so well amidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation comes off as stoic stilted and caricatured it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life and obi wan although mcgregor makes him very endearing has so little screen time that he s nothing but a robin to qui gon jinn s batman however mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity and he does a good job he also absolutely nails alec guiness obi wan in episode scottish accent and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise in fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit and that s one of the problems with this film i would never call myself a star wars fan especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days but i ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america however if you are the one person in america who hasn t seen the films at all or even recently or who doesn t bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters you may be hopelessly lost for example one of the film s main nefarious characters is senator palpatine for those of you not recently steeped in star wars trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader s master in return of the jedi and empire strikes back so obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful a lot of the movie is like that r d and c po make token appearances and it s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience s pre existing fondness for them because he doesn t do much to add to it in any way same goes for jabba the hutt who doesn t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy even planets make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strikes back and alderaan leia s home planet which we never actually see that gets blown up in star wars show up or are mentioned briefly in passing what s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty there s no meat no substance that makes you want to love the characters as they are not as they will be another problem is that there are actually too many alien characters in the film i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters had mouths that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual characters and jar jar binks a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended as comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast unlike chewbacca and c po who got their humanity if you ll pardon the expression from their interactions with the human characters jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles furthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot oddly this isn t just my judgment lucas has said that he designed this film for kids well he s done a good job the hero of this film of course is young anakin but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy that s not jake lloyd s fault though he does a good job of being a cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him that s another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader warning spoilers ahead in my opinion there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin s future evil in the film the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks and there s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie he has a doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn t all hearts and roses is yoda s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui gon jinn his explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead enter at your own risk of course the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul a scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts but has turned to the dark side this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup because qui gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force obi wan qui gon s young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself so at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begins with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker did this story need to be told i would say no but is it a worthwhile movie to see absolutely if you don t enter the theater with jedi size expectations and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler happier time above all this is a fun movie not deep not meaningful and not profound but fun maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct because if lucas does the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most potential 
did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra terrestrial i used to think that about my th grade english teacher ms carey but after seeing this movie they may have confirmed my suspicions as the story goes at any time there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth the men in black mib are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens guardians of our beloved planet from nasty tempered aliens and secret service to the stars based in new york city where weird is the norm the mib organization gives human form to our space faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed but to enforce the laws of earth the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast they carry other worldly technology to erase people s short term memory when common folk see the mib in action and their best leads on cosmic things gone awry are the supermarket tabloids little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v evil going on in the depths of space one of the aliens as human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious it holds the key literally to universal peace a giant cockroach like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this key in the wrong alien hands flippers mandibles tentacles it can be used as a weapon therefore it must be recovered and returned to it s rightful owners otherwise to ensure universal safety earth will be destroyed along with the key now it s the mib who must prevent this catastrophe the mib agents on the case are k played by tommy lee jones he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes he is accompanied by a flippant rookie j played by will smith but despite this shoot em up protect earth from destruction premise this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie and this isn t an independence day knockoff rather this is a stylishly offbeat sci fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies that there are real aliens that live here and that the government does its darndest to cover them up but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe there must be some kind of earth hangs in the balance scenario yet this movie is very appealing the abundance of wierdness talking aliens pee wee atomizers a mortician who lives for her work and lots of yucky bugs and slime splattering galore is played straight like as if this were normal of course we are in nyc it gives it a deadpan feel which makes it all the more funnier and odder jones plays the venerable seen it all agent with seriousness and maturity smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones straight man routine they click like dorothy s ruby red shoes the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld the addam s family this guy has a knack for gothic comedy and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen and an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors the story moves well and before you know it the end credits are already rolling the result is minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs aaaahhhs and wows let the men in black protect and color your world 
 pleasantville taps into hollywood s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed www pleasantville com april friday cast tobey maguire reese witherspoon william h macy joan allen j t walsh jeff daniels mpaa rating pg for sexual content and thematic elements genre drama in my opinion in short it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film one can easily be misled as to what the real message is review in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life such as rain fire or emotions the town of pleasantville has one adjective pleasant there is no sadness no fear no danger no discomfort no love and no hate put simply it s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for j one big note however is that it is only a s sitcom that airs in reruns on an oldies tv station or is it i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back more times in the period it endured at the box office but it wasn t until months later when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy dollar theaters after not having seen it for so long that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some healthy immorality is not a world at all instead the actual message which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of is that a world without immorality doesn t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself because everything is automatically right there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made no space for growth and never anything new to learn and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story now i m not saying that s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white it s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more a truly intelligent addition to it all however is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork that said the plot goes as such david and jennifer are two very s high school twins with the typical relationship outline of don t mess with my life and i won t mess with yours they demonstrate the well known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today david is the shyer subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv while jennifer is the wild licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home nevertheless jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed and as said earlier not to flip the town around into some corrupt society but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place people got hurt they cried they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves and that s when their physical world turned colors as well this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie but to me the message is finally clear i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run we ll never know what we could have done better until the next great movie i see i remain sincerely danielle flynn imr 
in my review of there s something about mary i said something to the effect of laughter isn t everything i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate laughter isn t everything unless i m watching a jim abrahams film see spoofs are easy with me i love movies and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love sometimes i m the only one in the theater laughing sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high pitched in comparison to my speaking voice it cuts right through everyone else s laughter sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film abraham s latest film mafia induced this kind of hysteria upon me it s gotten some mediocre reviews but hey i m the guy who laughs at everything there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film but there are far more that work and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought provoking most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things like develop characters shape stories and other such nonsense mafia has no pretentions about characters or story and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh the film begins on the perfect high note with a mockery of the opening of casino our hero jay mohr is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire to describe the story of mafia is absurd and pointless but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films with a lot of casino references inserted throughout along the way the parodies seem arbitrary and rarely victimize mob films pictures like the english patient forrest gump and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing movies like this rely on just a few things but the most important element is direction abrahams has been down this path many times before hot shots top secret airplane and any other film with an exclamation point in the title and so i hold most of the success of mafia to his experience he takes just the right attitude in each scene and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic but it never develops the actors are all energetic which helps a lot with the tone of the film mohr suicide kings paulie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors is so good here he looks like he s having so much fun that he s containing his laughter in every scene watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool he s probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando s godfather while pamela gidley is dead on in a full blown mockery of sharon stone the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i m supposed to give examples of things and be specific unfortunately i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia that i can t remember a lot of what made me laugh but that s a good sign mafia is so funny that i wasn t even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain i know that doesn t sound particularly complimentary but when watching a dumb comedy like this the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain finally a film that does this for me 
jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled kevin smith s greatest hits for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smith s earlier works including clerks mall rats chasing amy and dogma so be advised bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith s latest outing kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature most notably miramax the studio whose subsidiary dimension films is jay and silent bob s distributor others deserving accolades include ben affleck matt damon directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas this is a laugh filled foul mouthed road film with jay jason mewes and silent bob smith hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax s production of bluntman and chronic comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers jay s convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing but rather their comic book counterparts no matter the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker played by george carlin who tells them to follow the book the rules of the road of course jay s interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun carrie fisher who offers them a ride jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie s weaker aspects which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell can be easily tolerated really how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van and jay has a pot induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne the movie s highlight though is near the finale in hollywood jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck damon picture good will hunting hunting season here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other s careers and film choices and the laughs continue to grow next up is jason american pie biggs and james dawson s creek van der beek the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles finally comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature this bit will leave you howling smith s obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers he allows them to play it all tongue in cheek their fun comes through the screen to the audience it is too bad that this is jay and silent bob s swan song the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks but smith realizes that times have changed and he doesn t want his creations to overstay their welcome so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit saving the best for last goodbye jay and silent bob at least you re going out with a blast 
synopsis in this cultural exploration a chinese american computer engineer named fang peter wang decides to take a month long vacation to visit his sister mrs chao shen guanglan her husband mr chao hy xiaoguang and their teenage daughter lili li qinqin in beijing after years of separation fang brings his asian american wife grace sharon iwai and his college aged son paul kelvin han yee along both of whom don t speak chinese the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters opinion sometimes a film is plot driven sometimes it s a character sketch a great wall can be called a culture sketch as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family fang s family is thoroughly americanized fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss his wife can t cook chinese his son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl meanwhile fang s beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the work unit her husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of american depravity homosexuals running the streets and her daughter lili longs for american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance exams is the most important thing in life the two families spend a month slowly learning about each other there is no ultimate answer or final comprehensive understanding after the month long vacation the film is neither here nor there it s a neutral meandering gentle portrait of life on both sides 
in director brett ratner and his stars jackie chan and chris tucker breathed new life into the buddy action film genre with the cross cultural rush hour to the tune of about million you don t mess with success so the team is back again and better in rush hour the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in rush hour that played well to audiences around the world the formula worked so well in fact that the sequel was inevitable i m never thrilled with the idea of a follow up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations surprisingly rush hour wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it the script by jeff nathanson utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film wastes no time getting to the point right from the start terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong killing two american translators and chief inspector lee jackie chan is handed the job of solving the crime concurrently his friend james carter chris tucker arrives on the island for some much needed r r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights instead lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars the makers of rush hour are working at a distinct advantage over the original we the viewer are familiar with the two lead characters and the already existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around that chemistry was a high point and probably the saving point before and now the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in rush hour first and foremost to me in rh is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan s artistry in fight choreography the year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and here he does not disappoint chan s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand such as a trash bucket his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding on the tail end of a yacht in a hong kong massage parlor and for the finale in a las vegas casino like harold lloyd or buster keaton chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop carter who teams again with lee to put down the bad guys when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case he still looks to have some fun when lee goes into a karaoke bar the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan john lone and his hoods carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and with jackie chan has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills the combo of chan s flying feet and fists with tucker s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the lethal weapon films the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently john lone as ricky tan is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign alan king in a walk through performance lone doesn t chew scenery or make pronouncements to get lee and carter but gives the chief bad guy elegance zhang zi yi crouching tiger hidden dragon continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky s taciturn henchlady hu li who carries on an ongoing battle with carter carter has a problem through most of the film with hitting a woman but this falls aside with their eventual one on one melee at the conclusion roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous and resembles sandra bullock as undercover agent isabella molina she doesn t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch director ratner and the original rush hour production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera cinematographer matthew f leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives rh the fluid camera movement the genre film needs production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino the rest of the techs are of the same high quality i m surprised to even say that rush hour is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out so far this summer i give it a b 
one of the last entries in the long running carry on series carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a caravan site professors anna vrooshka elke sommer and roland crump kenneth williams and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep kenneth connor so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick for instance when anna is asking for scrubbers for dirty caravan she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan arthur upmore bernard bresslaw and his wife linda patsy rowlands take her mother daphne barnes joan sims and her minah bird on holiday with them mother in law jokes prevail furthermore the trouble that joe and norma baxter ian lavender and adrienne posta have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families fred ramsden windsor davies and ernie bragg jack douglas leave their wives liz fraser and patricia franklin behind for a fishing holiday however they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls sandra carol hawkins and carol sherrie hewson the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day to day running of the camp the search for the minah bid and greyhound the major fred and ernie s desperate need of a woman a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park s pub and a shock in store for daphne the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing this is what binds the movie together joan sims stands out as the demanding mother in law bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast on the other hand there are low key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors although the regular cast is depleted the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film a relative flop at the cinema this movie deserves a lot more recognition 
the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas has made the film out to be a comedy and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one it s and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash outs among them journalist raoul duke johnny depp and his attorney dr gonzo benito del toro these two spend most of the film in a drug induced stupor having strange hallucinations trashing their hotel rooms and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas but gets lost in a blur of drugs beer and flying dust and ends up wandering around with no clue who won he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate to cover a drug enforcement conference fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs it doesn t even in the beginning while the pair s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first the humor here is still fairly dark director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye and even when we re laughing we re laughing at them rather than with them they spend most of their time paranoid angry or just plain befuddled which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen but it s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first hand all this aside i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one hour mark thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off kilter satire of drug culture thankfully the script delivers it before too long as duke in a rare moment of lucidity stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie riding the wave of something that seemed special and important now it s six years later and the wave has finally broken as he puts it materialistic culture is still alive and well and for most of this film right in his face in las vegas the american dream of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever the social protesters have lost and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment in many ways fear and loathing is gilliam s most reality based film all of his others with the exception of the fisher king have made use of some sort of fantasy or science fiction plot elements yet it is his off the wall masterpiece brazil to which this film bears the most visual resemblance the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks and similarly duke s world is composed of the artificial empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations unlike the protagonist of brazil however duke is not a particularly admirable figure and neither is gonzo during the latter half of the film their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress while duke though he doesn t seem to approve doesn t do anything to stop it either by the time this scene takes place they don t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner duke seems to realize at some level that he s become something he doesn t like but he s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places i think he and his co writers deserve more credit than that there s plenty of substance here particularly in the second half its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the s and the objects of their rebellion just aren t usually very pleasant unlike say brazil or the fisher king both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment fear and loathing in las vegas shows us someone who s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs in its own psychedelic whacked out way it s sad and regretful but i think it s also a bit of a kick in the pants a challenge to find an alternative between chemically induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas style materialism indeed duke himself admits at one point that he s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them i m not sure if he s any closer to accepting it by the end or not but i suspect the audience will get the idea 
kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow and you instantly know what he s thinking detective story features one of kirk douglas s finest performances he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night the film is based on a play and this is quite evident as most of the movie takes place in the one room flat that the detective s work in the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife but through a series of events he never quite makes it there the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate however this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas s wife a connection douglas himself is not aware of many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film secrets i would not dream of giving away with a name like detective story one would assume the film would resemble an episode of nypd blue but it doesn t quite work out that way however we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time lee grant virtually unrecognizable plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting her scenes with bendix another detective provide the movie with a few laughs the performances all around are fantastic douglas may be the leader of this ensemble but he s not the center of attention all the time we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases which brings me back to douglas he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime but has finally realized that what he s really done is gotten back at his criminal father how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don t seem to see to much of these days he s a tough guy but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior 
playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare s works they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare i mean really who doesn t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare and despite the difficulty of their task they have succeeded shakespeare in love is one of the smartest funniest most touching films of the year it s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors but here we have a movie that defines success it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written it could have been a smug self important movie that panders to die hard shakespeare fans but the appeal of this film is almost universal if you ve ever read a play by shakespeare or know anything about his life it s likely that you ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love joseph fiennes brother of ralph stars as shakespeare himself he s a delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly with women and detached from life s more serious problems debt plague etc he s commissioned to write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann tom wilkinson shakespeare however has trouble focusing on his work he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel this all changes however when he meets viola de lesseps a radiant gwyneth paltrow a young heiress set to marry the financially oriented lord wessex colin firth shakespeare instantly falls in love with her he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo he discovers her identity and confronts her later she of course falls in love with him although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare s writing so much and soon the production which later becomes romeo and juliet is set to be performed shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film not because it works as great entertainment but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role he has such searing optimism and energy he s clearly a man who admires shakespeare and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character inability to turn away from women attention deficit disorder we sense a great deal of affection and care he practically overflows with passion in every scene fiennes is matched by paltrow whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i ve seen her in the two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh of course it doesn t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with stoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor all of his plays have similarly dry humor the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play in the movie shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director i m going to have to see the movie again i m certain there are numerous references that i missed in fact i doubt it s possible to gather everything with just one viewing stoppard is a master of detail you ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film not as lines of a play but as dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time there s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe s mysterious death in a pub there s also a scene featuring a wide eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing there s no dog in this play no no dog the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe wilkinson is also hard to recognize but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously ben affleck playing one of the actors in the company shows great range both in his accent his is almost as good as paltrow s and in humor he has some of the best one liners in the movie colin firth always stuck playing the sap does a good job being hateful judi dench however has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words my single minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end the story is moving but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes but my quibbling is not important what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture the sheer skill with which it has been written acted and produced shakespeare in love tries so many things and nails every one of them it s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him a film in which the actors writers and director are all perfectly in sync it s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare s work in a positive way without seeming condescending or superior i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it 
shakespeare you hardly understood it in high school why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn t count on it if this is your attitude then i ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh s hamlet is probably not for you and you might as well stop reading right now if however you are a lover of the bard or at the very least are open minded about a challenging script read on for there is something rotten in the state of denmark namely the king has died and his widow the queen has wed the king s brother claudius but prince hamlet suspects foul play his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother s hands hamlet enlisting the help of his friend horatio conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery and the game is afoot the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers the hamlet castle s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings mirror panel doors and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second story loft costuming is equally grand drawing upon both history and imagination not quite the denmark of the s the characters attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars respectively in addition to directing kenneth branagh also plays the title character as the revenge driven royal heir branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows from the anticipation of seeing his father s ghost to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester to his eventual wrath branagh delivers in spades every scene truly revolves around hamlet as much a tribute to branagh s acting and directing as to shakespeare s manuscript hamlet seems to be a who s who of shakespearean trained actors so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself julie christie as hamlet s mother gertrude and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly as do many of the supporting players kate winslet as hamlet s lover ophelia does an outstanding job demonstrating the character s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness richard briers as ophelia s father polonius and michael moloney as her brother laertes are equally convincing nicholas farrell as hamlet s trusted friend horatio and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible in some cases this made for interesting scenes billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick whom hamlet knew quite well crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian and the result is a very funny scene however charleton heston whom many might think would butcher shakespeare is the biggest surprise of all as the player king the leader of a troupe of traveling actors he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story with sir john gielgud and judi dench but this is most unfortunate for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time his off camera speaking while gripping sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well voiced actor i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out and let the venerable actor have the attention unfortunately there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions jack lemmon an excellent actor just can t do shakespeare as marcellus the guard who sees the elder hamlet s ghost lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him gerard depardieu another talented actor is wasted when given little more than the utterances of yes my lord and no my lord in the role of reynaldo richard attenborough has a literally walk on role showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador i think he had two lines then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback type images this only works about half the time and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them you don t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar the high school english course in it you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king s english or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes 
before you read my review you gotta know that i love woody allen this is a very important note because allen s films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius while others see him as a dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again i love most of his films but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the s in fact why he felt the need to make movies in those years is beyond me if you look at the quality of those films you ll hear what i m saying the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives in fact i secretly hoped that he would take some time off at the turn of the millennium just to re energize or something but it doesn t appear as though he has any intention of doing that so here i am again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old plot the year is and woody allen is a top notch insurance investigator his methods are very old fashioned and apparently out of date a new employee hunt has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency the two do not like each other one night they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician and unbeknownst to them placed under his control soon thereafter jewels are stolen words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer critique a wonderful recreation of the s style movies with the fast talking witty banter between co workers a catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements such as the veronica lake type sexpot one liners galore and a fluffy if inconsequential plotline on the downside the film actually starts off pretty slowly with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy the sets on the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man but it wasn t not long before i was fully engaged by the characters entertained by the many zingers delivered back and forth between allen and hunt and actually interested in the resolution of the flick i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old parody and actual reinvention note theron s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool of course films like this with little or no real tension in the plot need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick fire dialogue and once again allen does a great job in playing his character who for once isn t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude he actually plays a macho guy here and handles it pretty well especially the scenes in which he s hypnotized but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt an actress who i was openly sick of seeing in movies late last year sorry babe you were just in too many at the same time anyway she s really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men and doesn t miss a beat of allen s fast paced dialogue i didn t care much for her running joke about him dying whenever he left a room but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did yum yum harumph but i digress so let s recap a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score some funny one liners especially in the second half a decent plotline although you shouldn t expect a real mystery or anything and some solid acting all around i can t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen s best work but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through it s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute old school kind of vibe with chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion little known facts about this film and its stars annie hall celebrity everyone says i love you husbands and wives mighty aphrodite small time crooks when harry met sally you ve got mail 
a cinematic version of one of john irving s novels is always cause for celebration even if as in the case of simon birch the treatment is merely suggested by rather than strictly based on the book suggested means that irving author of the acclaimed the world according to garp sold the rights to his novel a prayer for owen meany to the disney machine for million but wouldn t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names that s an odd decision irving claims it s to protect both himself and the novel but it s one that doesn t unduly harm the finished product irving s books are rich and complex works full of intriguing colorful characters a prayer for owen meany is no exception it tells the story of an unusual boy called simon birch in the film version who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high pitched falsetto voice like strangled mice simon believes himself to be god s instrument placed on this earth to somehow effect god s plan simon is played by ian michael smith who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which among other things prevents bones ligaments and joints from developing normally smith s debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for simon birch however the producers unwisely favored form over function smith s acting abilities are limited at best another drawback is that in the book simon s condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters in careful loving detail watching simon birch however creates a different feeling altogether the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character surely something irving would not have intended simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating a combination of smith s rookie status as an actor and the precocious one liners he s forced to deliver courtesy mark steven johnson the film s director and screenwriter fortunately simon birch isn t the real star of the film that bears his name simon is more of a catalyst allowing his co stars to shape the story and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances saving the film from an obsequious manipulative destiny first and foremost is joseph mazzello jurassic park who is nothing less than remarkable as simon s best friend joe mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a year old ripe with laughter pain and tears he is certainly an emerging talent ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca joe s single mother and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend ben david strathairn and jan hooks play the town s reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others there s even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from well that would be telling perhaps suggested by the novel is the appropriate way to go after all since simon birch only focuses on one chapter one year of simon s extraordinary life the film also changes the book s ending to one that is more melodramatic yet necessary given simon s lot the flavor of irving s original novel remains however the passions friendships and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown maine and the engaging oddballs both big and small who reside there 
all those who were offended by there s something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch and while this uproariously funny gross out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage targeted fare this season i must question the studio that releases a movie like this the producers are aiming these films at the crowd but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r rated film some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie american pie was threatened with an nc but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product it was given an r but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park it is sick perverse and ultimately disgusting not to mention extremely funny american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night jim jason biggs kevin thomas ian nicholas oz chris klein and finch eddie kaye thomas are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base to which one of his friends replies like warm apple pie of course this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner there are many moments such as this in which director paul weitz uses a game plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief american pie is a hard fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it i loved the young cast in this movie consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects and you should appreciate their performances biggs is more than enjoyable and chris klein who recently played a similar jock in election is obviously a young talent on the rise but in a teen dominated movie the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy of television s sctv who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim s uneasy father scenes in which the familiar father son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie after levy discovers jim s new use for apple pie he tells him i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age but i never used baked goods it is performances such as his and bill murray s in rushmore that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out there are some less than original aspects of the film a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex lax is something we ve seen before if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers then this is a decidedly unwise move the same prank was pulled in the brother s dumb and dumber and used to greater effect secondly the characters are forced into a half hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing but at one point in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it s own biggs asks his buddies why he s going through so much pressure for something that s not very important anyway and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate it still manages to be mature in it s own way 
the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest little caper adventure entitled where the money is the elderly bank robber is henry paul newman a famous criminal that was only recently caught he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune always the shrewd thinker he begins working on a plan to get out of jail this involves years of studying buddhism and self hypnosis when he is prepared to execute his plan he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke now a seemingly twitching vegetable he is temporarily transferred to a state run home carol linda fiorentino is the nurse that cares for him she s a very bright person with a good heart yet her life is a miserable waste of time the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics worse she s in a dead end relationship with high school sweetheart wayne dylan mcdermott they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom to her this made sense long ago but now it s a different story wayne seems equally bored with his life but is content enough to stay put wayne s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients but she s never been anywhere else and doesn t see many other opportunities in life however when henry falls under her care her outlook begins to change the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke carol however begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all maybe she can get through to him and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away the opening minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry back to life and what are some of carol s resuscitation techniques perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses if that fails maybe she ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a foot high pier into the cold lake below when he finally comes out of his state of self trance the movie s direction changes though it remains equally if not more entertaining carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self assuredness she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy this of course puts wayne in an odd situation henry and carol s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash meanwhile this is carol s ticket to a better life wayne is uncomfortable with the situation but helps out nonetheless however his lack of commitment threatens their success the heist sequence is suspenseful well paced and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong where the money is does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist newman is the real joy of the film adroitly showing that at age he s still really hot stuff he possesses a sly smile displays a dominating attitude and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive fiorentino is also a fun presence you root for her despite her sense of amorality sure she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair stricken man into a lake but we can see that to escape her dead end world she needs to do something drastic with two charismatic characters such as these it s hard to ignore that where the money is is where the fun is 
with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up loading their guns kissing each other and uttering what sounds like rock and roll actually it s lock and load you can t help thinking tarantino and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie clyde to natural born killers but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon inspired by true events we ve heard that one before and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated or so strangely poignant for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged beginning with their final arrest the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris luke perry a policeman and pam ashley judd a factory worker they fall in love and marry but pam s increasingly erratic behaviour going on spending sprees slashing herself with a knife after an argument begin to trouble the solid and stable chris when chris gets sacked they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up then chris begins to rob banks luke perry accomplishes the not inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills or buffy the vampire slayer moustached with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation he is perfectly cast as the long suffering husband it s another of john mcnaughton s coups of casting against type after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person if the performance falls short of greatness however it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema whether it s in betty blue tom viv or georgia as in those movies there s the danger that the performance seems mannered a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece judd doesn t entirely avoid this pitfall but pam s craziness is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more normal chris when pam reacts to her father in law s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones chris face is the picture of pained restraint of course it s the question of what is normal that is asked in normal life mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity it is the rational chris that loves guns shooting is about precision control and the crazy pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog who is then called chaos chaos and you and me we re a real family she notes wryly it is chris methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber his well planned disguise as a bearded roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background buy more the perfectly respectable consumption crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases and both of them into desperate situations it s not a perfect film some of the dialogue is a touch too banal perhaps intentionally the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film indeed as in mcnaughton s seminal film henry portrait of a serial killer it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre that gives this determinedly unflashy moving film its great strengths mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet coolly realistic method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer the suburbs with their miles of white fenced houses and identikit malls take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness in its very different way this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick s badlands while pam shares the yearnings of malick s heroes to escape from ordinary life chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a normal life their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies but these are dreams defined by constrained by and even doomed by the limitations of the normal conventional world pam s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs where wild bushes grow symbolically the frontier the outer limits of her society but also quite literally the end of the road where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement the flying inkpot s rating system wait for the video a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
 being john malkovich is the type of film we need to see more today s films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas or those that have similar themes malkovich falls under none of these categories and it s quite refreshing to see that occur this strangely provoking story is actually somewhat understandable john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time his wife cameron diaz supports the both of them by working at a petstore which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job he finds an ad for a filing clerk when he reaches the building he arrives at a floor it s there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for minutes at a time meanwhile cusack meets a business partner catherine keener in which he falls madly in love with her the only problem is she has no interest in him what so ever the whole portal thing isn t just a toy in fact it becomes cusack s dream being inside malkovich s mind gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich like a puppet and to fulfill his fantasies i don t want to give away too much but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery in my opinion this idea is absolutely brilliant it s really quite scary to think that someone could become you control you be you it makes you wonder why we act like we do and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue even if the script is super sharp i can t help but find the ending displeasing it could have lead up to something more or at least an amusing conclusion it tried to explain a mythology about the portals that made it seem rushed other than that i had a very enjoyable time the acting was quite delightful as well john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability and he does it well he s by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity but i m hoping that will change cameron diaz was her usual charming self although i felt that part was wrong for her but she pulled it off john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice who else s mind would be better to explore the director spike jonze who appeared in last month s three kings really catches my attention with this project i knew he was bizzare but not to this extreme he too is likely too receive media attention being john malkovich isn t an excellent film but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite what s even better is the film s puzzling message am i nick lyons 
the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it s adequately explained by the commercials with days to go until the election the president who we never see calls in political dirty tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a pageant a phony war against albania fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville with woody harrelson as the reluctant psychotic hero and if there wasn t anything more to the movie than this it would be a second rate heist comedy at best enlivened by great actors like sneakers goes to washington a heist comedy yup deniro and hoffman are stealing the election so to speak and the movie is more about how they do it and the fun they have doing it than anything else wag the dog succeeds because it s based one great truth the american people are stupid ok maybe it s not love thy neighbor as thyself or even two plus two makes four but a truth nonetheless any average person who thinks that they re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes moviemaking and the political process is invited nay challenged to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or hours straight watching c span when the house is in session and because we re so utterly predictably stupid hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo washington knows that we won t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies and deniro s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won t be able to locate albania on the map the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn t a light meaningless comedy about politics like speechless the michael keaton geena davis picture or from the level of light hearted politcal satire to near greatness nor is it a hard edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally deprived ethically challenged baby boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house like primary colors and yes i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out thanks for asking instead david mamet s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers schemes come off beautifully and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables without any of the violent rages it s all what do i love what is it that brings me joy baseball minus the savage bloody beating with the bat he threatens a lot of people mind you but he s doing it in a very nice polite way it s a very mellow restrained performance which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script hoffman on the other hand is giddy exuberant and joyous this kind of thing is what his character lives for and he s so excited that he can t even shut up even on the edge of disaster he s bright eyed behind oddly tinted sunglasses and positive insiders note that he s basing his character on some powerful but anonymous producer which may or may not be true but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets put on a show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them listen to them talk in that wised up mamet dialogue get to know them better which we don t anne heche is dead bang on in her portrayal of a political press aide cool and composed on the outside panicked and frenzied on the outside denis leary one of my favorite actors see the ref is the fad king who handles the profitable back end t shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative innovative ways to separate a fool from his money they could make a whole movie just about the fad king and i d go see it willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song to the weepy country waltz to the hilarious ballad of the green berets parody woody harrelson has a brief but memorable part as the overmedicated hero of the albanian conflict craig t nelson as the opposition candidate and the ever reliable william h macy as a wacky cia agent are given surprisingly short shrift one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems the trivialization of american politics the role of the press in dumbing down the issues the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars the list goes on we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don t 
plot a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum as each day passes the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion saying anything else about the plot would be a crime have fun critique i feel like shooting myself in the head are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here this ain t your average happy go lucky kind of picture this is a deliberately slow paced mystery horror film drenched in atmosphere with a very creepy insane asylum in which most of the film takes place very few clues up front and lots to talk about afterwards will it bore some people to sleep you bet it will is it made for the scream audiences of the day absolutely not i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the cerebral crowd a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame giving away very little with each step and each sound unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later i ve always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group in fact i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a mindfuck if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together well then this movie is definitely for you it s the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate damn i missed that whole peanut butter thing and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark brrrrrrrrr now what was that sound in the basement honey can you go check and one thing this film doesn t have unlike its hollywood ian counterparts like the haunting is special effects in fact that s one of the greater things about this movie it feels real because it looks like it s actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances i did some research and it was in fact shot on digital video ah ha another great thing about it is that it s actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen it s mostly implied kids and as clich d as it might be to say it s usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such other films that this one reminded me of include henry portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project with that same real sense of dread brooding and terror the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don t get into it completely you really need to concentrate here you will lose the motion of the story and the pent up tension might be released but overall this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can how can you go wrong definitely not a film for everyone but a must see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed count me in stanley kubrick would be proud oh yeah so where s that gun again where s joblo coming from the blair witch project blair witch the haunting the house on haunted hill lost highway the pledge the shining the sixth sense unbreakable 
i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials but there isn t george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effects bound flicks and he has done it again this is the first star wars film i ve seen on the big screen so of course the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story but its amazing visuals basically the film s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets qui gon liam neeson and his young apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor set out with the animated jar jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war when their ship breaks down and they are stranded they find a young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his slave mother qui gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing anakin participates in a heart pounding podrace one of the highlights of the film to get the equipment needed to fix qui gon s ship however most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy meanwhile queen amadala natalie portman is frustrated and at wit s end being na ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made in all the star wars films human emotions that we the audience can identify with are usually nil but the films are for pure enjoyment not for uplifting purposes despite the fun of watching the movie the phantom menace is not without flaws for starters we have the ill conceived moronic character jar jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience what a klutz george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as say yoda r d or c po but alas his efforts were in vain secondly this may be good or bad depending on your point of view the movie s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic book feel of the previous three star wars installments this is due perhaps to the utter complexity to this movie s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions i can t say much about the acting though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway however there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and at times stale natalie portman has a great presence but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic unfeeling enigma there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk despite the inevitable faults there is so much to enjoy about the movie the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes but they are amazing and edge of your seat fun in their own rite the film is a treasure to look at the visual effects are astonishing of the time the awe inspiring mouth opening eye popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius not since s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element the previous star wars movies kubrick s maybe even of fritz lang s classic silent metropolis however all the sets are so original the original star wars movies can t even match the grandeur of this film s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode the costumes are remarkable and have jean paul gaultier written all over them whether its queen amadala s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold embroidery and feathers or the jedis simple brown uniforms the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie as for john williams score i don t think he s done one as complex or powerful since i can t even remember it is as epic as his schindler s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films but williams has added on made the music much more intense and moving what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed there is very little to hate in the film it s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick it is the best fun film and the best big budget film out today most definitely 
in the muse albert brooks plays steven phillips a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio they claim that he s lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over so he turns to his best friend jack jeff bridges another screenwriter who s enjoyed success after success on the way over to jack s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman sharon stone into a cab and begins to think is he having an affair when confronted jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is in fact a muse a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity and has helped him garner his success she doesn t do any actual writing he is told but inspires you steven is excited by what he s hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she ll take steven on as a new client jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present preferably something from tiffany s after the meeting the muse sarah decides to take on steven but at a price she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her like bringing her salads in the middle of the night steven s wife andy macdowell sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon steven confesses everything and although at first suspicious she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he s going through for her and that s a question only time will tell the muse is albert brooks sixth film as writer director actor he co wrote with monica johnson and although it s a good movie it s not up to the level of his best works defending your life and mother the problem lies in the script and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor there aren t nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one liners it has a great premise but doesn t deliver up to it s full potential but i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit he may whine and complain but he just wants to support his family and be happy and i like sharon stone in this movie too it s a nice change of pace for her and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner james cameron and martin scorsese and although the muse doesn t have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman s the player i still left the theater feeling good and that s something i wish i got out of more movies 
so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton but they just don t get the good grades so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide the remaining roommates will get an automatic chris michael vartan and tim matthew lillard are two guys who really want the to get into harvard how far will they go to get their chris and tim are also roommates with rand played by randall batinkoff the two scheme to murder rand make it look like a suicide so they can supposedly get their they have heard this rumor many places and they are willing to take the chance to find out rand is a very very mean person he treats his girlfriend natalie played by tamara craig thomas like she doesn t matter at all she is very afraid of him and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant she does tell him and he becomes enraged that night would be the last night of rand s life tim and chris give rand a bottle of rat poison making him think that it is beer rand drinks down the poison and then dies now tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself it does not take long until the suicide note is found but the body isn t found the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information feeling extreme guilt chris is having a very hard time especially with his girlfriend emma played by keri russell she wants to know more but he will not even speak with her will he give in will tim turn chris in will chris turn tim in will they turn themselves in all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film the events in the curve are very surprising original and fun the plot sounds much like dead man on campus but that is not the deal with this film this film is a very serious one with not many laughs there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying it is a terrific suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride the sound really stood out in the film it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film the way the movie is filmed is also great all of the technical aspects as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done the performances in the curve are very good matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role just like in s scream a he is very strange in this film as well i like him in this sort of role rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she s all that michael vartan is fantastic as chris who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed where he co starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student keri russell also gives a great performance she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film tamara craig thomas is also realistic especially coping with the death of her boyfriend some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case the bottom line i might just have to curve that a into an a note the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early it was decided the film would not be released widely it is now available at blockbuster video only and for rent only see you at the video store 
titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it s upsetting that it isn t the film which cost million to make and could of put th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it sunk pun intended is a labour of love for cameron who wrote and directed the film we all know that big budget dosen t mean great film see waterworld but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic but sadly titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece although it is one of cameron s best films the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic they find a safe and inside a picture of a woman the woman in the picture an old winslet tells the explorers that the picture is of her the explorers invite her over and she then tells her story of titanic in the flashback dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson who after winning a poker game wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic leaving liverpool to go to america also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater winslet who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen t love at all cal hockley zane so her family can remain rich she nearly commits suicide on the ship but jack comes to the rescue saves rose they fall in love and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them oh yeah and the ship sinks and that is the main problem with the film and which stops it from being a work of genius the story and script both by cameron are both weak the story is full of cliched characters the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry the poor boy with heart the stuck up mother and poor dialogue the script consists of lots of in jokes of how the boat won t sink and most of the dialogue is pretty basic it s a shame really as the audience does have to sit through hours of this film without good dialogue a film could become a very long very boring film like camerons own terminator but luckily there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear firstly there s cameron s direction there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end there is a lot of mayhem and panic all done very well by cameron it s a scary sight watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below thanks to cameron s direction then the audiences attention is held for the full hours minutes to support the directing are the excellent cast working very well with their underwritten characters dicaprio is good although he only looks years old his performance of a over excitiable yet also well mannered boy is excellent and he also has some funny lines winslet is great also and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth zane is deliciously evil as cal saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash the audience really does come to hate him he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he s in like dead calm but he does it really really well also worthy of note is kathy bates edward scissorhands as a loud mouthed american finally the icing on the great things cake are the special effects cameron is a whiz with effects just watch aliens terminator and true lies and they are used very well throughout the sweeps of the ships are awesome although digital domain who did the effects cannot animate human movement too well the humans seem to move to smoothly there s just something odd about them you can tell that they have been animated on a computer of course the ship sinking scenes are awesome with bodies flying all over the place and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film titanic then is a wonder of directing acting and cgi but not writing and story again like most of camerons films the editing is loose cameron edits himself and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts titanic then although not the godfather of movies it could of been is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius enjoyable scary and even sad titanic is a film cinema was invented for filling the screen with incredible images and assaulting the ears with awesome sound a superb film but sadly not perfect overall rating 
the long kiss goodnight r meryl streep tried it and failed even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well bared assets however geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband renny harlin davis plays samantha caine a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey samuel l jackson she slowly remembers and reclaims her past as charly baltimore tough as nails cia operative needless to say with the reappearance of samantha charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no goodniks out to erase more than her memory shane black netted a cool mil for his script i m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag but for what it s worth it delivers the goods like black s previous work such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny quirky dialogue the humor especially works well in this case for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously but there s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car while ice skating jackson and davis make a good team jackson is funny as ever as ever in fact his spirited line deliveries especially when he first appears are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction as good as he is the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis who shows much promise as an action heroine what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn t take herself too seriously she is obviously in on the joke slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation this is not to say that she doesn t need work sometimes she lays on the toughness a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature but should the public embrace the film and in turn the notion of a kick ass female davis could have found her special niche it seems as if davis and harlin s first collaboration the middling pirate epic cutthroat island was just a dress rehearsal albeit a very costly one for long kiss in which the wife husband team hit their action stride anyone simply looking for a fun escapist entertainment that requires little to no thinking will find this film to be a more than welcome kiss 
my filmcritic com colleague norm schrager nailed session brad anderson s throwback to spooky horror films from the s it worked as an eerie homage without being self referential or smugly postmodern genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick s the shining and george romero s dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative i e a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum unspeakable dread ensues in a double whammy for anderson shoots and mostly scores again with his eclectic riff on time travel episodes from the twilight zone appropriately titled happy accidents much like session the cards are played very close to the vest here is boyish eccentric sam deed from dubuque iowa a futuristic voyager from the year or just your run of the mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present day streets of nyc as played by wonderful character actor vincent d onofrio full metal jacket it s up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted the question proves to be moot at least for a time even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend ruby marisa tomei he s a freak but he sure tells a good story neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters the junkie the fetishist the artist the frenchman etc but isn t quite sure how to handle sam deed when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm his elaborately constructed fake identity his pathological fear of dogs his ability to speak five different languages and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time s alternate realities don t ask it s all a bit much to take in ruby s close friend gretchen cuz ya can t have a love story without the token friend though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth chalks it up as a sexy role playing game but her cautious therapist holland taylor warns her that co dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she s in over her head with yet another doomed relationship who ya gonna believe despite her winning an academy award marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear cute to her adoring fans being loud and flashing a disingenuous smile does not necessarily equal substantial and sexy it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality then there s that damned voice which strains to be oh so adorable look this stuff is purely subjective some people feel this way about richard gere others cannot bear to watch robin williams hyperactive schtick for my money it s m tomei with a bullet happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys or more appropriately chris marker s la jetee especially with those still framed memory photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan s run as the stranger in a strange land d onofrio walks slightly out of step wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion though it often falls into the sci fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition we want deeds not words at least twenty minutes too long happy accidents eventually gets around to a race against time scenario that puts sam deed to the ultimate test no movie can live in ambiguity forever but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives let s pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened shall we there are also some slow repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he s crazy the premise is strong enough to sustain interest but it s enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half hour time slots commercials included

uncompromising french director robert bresson s lancelot of the lake achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory s morte darthur instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them chivalry has no place in lancelot of the lake except as that of a dying ideal bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning decimated after failing merlin s command to retrieve the holy grail the mystical cup that was filled with christ s blood bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest bloodshed and failure the opening sequence is a series of clumsy disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights a head is hacked off a stomach is impaled a skull is split open skeletal remains hang from trees and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house since the film starts with camelot in near ruin and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion it doesn t carry the grand tragic resonance of other arthurian films we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power therefore there is no real downfall to witness but then again it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film rather it is lancelot and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart than the external downfall of a kingdom lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh the greatest of all knights he was flawed only in his love for arthur s wife queen guinevere and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere laura duke condominas he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom but he is powerless in his passion when sir mordred patrick bernhard accuses lancelot of the affair other knights including sir gawain humbert balsan spring to lancelot s defense it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table the flesh wins out over the spirit and the consequences are dire bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men s hearts and minds lancelot of the lake is filled with his particular trademarks a stripped down minimalist style flat expressionless dialogue and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music he uses background music only twice in the film during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film s thematic elements the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor the neighing of horses the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest like most of his other films bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless flat voices all the actors he used in lancelot of the lake had never acted before and with the exception of patrick bernhard they never acted again never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word instead of using vocal inflection bresson strove to create emotion through images in some ways this technique works in other ways it doesn t the final montage of arthur s men battling each other is quite marvelous and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap pile sums up the entire film in one moment however other times bresson s uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable for instance during an important jousting contest bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses legs he does this repeatedly opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag while there might be symbolic value in this the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome nevertheless lancelot of the lake is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker bresson s style may not be for everyone but one has to respect his strength as an artist by re evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own he turns lancelot of the lake into something rare in modern cinema a truly personal film 
director dominic sena who made the highly underrated kalifornia and producer jerry bruckheimer the rock armageddon bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen nicolas cage plays memphis a retired car thief who s pulled back in to the business by an evil car thief overlord christopher eccleston determined to kill memphis kid brother giovanni ribisi memphis is ordered to steal cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang memphis sets out to put his old crew back together but discovers that most of them have retired as well gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits in that sequence we get a rockin little tune from moby along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride and what follows doesn t disappoint cage turns in one of his good performances here he can easily go either way good or bad i don t know how he does that and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely of the supporting cast members angelina jolie as memphis former love is in the film just to provide eye candy she s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i ve ever seen and robert duvall as memphis former mentor is just around to lend the film some class also i m a big fan of will patton armageddon the postman and would love to see him get a huge role someday none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles delroy lindo get shorty shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis as does timothy olyphant go as lindo s partner i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll there s no doubt in anyone s mind that the cars will be successfully stolen and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the rival car thief plot line as it stands that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package but if i was making this film i d have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew thereby making memphis have to improvise thereby adding some meat to the plot the finale is essentially just a big car chase and there just aren t ways to make car chases interesting anymore it s all been done the chase is also shot and edited in that jerry bruckheimer action sequence kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene sure it s a car chase but what exactly are the particulars of it it s very hard to tell finally there s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the bus jumping the ramp sequence from speed in the oh i don t think so department despite those minor complaints gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment it s not thought provoking but it s shiny loud and fun just what a summer flick should be pg 
is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all time it s quite possible his career spanned over years and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could yet when he is talked about in the media he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role the nice guy and that s really a shame the naked spur features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him it s a western which stewart specialized in around this period and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend before he finds that man though he runs into two men who agree to help him thinking he is a sheriff when the criminal is eventually caught the two men discover stewart s secret and decide they want a piece of the action too the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal well played by janet leigh we re never too sure who s side she s really on until the end leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the shower lady from psycho and that s unfair she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men stewart gives a performance unlike anything i ve ever seen from him he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs but here he gets downright hysterical at times i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a nice guy his performance borders on psychotic at times but i loved watching every second of it it s roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do he was an actor unafraid to take chances and even ruin his public image 
one of the best things about my job is that every so often a film still catches me by surprise spy kids certainly did an adventure story aimed primarily at children the movie is smart zippy fun the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable likable kids and their parents are get ready for this intelligent capable and loving bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well staged action scenes avoid excessive violence what a relief it is to be able to review an all ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics consider the other pg rated family friendly movie in theaters now see spot run has a mother going out of town leaving her son with an idiot neighbor body function humor abounds including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process at the hospital the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn t bit off the other one because two metal replacement balls would clack together of course the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells somebody clue me in when did genital mutilation become funny spy kids is a welcome antidote to the repellent see spot run using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness carmen alexa vega and her younger brother juni daryl sabara live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents gregorio antonio banderas and ingrid cortez carla gugino mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children what the kids don t know is that they are also former spies once agents from different countries assigned to erase each other they instead fell in love married and retired to raise a family needless to say they get drawn back to the business shortly into their first joint mission they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop alan cumming a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni s favorite tv show but there is evil behind the scenes as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him back at home uncle felix cheech marin shows up to reveal mom and dad s secret to the kids after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish while a slew of wicked people including teri hatcher chase them during the course of their adventures they get to use jet packs electroshock bubblegum and super computer sunglasses they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop s tv show they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms legs and heads would normally be why are the guards so ineffective because they re all thumbs they move from one colorful locale to another including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from star trek the storyline is silly and convoluted but even at its most dense it is easier to follow than either mission impossible movie director robert rodriguez from dusk to dawn maintains a frenetic pace with the whole film clocking in at a mere minutes a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team squabbling the way kids do but coming together when it counts antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments a virtual cloud backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that i would have enjoyed the film more and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc ubiquitous company regardless spy kids is a hoot offering fun for adults and children alike and just think they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle

in may of just years after steven spielberg s success with jaws and years after francis coppolas the godfather a risky ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film in january of this year lucas re released star wars on its th anniversary in this new remastered version the added effects which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer generated jabba the hutt don t do much but call attention to themselves other than these the film is exactly the same why pay to see it in the theaters you might ask simply because when this movie was released most of us were a few years short of being born we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience especially if you haven t seen it the plot is basic but in the same way complex it has many themes but the one rotates around luke skywalker mark hamill and his quest to become a jedi knight his mission begins when a droid named r d plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia carrie fisher which tells him to contact the mysterious obi wan kanoby alec guiness he and kanoby then joined by two inter galactic renegades hans solo harrison ford and chewbacca and skywalker s two droids d and c po the voice of anthony edwards wage war upon the corrupt empire commanded by an evil general peter cushing and the traitorous darth vader the voice of james earl jones skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger the force the film is obviously quite star studded but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones voice would appear so many more times in the future it just happened to work out for him the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker s triumph is symbolized by the audience s sense of becoming something larger than life itself a universe of fans young and old recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever 
men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction action and comedy that hits the target in every possible way although another alien movie men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn t and towers above many other movies of its type the brilliant acting especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay is also as good as it gets director barry sonnenfeld who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty has crafted a masterpiece the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be the men in black or mib are a top secret governmental agency that is not known to exist the mib are responsible for saving the world from the scum of the universe a though job indeed the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens the human kind being transported across the mexico border and into the united states presumably these aliens are all migrant workers that is until the mib show up and begin interrogating them agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien but a real extra terrestrial alien when the alien makes a run for it agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib s very unique weapons and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them the device described as out of state eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on from here we are introduced to james edwards played very well by will smith edwards a police officer is chasing a fleeing criminal the criminal gives a very good chase and at one point when edwards confronts him the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go because someone is after him edwards doesn t take this seriously but when the criminal shows very non human characteristics and leaps off the building he begins to wonder back at the police station agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions he informs edwards that is was in fact a non human that he was chasing and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man made he has edwards identify the gun and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he after goofing up for half of the time edwards puts on a show at the firing range and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib he chased down the criminal on foot which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do in the meantime an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter edgar vincent d onofrio owner of the farm investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport the bug as he is called is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors and it up to the mib with newly recruited agent jay formerly james edwards to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war men in black delightfully combines fast paced action with often hilarious comedy which is usually from will smith although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot as in another big alien film from the past summer screenwriter ed solomon writer of super mario bros and the upcoming x men film has surely struck gold with this story all ages will enjoy men in black it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again although it runs a very quick and speedy minutes the entire film from beginning to end is a non stop adventure the ending of the film which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters is also very well done a sequel is already being planned so there is more to look forward to 
while watching wes anderson s rushmore it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer the film s anti hero was not written with jason schwartzman in mind the young actor making his film debut as a year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman schwartzman plays max a student who is more interested in his extra curricular activities such as writing edgy plays like serpico and being president of the rushmore beekeepers but sees his grades suffer as a result on the brink of being thrown out he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross olivia williams and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume the great bill murray to build an aquarium on rushmore s baseball field in her honour unfortunately for everyone involved blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well which gets in the way of max s plans to woo her max is one of the best written characters we ve yet seen in the s and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age as everyone else has probably already pointed out he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman although i was reminded more of paul from the wonder years from a visual standpoint at least hopefully if he avoids typecasting as weird quirky loner types he should earn himself a good career bill murray is his equal as blume displaying a depth we haven t yet seen from him while this isn t his best performance that honour goes to groundhog day he is still terrific here williams isn t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray but still does fine work rushmore seems to go just a little too long but while it isn t a perfect film it is a definate must see for anyone who wants to see that rarity an american coming of age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should with any luck rise to even greater success 
it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival s palme d or a million plus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented film maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly as a co director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn in between he has moonlighted as an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performances now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard s novel rum punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed for the most part jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie the story which starts out slowly develops into a twisty affair with double crosses and triple crosses and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire s pop tunes and close ups of womens bare feet yet for all of that the production is something of a letdown the sheer in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent the mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn t match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino s previous efforts an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives and there aren t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around there s a samuel l jackson monologue about guns a jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk and a jackson robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that s about it jackie brown s lone innovation is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives this isn t exactly an original technique it has been done numerous times before most famously in akira kurosawa s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick s courage under fire however while in those two movies and others there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points of view tarantino s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it s unconventional had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages nothing would have been lost as a result this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity for the second picture in a row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a s icon this time around instead of john travolta it s blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown has become jackie brown in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier s career tarantino uses a s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre although grier never does any butt kicking grier is jackie brown a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states she s working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel l jackson but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton a federal official no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for a bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tv s banyon to post the necessary then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal jackie passes ordell s test however and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle of ordell s money into the united states without tipping off the feds soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordell s perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert de niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l jackson but ordell isn t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction in addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get a nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guys who rarely smile roles bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons to look sexy in a bikini to provide a little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantino s foot fetish robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middle aged actor the film which clocks in at several minutes over the two and a half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout although the payoff is a letdown tarantino keeps things moving along nicely with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself when it comes to recent caper films like the grifters and bound jackie brown is a second tier effort it s an entertaining diversion but not a masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender 
of all the films i ve come to see this year i think only chasing amy had as many laugh out loud moments i m not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes and i think i m the kind of person that laughs least at movies even when i find them funny usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile so to get me laughing out loud and so frequently is a really good sign waiting for guffman is the story of blaine missouri a town celebrating it s th anniversary and the musical that is being put on for the big event the play is being directed by corky st clair christopher guest who also wrote and directed this mockumentary as well as co writing several original musical numbers the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success teaming up with st clair are a handful of blaine residents allan pearl eugene levy a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown but sitting right next to him and studying him ron and sheila albertson fred willard and catherine o hara respectively a married couple setting their sights on hollywood libby mae brown parker posey the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen and a few others everybody in this movie is brilliant absolutely so but levy particularly stands out these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can t help but love them as pathetic as they really are although levy stands out guest willard o hara and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance this is the group that should sweep it some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and even after starting very humorously they nearly lost me with the tad too long intros as delightful as it was it began to get monotonous thankfully just as your about to say ok maybe i should run to the bathroom they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes like a play this film gives a very three act feel the intros funny but almost too long the rehearsals even funnier and finally the actual performance of the play excellent like i said each character really shines even when done with a subtle approach you can t really watch these people and not think they re real people even they way they talk with awkward pauses and stumbles that don t feel staged at all you feel like you re watching a real albeit funny documentary and even with silly lyrics the original songs when the play is finally put on are absolutely wonderful as a word of note despite it s r rating waiting for guffman is really quite clean this rating came from a brief very brief use of the grand daddy of all swear words even if that really bothers you let me say that it s not presented in a vulgar cheap laugh way it s actually quite humorous and tastefully done it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman it s silly humor but it s also so dry subtle and intelligently done that you re not insulted by it it s always really nice to see a comedy that isn t all slapstick and vulgarity and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones i d recommend seeing it 
veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime his latest directorial effort when steve everett his newest character gets angry at someone he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who s just lost his cubs eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time but everett could just take the cake he gets my vote at least partly because ev is a drunken affair a week womanizer who has many relationship problems very few of which are with his wife diane venora when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies everett must take over for her at a vital interview session the interview is with frank beacham isaiah washington a death row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk eastwood furrows his brow as everett gradually finds information he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent he interviews a key witness michael jeter who claims that he burst in the door at pocum s foods because his car had overheated only to see beacham standing over the dead woman s body blood on his suspenders gun in hand but everett protests how could he have seen the gun which was lowered by his side with the potato chip rack in front of him jeter doesn t know what he s talking about eastwood furrows his brow crinkled expressions and all clint is the centre of energy of true crime the film is by no means a standard action suspense yarn but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot outs isaiah washington has a break out performance as frank beacham and scenes with him and his weary wife lisa gay hamilton are truly heartfelt moments but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him denis leary as everett s editor and boss has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger you see ev is sleeping with his wife but hands down the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera playing the big boss alan mann woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh out loud punchlines when true crime opts for a high speed chase to the governer s house at the finale the quality of film making takes an abrupt nosedive eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn t need to switch lanes true crime is a tension building intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star this is a road block he could have easily dismissed i furrow my brow 
when people are talking about good old times they actually want to make some bad times look better nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the s for new generations superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids for people who actually had to live in that period it was the gloomy decade marked by lost ideals of rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era martin scorsese s taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies is most celebrated of them all the movie s protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can t sleep at nights the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world the only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantine s presidential campaign their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre losing his only link to better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris jodie foster year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi as many great movies that got cult status through the years taxi driver became the object of many interpretations for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial cities the story could have been set in th century same as in our times for others the movie uses raskolnikov like figure in order to portray burning problems of s america its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today many of us share his feelings of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drugs prostitution and senseless street violence his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstances like with secret service agents pimps or job interviewers make him a person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain however most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person wants but doesn t have a stomach lack of brains to do it while de niro s travis might come in and out of particular times and places other persons that appear in the film mostly played by the character actors give it distinctively s feel wizzard played by peter boyle presents the only link with america s better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he knows stuff his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade other characters on the other hand show the bad side of new age matthew sport keitel who befriended real life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime is dressed like a hippie iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture porno movies that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy even the politicians like senator palantine are lost in post vietnam and post watergate mess his broad and senseless messages that cover the lack of any serious program can t fool even such idiots like travis the past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism can t be washed away even by ironic happy end travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader s screenplay into the silver screen new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was same as his protagonist famous for the wrong reason instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits for many years it was tabloid fodder because of hinckley and his real life re enactment of events in the movie now more than two decades later when some other life imitating art incidents get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory 
there s a thin line between satire and controversy and mike nichols the birdcage wolf has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election based on the book written by anonymous actually former newsweek writer joe klein john travolta plays governor jack stanton but he doesn t actually play stanton he plays bill clinton just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville although the credits will of course say otherwise the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton adrian lester a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations and whether it be keeping the history of his boss pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers richard jemmons billy bob thorton and daisy green maura tierney team up with henry as the would be president s advisors and hire lesbian veteran libby holden kathy bates as the campaign s eccentric tougher than dirt incriminator together they face all sorts of sexual allegations the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race in its satire and controversy primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it s characters letting us understand what they want and why and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look and the rest of the cast also make superb performances adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden at occasions you can t help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste there are long slabs of time where john travolta unquestionably the most interesting to watch is missed from the screen and since it is awkwardly structured as henry s story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot or even the point of the film having said that make no mistake primary colors is always enjoyable to watch but frequently we have to ask ourselves exactly what are we watching most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary and almost unsuitable to the rest of the film but as i mentioned before there is a thin line between satire and controversy and for the most part primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far from overpowering look at winning the public s opinion although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is thankfully it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it s scary 
until i saw the night of the hunter it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie forget the others and the deep end which veered toward strained dramatics the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i ve seen so far this year even though the movie is nearly years old and there s a not drop of blood to be seen luckily the night of the hunter charles laughton s first and final directing gig has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re released in october so there s still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place robert mitchum stars as harry powell a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash his newest target is young mother willa harper shelley winters whose murderer husband ben peter graves has hidden somewhere powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs harper after he s released and ben is hanged but finding the money isn t easy for powell who must contend with his stepchildren billy chapin and sally jane bruce who know where the money is but aren t telling the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin no i m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem yes there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter powell s love and hate knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing remember radio raheem and powell s black suit with black tie and white shirt could have shaped quentin tarantino s early visual style seeing the night of the hunter for the first time i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears he s like the senior class president with an evil streak if i ever need to stay awake i ll just picture him crooning leaning leaning any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez who create a series of haunting surreal shadowy images over the rural depression era backdrop it s a testament to both men that they re able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline kids harassed by evil guardians by sticking to the old maxim that we re more scared by what we don t see screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters the drunk birdie james gleason who s haunted by his wife and the spoons evelyn varden and walt spoon whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act the only lapse is the movie s third act when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly bible reading mrs cooper lillian gish her showdown with powell is memorable a battle done with dueling hymns however the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone but it s still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun do yourself favor and don t miss this if it comes to a nearby theater note a series of revealing but overlong outtakes preceded the movie the highlights included the legendary laughton who sounds eerily like mr pitt from seinfeld running winters lines with mitchum and the adorable tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile hours more of such footage exists as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling screened as part of the new york film festival retrospectives feature story coming soon 
i like movies with albert brooks and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films which are finding their way into theaters the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with but even if we can t brooks has the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won t find an albert brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will put simply brooks comedy is intelligent mother is albert brooks latest film and it does not disappoint brooks plays john henderson a middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce he makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably he then has dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life jeff has a good job a loving family and most of all a warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds after dinner john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is in comparison beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him and john gives it right back to her at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john s life she says i love you and john replies with i know you think you do the thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading it s the kind that goes something like yes dear i think you do that wonderfully but it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy there s always the big but john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is a great experiment he calls it brooks own brand of humor really shines in this film especially in the interaction john has with his mother there s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother s house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you don t want to stay at a hotel she still doesn t get it and it is absolutely hilarious in the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over when john points out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice asks john he s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as a twenty pound block of cheese the freezer was a good invention says john but it s not supposed to be used for everything that s why it s smaller than the refrigerator it s something most of us find strangely familiar brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur for example in defending your life his and meryl streep s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion when they re finished and walk out brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside you don t know what the joke was because you couldn t hear him during the entire scene but i must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context in this film brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene i don t want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past john s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we as the audience learn right along with him his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but as john spends more time with her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way on screen brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world in a way he s very much like yosarian of catch expect with something of an attitude casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect she assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking a little slowly and is just so adorable it s hard to get mad at her character this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her as his first choice brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer s disease that may be just as well since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother s favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as a mama s boy the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes a solid connection is not really made between john s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother additionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this beatrice you must think i m some kind of moron john no i think your someone who thinks i m a moron beatrice well it takes one to

damn those trailers had it not been for the advertising of this film which reveals far too much about its contents i would have been glued to under the sand as it is the film retains some value thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling and a more mature francois ozon in the director s chair marie charlotte rampling and her husband jean bruno cremer lounge on the beach she takes a nap while he goes for a swim when marie wakes up jean is nowhere to be found she contacts authorities but they can t find him either did he disappear to start a new life was he killed by accident did he commit suicide marie still asks herself these questions a year later and in order to move on with her life she must find some answers it s a fine premise and this little movie uses it to the limit the film moves at a leisurely pace a bit slow but relaxing it s a very visual story and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie who shot the film in a dreamy haze and the lead performance by rampling rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie you connect with her character instantly despite that she s delusional the scenes where she interacts with her husband who she still believes is alive are heartbreaking she can t quite get over him they ve been married for twenty five years the other actors particularly jacques nolot are excellent too the sex in the film is rather unneeded but compared to ozon s criminal lovers it s the disney channel likely to cause some discussion afterwards under the sand is a fine movie going experience while it s hard to recommend as entertainment it s a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss ozon seems to ask what you would do and that s certainly a hard question to answer 
denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances this perhaps may be washington s very best to date he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent this season to become his character copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting the hurricane a much better film than it actually is when his rubin hurricane carter feels pain and is tormented by racism he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy disgust and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone as his tortured carter sum up the troubles of racism in america s history he is that amazing the problem with the hurricane is that when compared to washington all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles mainly because the script focuses so much on carter that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors this is without a doubt washington s movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance as rubin carter we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit then after a successful marriage and boxing career he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder carter s second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous powerful white men who refused to let him succeed from these past experiences in jail carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america after several court appeals an autobiography and many public marches for his freedom carter remained locked in prison it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter s book in the s that a serious battle for freedom took place the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career the devastation in washington s eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it in the hole carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot his anger is heightened to a point of no control we see multiple carters a violent angry one a silent passive one and a mediator we see an emotional boxing match inside carter s head from this point in the hole to the end of the film this fight continues it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison the angry carter at first erupts white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life this reminder leads to anger in his head however as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him he realizes that society is changing that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here if only the other actors had this same determination dan hedaya ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around it felt like his character was taken straight out of a scooby doo episode he would have gotten away with it if it wasn t for those annoying little kids the kids in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable the lawyers who help release carter also are underused as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard the complete opposite of his character in shawshank redemption there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears hedaya was superb in clueless same for david paymer in get shorty harris yulin in ghostbusters and liev schreiber in the daytrippers it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles on the other hand it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin hurricane carter this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get 
finding the courage to face life full on is a difficult task summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job if you re a total jerk like melvin udall is the odds are even more against you melvin jack nicholson is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship he avoids the outside world as much as possible his obsessive compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk there s a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles very small mosaic tiles melvin has some great lines when his publisher s receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books he responds i think of men and i take away reason and accountability don t get him wrong he s not merely a misogynist setting his sights higher than that he s also a homophobe racist anti semite xenophobe animal hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors when we first meet him he s busy dumping a neighbor s dog down the garbage chute he s an equal opportunity bigot he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly helen hunt is the only one willing to wait on him and she s none too happy about it when carol doesn t show up for work melvin s routine is shot and he s determined to do something about it tracking down her address he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast the fact that she s a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn t appear to phase him he wants his food much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop greg kinnear is brutally attacked during a robbery this doesn t upset melvin much don t worry you ll be back on your knees in no time but when he is bullied into taking care of simon s dog his life is turned topsy turvey melvin is sequestered because he s afraid of what s out there on the other side of his apartment door he has to make sure it s ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him he pays for a specialist to treat her son he even develops a friendship with simon all three people are heavily damaged melvin has retreated from life in his apartment carol has devoted herself to her son convinced that she has to give up her life for him simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out a more unlikely trio to form relationships you d rarely see and in the midst of it all there are some wonderful moments melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice you make me want to be a better man he tells her one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up he is still a curmudgeon carol afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t shirt contest there s hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson i don t remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over the edge melvin is no disappointment nicholson may be the best actor working today hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson s energy she isn t afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top notch their on screen chemistry is a bit odd each does a wonderful job with the character but together there s something a little off it s a minor problem they do work well together but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four star film director james l brooks terms of endearment broadcast news has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful nominees for all the top golden globes winners from the national board of review inevitable oscars and has a winner on his hands as good as it gets isn t exactly the quality that the title says but it s pretty darn close michael redman has written this column for over years and as soon as he finishes this one he s off to an annual night celebration typically held in freezing weather during a snowstorm this year it s in the sixties and raining that wacky el nino 
let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film i really wasn t looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films i m not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years i m happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first minutes of the film by that point it was evident that mr bond was back with a vengeance all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren t exactly a pleasant experience it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in i guess they can be excused though taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain anyway after somebody remembered what the light switch was for i settled in for bond i think the most noticeable aspect of this the th film in the series is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films there were probably more one liners in this movie than in the last several combined and bond s last one liner in the film is about the best of the series the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for for the most part the action sequences worked very well although there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top even for a bond film i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted while he did a good job for the most part there were points in the movie specifically during action sequences that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie he almost seemed like he didn t know what he was doing but they were brief scenes and really shouldn t take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing if you have ever seen a bond film you won t be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit the world is not enough is no exception this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world matches wits with the terrorist renard robert carlyle a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain why this point is included is beyond me they took great pains to explain his condition but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought anyway renard like the typical terrorist that he is is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid east oil pipeline i guess world domination just isn t as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore bond is brought in to protect the pipeline s owner elektra king sophie marceau who is the daughter of one of renard s recent victims along the way bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist dr christmas jones denise richards and his old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle like all bond films you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot since it is ridiculous beyond words my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau s character it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly although not included in the film later it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something but because it is a bond film the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly after all it isn t shakespeare how about the cast brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as i grew up with the roger moore version of bond so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character judi dench as m had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie coltrane gets more screen time which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes then there are the bond girls sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest then we have denise richards there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks and after you see the outfits she wears you won t have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer s eyes i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist admittedly there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue but other than that she stacks up no pun intended to her bond girl predecessors nicely i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle s character while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had his character just never worked for me the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character but it just never quite got off the ground i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character this might have worked well in another movie but i don t go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations last but not least we have desmond llewelyn as q this is the th appearance for llewelyn as bond s gadget guy and he is as good as ever although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films he is still a treat to watch rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role he says future appearances are up to a higher power the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese while we don t see much of him in this film i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn s legacy whenever it is passed on will be in very capable hands so how does it stack up despite some problems the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie and all things considered what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies this is easily the best of the brosnan films it may even be the best of the entire series certainly in the top one thing is for sure even after movies there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series here s looking forward to bond number 
with stars like sigourney weaver alien trilogy and academy award winner holly hunter the piano raising arizona etc together in a single hollywood production one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot sadly for copycat though tightly scripted and nicely plot is still at heart a typical hollywood thriller helen weaver after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer darryl harry connick jr has developed a phobia for being outdoors so to speak incidentally helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco detective monahan hunter and getz mulroney baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer seeks the professional help of helen who as expected was reluctant at first copycat borrows a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases it did work but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also much of the time wasted could ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama even so weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments weaver being the vulnerable yet strong within character as in aliens and hunter being the short tough texan speaking cop as in raising arizona harry connick jr a very good jazz singer shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter which comes to the moment of judgement drum roll please copycat is a good thriller although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about minutes into the show copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats in anticipation of the killers next immediate move this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts nice movie to bring your girlfriend to 
in enemy at the gates jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov joseph fiennes who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad it s world war ii and the russian german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland law s vassili is the russian s top pawn to victory lots of war stuff happens an older german version of jude s character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings he s equally talented and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other they constantly switch roles as the war fades far into the background the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov the set up is decent and so are the production values boasting a wide range of grimy locales greasy hair and tattered costumes the art direction prospers the actors however suffer the problem matt damon had in saving private ryan either their eyes teeth skin or a combination of other features looked too white and clean with dirt and blood all around the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action that said the players are mostly good in their roles although i don t think ed harris was really trying maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one notedom while the film is technically about snipers there are far too many predictable sniping scenes director jean jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting but after about the sixth time in which we realize that jude is not going to die it s relatively pointless we get that he s talented okay let s move on that s the problem with enemy at the gates it just doesn t know when to stop witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere reestablishing his title as the most beautiful and often talented man on film jude law carries the movie without him this costly production would have gone into the ground the story and acting are of good quality but there s never a sense of authenticity or reality something about this war movie is undeniably modern and it loses its feeling strange enough the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper 
driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small intimate story it s a quiet film a slow film a deliberate film but if you re patient with it the movie offers innumerable rewards such as a pair of self assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry s pulitzer prize winning play of the same name which first opened in new york four years ago the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago los angeles london vienna norway and the soviet union uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy he also penned the wonderful sleeper mystic pizza the film like the play is set in atlanta georgia and it revolves around two people in their twilight years a cranky something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a something black man who becomes her chauffeur the movie relies on character rather than plot to propel the action in fact the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense it doesn t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together rather driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life shopping listening to the radio visiting the cemetery eating fried chicken and so on the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta s history including the bombing of the temple the city s oldest jewish congregation and a ceremony honoring the reverend dr martin luther king jr the story begins in with daisy tandy crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway the insurance company cancels her insurance and her son boolie decides to hire her a chauffeur freeman reprising his role from the play plays the chauffeur hoke the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature aging prejudice and a great many other things but more than anything it s about a relationship one that spans years cars the advent of civil rights and one gravely important cent can of salmon daisy is strong willed and set in her ways and from the outset she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur initially she treats hoke with contempt refusing to let him drive her anywhere once she does get in the car daisy is the ultimate back seat driver to make matters worse she is extremely self conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand eventually however daisy is worn down by hoke s good natured charm and infectious cheer she softens and opens up to him tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well but unfortunately this feisty cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace we ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations from on golden pond to cocoon nevertheless tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own freeman as hoke on the other hand gives the more distinctive of the two performances there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color hoke is uneducated and illiterate but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element in full command of their natural charisma they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie s gentle humor at the same time tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama in his first dramatic role dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie tandy s loving and patient son drama seems to agree with aykroyd taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ghostbusters ii the great outdoors my stepmother is an alien the only other significant characters in the film are daisy s housekeeper idella marvelously played by esther rolle good times and boolie s pretentious wife played by patti lupone under the direction of bruce beresford crimes of the heart tender mercies driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again but fortunately beresford never forgets he s shooting a movie and accordingly he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches such as gorgeous shots of flowers trees and tomatoes in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film s dramatic moments the movie tugs at your heart but it never goes for the jugular the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees 
of circumcision psychic wounds and the family sitcom the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film there s a guy s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women as his imagination plays o n he and we picture these motley characters in a mix and match shuffle of unlikely marriages businesswomen with bums matrons with paint salesmen the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy it s not just a witty funny summing up of the film s themes you might not guess it yet but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction gets taken on a road trip put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom and the general idea of the film doesn t at first seem so wildly distant from standard issue hollywood comedy man who was adopted as a child ben still er sets out on a journey to meet his real parents along with his wife patricia arquette his baby and a pretty psychology researcher tea leoni in tow various mix ups shenanigans oddball characters and yup disasters follow but if you think you ve been here before the dialogue and the direction by david o russell who made spanking the monkey take it into another dimension the dreaded t name seems an inevitable reference point what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance but really the point is that the foot massage master hasn t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast funny irreverent lines or on the absurdities of ordinary speech whether it s about circumcision psychic wounds oral sex carjacking the beauties of the armpit area or ronald reagan the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention the best thing is how these words aren t just there for the punchlines but are great precisely because they re said in character like tea leoni s neurotically charged psychobabbler who s able to say under assault it s understandable if you find this threatening the cast is excellent throughout and rather than singling out anybody kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission there are some elements of a woody allen film in this not to mention the hand held camera and loose improvisational feel of some scenes like allen russell s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children and everybody really still if you re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la murphy brown frasier fill in the blank american comedy well it won t happen the film sets up expectations like these with the lead character s search f or his origins and his hopes of self healing only to knock them down if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one ness flirting with disaster s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go and that the film suggests is the essential family state and you better learn to love it somehow this is perversely feelgood cinema right up to its manic end 
tone alone cannot sustain a film but it can go a long way if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story it scores immediate style points when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly literary what s eating gilbert grape is such a film it s a rich memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence gilbert grape johnny depp is a young man living in rural endora iowa facing incredible responsibilities as the man of the house since his father s suicide gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie leonardo dicaprio and help care for his extremely overweight mother darlene cates gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky juliette lewis a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down as he spends time with becky gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing slowly his resentment builds until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people director lasse hallstrom my life as a dog and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges screenplay based on his own novel endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real minor characters like crispin glover as the town s mortician are vividly realized and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen s desperately unhappy housewife one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off key high school band not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false the same can be said of the character of gilbert it s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line when becky responds to gilbert s description of his father with i knew someone like that once gilbert is a man harboring an ever growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty in one scene he allows local children to look at his mother through their window displaying her like a side show attraction his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie s repeated chants of we re not going anywhere but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer and it becomes clear that he is following in his father s footsteps in this regard johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface but he never gives in to one dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny joon and edward scissorhands depp s performance is overshadowed however by leonardo dicaprio s astonishing oscar nominated supporting work as arnie he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard pressed to spot a flaw darlene cates a first time actor brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert s tortured mother and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert s sisters only juliette lewis doesn t quite click playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion but it never lost me thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast this release proves well worth the wait 
meteor threat set to blow away all volcanoes twisters summer is here again this season could probably be the most ambitious season this decade with hollywood churning out films like deep impact godzilla the x files armageddon the truman show all of which has but one main aim to rock the box office leading the pack this summer is deep impact one of the first few film releases from the spielberg katzenberg geffen s dreamworks production company following the rather dismal showing of their previous two releases mousehunt and amistad deep impact shines with elements which could just make it one of the biggest movies of the year deep impact begins with the discovery of an earth bound comet during a school astronomy outing by leo beiderman elijah wood which subsequently stirred up the political community of the world keeping the information under wraps to prevent widespread panic president beck morgan freeman took it upon himself and his subordinates to execute a highly secretive space project to destroy the comet before it hits earth while pursuing a sex scandal story amongst the presidential ranks ambitious up and coming reporter jenny lerner tea leoni unfolds the wool that president beck has pulled over the citizens of the world as if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of mankind is not enough jenny has to come to terms with her father maximillian schell leaving the mother for a younger woman president beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the comet exactly one year later with so much confidence that it left no trace of panic within the american community achieving fame from announcement of the comet wolf beiderman en route to earth the name of its discoverers leo beiderman continues life in his small town as a young celebrity a team of astronauts led by the ageing veteran astronaut spurgeon tanner robert duvall was secretly trained to carry out the mission to land on the comet and create and explosion with a nuclear device with the hope of blowing it out of its current path towards earth despite him being the most experienced in the team the younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts tanner s ability due to his age but these are just problems of individuals life on earth goes on as any other day confident that the comet will be destroyed when the attempt to avert wolf beiderman s path failed and caused the comet to split into two comet wolf and comet beiderman the president unfolds his contingency plan to evacuate part of the population leaving the rest to die citizens are randomly chosen to live underground for years prior to impact when the dust due to the impact around earth have settled by then all life on the surface would have died jenny and leo were picked but many of their loved ones were not only a handful of earth s population will be saved from destruction deep impact s moving moments occur in the least special effect laced scenes while the effects are fantastic they only form a small part of the film which indulges itself in the development of its main characters leo lerner and tanner leo s struggle when he learns that his girlfriend is not part of the population to be saved lerner s dwindling relationship with her father and her pain for the mother s loneliness tanner s strive to gain the respect he deserves from his crew and his ultimate sacrifice all form the backbone of deep impact s moving moments deep impact smells suspiciously like the previous year release contact despite vivid differences i think its probably because they both delve in a story of global proportions and indulges in the premise of hope faith and life itself both do not depend heavily on eye candy in the form of cgi effects director mimi leder who won numerous awards directing television series and made her debut with peacekeeper last year is definitely a director to watch despite this being the first of the two meteor movies this summer the other being armageddon i think there will be stark differences in the approach to the subject matter while the premise of both may be the same execution and focus of the films will in fact show that deep impact has more focus on human elements than armageddon which is done by the team which brought us bad boys crimson tide and the rock deep impact should be able to satisfy a variety of audiences from the most action craving to those who just want to immerse into its manipulative but nonetheless dramatic premise 
whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films the end result is always a mess of a script acting directing and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above the latest movie morass from hollywood the crew appeared equally destined to fail a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship the scary thing is that it s actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month the crew works for several reasons the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie following four past their prime wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their golden paradise by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property the four mobsters bobby bartellemeo richard dreyfuss joey bats pistella burt reynolds mike the brick donatelli dan hedaya and tony mouth donato seymour cassel decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home this simple plan suddenly goes screwy of course and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris jennifer tilly who wants her stepmother killed a paranoid latin drug lord who s convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him and a rat with its tail on fire the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men instead of concentrating on bobby s search for his daughter the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys balancing the production the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya seymour cassel and the great great burt reynolds are brought out by each character s uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend cop partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner emmy award winning director of the wonder years the quick script written by barry fanaro screenwriter of kingpin is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit the crew is a prime example of how simple and dry witted a comedy can get these days the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids phallus symbols in the head or grandmothers giving head in a spa in the steady flow of extreme comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main it s the elder statesmen like dreyfuss reynolds and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice a decent script and good acting 
when bulworth ended i allowed myself a sigh of relief it is possible for me to enjoy political satire there have been several recent political films that didn t do a whole lot for me wag the dog for instance i found to be an intelligent but heartless film while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness bulworth is a far better film than these both in its execution and lasting impression it s a tremendously funny and intelligent picture but it also has an emotional center writer director star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character and in turn we like him and actually care about the story beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again he hasn t slept in days nor has he eaten and almost instantaneously he goes insane he s not stark raving mad not outright anyway but he s definitely bonkers it s the final weekend of his campaign and his assistant murphy oliver platt has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto bulworth begins the speech but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest you mean one lady asks the democratic party doesn t care about the african american community well he shouts laughing isn t that obvious the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life he muses later that it s a bad thing to make decisions when you re suicidal he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses graham beckel whom he believes to be the hitman bulworth also meets nina halle berry with whom he becomes infatuated suddenly in the short span of this weekend bulworth s no nonsense truth in politics methods become a national sensation and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences beatty s work on both sides of the camera is excellent his script and direction are both extremely sharp as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself here is a man who s reached his limit and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure i like that the film doesn t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich although the anti rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film some of the segments are simply hilarious such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him much of the film is completely absurd but that s the fun part about it it s an angry serious film at the core but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre what adds to this feeling is beatty s portrayal of bulworth this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale beatty is so much fun to watch here he s always funny but he s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions beatty is so good that bulworth despite his shortcomings as a human being is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning the supporting cast is vast and colorful berry is luminous as always and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun toting toddlers to do his dirty work oliver platt is an actor who should be careful for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting though he s very funny to watch paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections is bulworth offensive i suppose some may see it that way i wasn t offended by the film but then again i hardly care about politics i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story the film isn t perfect of course the ending didn t quite work for me and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film bulworth is a smart uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface 
susan granger s review of hearts in atlantis castle rock warner bros timing is everything and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming of age nostalgia of stand by me with the mystical power of the green mile based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks it s set in in harwich connecticut where fatherless year old bobby garfield anton yelchin lives in a boarding house with his resentful self centered mother hope davis he s devoted to his neighborhood friends mika boorem will rothhaar but his pivotal relationship is with a strange new tenant ted brautigan anthony hopkins who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him instead a library card knowing he s longing for a schwinn bike ted offers to pay him a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers the story structure consists of one long flashback framed by the present featuring the adult bobby david morse minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins mysterious character is genteel sensitive and benignly seductive the only explanation is that he s a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate given the inexplicable state of the world right now the production values and performances are solid particularly hopkins arguably the finest most versatile actor of our era and the children with whom he forges a firm bond on the granger movie gauge of to hearts in atlantis is a wistful enigmatic evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis 
after having heard so many critics describe return to me as an old fashioned hollywood romance i kept asking myself going into this movie what exactly is an old fashioned hollywood romance what made return to me old fashioned and old hollywood was it the tunes from sinatra etc legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on was it the glamorous sophisticated feel the charisma of the two leads even now i can t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer because i haven t see that many old fashioned hollywood romances i don t think any of the romances i ve seen have been classified as such which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics return to me was old fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider it was traditional magical we knew it couldn t be too daring or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity tenderness and love from director bonnie hunt that it couldn t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt s direction from the very first bird s eye view of chicago zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland david duchovny accompanied by the return to me ballad by whom we can tell we re in for something sweet the scenes between the characters are endearing truthful with just a hint of fantasy real people don t act that way real people aren t that nice we know all this and yet we want to believe in these folks existence the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale but hunt s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal everything is ordinary yet beautiful in this film from the festive little family restaurant to grace minnie driver and bob s wardrobes from the eloquent not in a hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen the most beautiful part return to me has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist we care for them laugh with them cry with them we re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father whatever hunt did she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors disappointingly david alan grier s charlie however much i like him was the most flatly written duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona with the help of his fellow co stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of the x files duchovny who is excellent at understatement and self deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer though an unlikely pair duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses while return to me functions remarkably as a laugh out loud comedy a romantic scenic tour through chicago and a tearjerker the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife s heart we already know that there s going to be a happy ending we feel like we spend the entire film however enjoyably in a straight line going towards that point as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly yes i know she s supposed to have his ex wife s heart and everything it seems too effortless the main subject is a love story and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters whose story might not have that much meat after all however in the spirit of return to me it won t do to be too picky about how old hollywood tells its stories i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt it shows the bottom line return to me is nothing remarkable and yet its sweetness sincerity and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn t imagined 
 rebel without a cause is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to everyone feels that they are different in some way that they don t belong in some places and rebel without a cause successfully shows on screen these universal emotions no matter what generation you belong to these feelings are present this is why james dean is admired by america because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute in our minds we just try to do the right thing just like dean s jim stark does not only does rebel without a cause display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection this is because times change and in response people change no matter how popular you were once as your generation grows older newer breeds look at you in a different light this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past the teens could not believe this in one humorous scene stark his girlfriend judy natalie wood and his pal plato sal mineo pretend they are adults they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another speaking on behalf of my generation i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation same goes for brando redford even deniro i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon ben affleck and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film even if rebel without a cause has some ridiculous scenes the game of chicken did people really act this way an unbelievable conclusion how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end and a silly romance wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours it still is a fabulous film the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool now however the coolness is fading 
there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure the culture and the brotherhood of white supremacy nice guy ed norton jr who sang in everyone says i love you plays derek a twenty year old skinhead dad s subtle racism grew large in derek after gang members killed his father dad was fighting a fire when they shot him now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence at a basketball court black and white tempers flare derek channels the aggression into a game black versus white for ownership of the courts when the choice presents itself derek goes for game point instead of the sucker punch cameron stacy keach steps in to derek s life as a surrogate father he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings keeping his own criminal record spotless he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high visibility racial intimidation derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race motivated mob crimes at the bottom of the chain derek s younger brother danny edward furlong made famous in terminator joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong one night three black youths break into derek s truck which is exactly what derek has been waiting for outside in his shorts and his tattoo he shoots them all the third would be thief unarmed is only wounded in the key scene of the film derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious enraptured awful stomp the fun spoiling nc of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate considering american history x was rated r what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal ecstatic violence the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief derek does not resist the cops and as they spin him around to cuff him the film slows down derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling sadistic satisfied grin now in prison derek faces new challenges as the black man in the laundry tells him in the joint you the nigra not me there is a clique of swastika wearing skinheads but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation derek finds himself truly alone truly in danger and truly afraid when derek finally gets out of prison he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed without derek s leadership they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he s screwed up in the end he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny the film ends a little too deliberately too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film but it barely detracts from the overall experience edward norton gives an oscar worthy performance although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction norton s performance compensated an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store he also captured the essence of an older brother he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously very lovingly both before and after his change of heart though clearly not for all tastes this film is bold and daring the subject matter is ugly cruel and at times hard to look at nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity s great face kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating if distasteful american subculture 
usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock others will mention meg ryan but for me it s not even close janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now and it s a good thing she s starring in the matchmaker because without her presence the movie would be bland unfunny and dull garofalo stars as marcy tizard a top aide to boston senator john mcglory who is suffering in the polls in an attempt to capture the irish vote he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory s that never moved to america unfortunately for marcy her visit coincides with the town s annual matchmaking festival things get off to a rocky start for marcy though she has no hotel reservations for no rational reason and the tiny confined room tired old cliche she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub his name is sean and marcy finds him repugnant at first so you can obviously tell where this is headed the movie runs into a few roadblocks for instance the story is very thin none of the characters except the old local matchmaker are nearly as interesting as garofalo some of the characters like the political aide played by denis leary have wandered in from a completely different movie i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery and several close ups of garofalo s winning smile the strange thing is that it works garofalo s charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories and it carries this one 
when i first heard that disney s next animated feature was going to be tarzan i was almost horrified i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules sorry jerk ules that effort was too overloaded with comedy and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero and after viewing it to this day i find it a disgrace for disney animation when i saw the trailers i was thinking hmm this isn t bad at all this just might have potential when i bought the soundtrack i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features i have never really heard of phil collins nor have i heard of mark mancina so i was wondering how would these two make this disney flick spin i was pleasantly surprised the music is top notch phil collins songs are terrific percussion heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs the score from mark mancina was also neat it reminded me a bit of the lion king but it was more original so the soundtrack wasn t bad at all considering it was by two people i am not familiar with this film could be good but will it be when i finally went to see it on opening day as i tend to do with most disney animated features my question was answered in a complete turnabout of expectations for me disney s tarzan is surprisingly decent the story starts out with tarzan s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace however one day a vicious leopard sabor attacks and kills tarzan s parents leaving him at this time a baby alone until kala of the apes rescues him kala wants to raise the child as her own she lost hers previously to sabor but her mate kerchak is not too sure it s not our kind he says he agrees though to let her take care of little tarzan but that doesn t make him my son tarzan grows up vowing to be the best ape ever but no matter how hard he tries or what he does at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend terk he just can t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes even when he defeats sabor in a battle one day a new animal shows up humans this is where jane comes into the picture she is on an expedition with her father professor porter and a despicable hunter clayton searching for gorillas tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons and soon they get to know each other even though tarzan falls in love with jane this causes things to go wrong clayton tricks tarzan into taking him jane and porter to see the apes who are convinced that he has betrayed them worse clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes i m not gonna tell you sorry you re gonna have to see for yourself and see it you should the animation is as always top notch particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees read that skateboarding the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in in fact it seems similar to the computer imagery cel animation combination in rival disney animted films such as fox s anastasia and dreamworks prince of egypt could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals the casting is fairly good tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan and to my relief the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules nicely done and glenn close is wonderful as kala she has a beautiful singing voice too by the way lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson s beast voice which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film when i first saw the trailers but when i saw the film i didn t have a problem with her i take back my insult on driver it s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature he was fflewdurr flamm in disney s most underrated classic the black cauldron he is funny and delightful as professor porter on the villiany side of the voices brian blessed the guy who did boss nass in star wars episode i the phantom menace brings a pompous and later on vicious voice to the sinister clayton he might not be the strongest character in the film he s just a plain bad guy nothing else but blessed s vocal work contributes greatly but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show it should be rosie o donnell who is hilariously funny as terk she also has a fiesty attitude i m gonna kill ya she says more than once i almost sung along with her during one of the film s best moments where the apes make a mess of the human s camp via song er scatting shoo be doo da be dah i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film she s a good singer not that she was the only funny character in the film though wayne knight who played stan in space jam gives a whimsically funny style to tantor an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into un sanitary water thankfully there is no real sound of flatuence that would have killed the picture the songs as i said before are decent mostly sung by collins this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time the characters do not sing i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would but i found this to be a nice change of pace the story does have elements of comedy in it but they also load it with strong dramatic touches which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules if there is anything disappointing about tarzan it might be the omission of the n sync version of trashing the camp from the film i heard it on the soundtrack and wondered where it was going to be i was upset that it wasn t because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like n sync to see tarzan oh well overall i was enthralled with tarzan i wouldn t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame my all time favorite disney classics but this film deserves a high place among disney s greatest achievements i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular masterpiece mulan with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough s tarzan 
i feel no hesitation in saying that there s something about mary is the best film that i will see all year from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of it is that good of a film when gene siskel said this about fargo only a few months into i dismissed the notion as ridiculous how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it but after seeing the farrelly s hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork i now know what siskel was talking about once in a very great while a film comes along that is so daring so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end you just want to stand up and cheer and you know at that instant that you have just experienced something very special now for the shocker mary is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed pink flamingos obviously notwithstanding the movie is so rude and i guess inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents luckily i had seen it before them so i could warn the about what they were in for forget blazing saddles animal house and even the former king of gross out comedy monty python s meaning of life they were all only preludes to the farrelly s assault on the senses in fact this may even be the funniest film i ve ever had the pleasure of seeing the only real contender is monty python and the holy grail and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade but as funny as it is something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of mary it has a huge heart you see the farrelly s are truly gifted filmmakers they don t just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes although there are plenty to go around they also very wisely add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses it s funny though if you just look at an outline of the story it seems kind of contrived and predictable but believe me it is anything but ben stiller plays ted a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe mary cameron diaz after he sticks up for her retarded brother warren w early brown the cameraman believe it or not from scream his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom in one of the film s funniest scenes something goes wrong i won t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film and ted is unable to face mary ever again jump to the present after years of self loathing ted finally hires private detective pat healy a suitably slimy matt dillon to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school healy finds that mary is still a full blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself admittingly the basic story line leaves a little to be desired after all with a not really all that funny premise how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours somehow the farrelly s pull it off the performances here are also right on target as ted stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating as he would normally be but very lovable and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons but the actor who really grabs your attention is w earl brown as mary s brother no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here i know he won t be nominated but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february as good as the actors are though it s the directors movie all the way i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg s wwii epic saving private ryan and yes that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting but which is harder making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can t breath for minutes at a time i ll let you decide that one for yourself but this critic is sticking to his guns there is just something about mary 
based on the boris karloff s classic by the same name the mummy starts off with the high priest of osiris imhotep who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible bandaged up having his tongue removed and being covered in flesh eating scarab beetles then entombed all while still alive recap a few thousand years later where a soldier named rick played by brandan fraser aids a young historian named evelyn played by rachel wiesz and her brother jonathan played by john hannah in finding the book of amon ra in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress using evelyn as a sacrifice walking in with relatively low expectations i thought this movie was actually pretty good the visuals and cgi are astounding and obviously not cheaply done at all they pack a ton of detail into the images especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes such as unnerving moments involving flesh eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him after all those who took his artifacts are cursed unfortunately the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time becoming a tug of war for control between genres on one hand it is a fast paced action film on the other it s a frightening horror film and on the side it s a hilarious comedy ideally for it to be successful the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect with one character serving as the comic relief that would be johnson the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief with rick occasionally delivering his witty one liner if they were trying to make a horror action comedy it would have helped if it were established early on in the film but unfortunately with the backstory of imhotep s entombment that would be impossible and then there s the slapstick fight scene between a sword wielding rick and an army of mummies while really well done it had the feel of slapstick comedy replace the sword with a chainsaw and you d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness while entertaining and funny it feels really out of place but at least it s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of on the whole the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end entertaining the audience but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners turn the sound down while a lot of theatres have good sound systems my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you re not careful when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film end of days it was so loud i couldn t make anything out 
in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library casablanca was my third classic in some weeks the others being citizen kane and vertigo yes i am trying to see as many of afi s greatest movies ever made as i can but casablanca stood out from the rest for me it was actually watchable what most hail as the greatest american film ever casablanca isn t so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in it seems that star humphry bogart spend about percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman that annoyed me as did the ending why didn t the plan turn around surprisingly i enjoyed the film i liked bogart s character and his acting not over the top as most actors in his era i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie which one would it be and a women said casablanca at first i was thinking to myself why then as i watched the film again i understood why the movie is very well done and the script top notch although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo casablanca is in my mind no classic like solaris but it is a good film and stylishly shot hey hollywood how about this a remake with harrison ford and anne heche now that would be a classic 
available for rental october things i hate about you is an update of the classic play the taming of the shrew that said drop any pre conceived notions of what shakespeare s work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school home of a student counselor allison janney who obsesses over the male penis a slightly too hip and racist african american english teacher daryl mitchell a new kid named cameron joseph gordon levitt a model named joey andrew keegan the subject of cameron and joey s crushes bianca larisa oleynik and bianca s sister the shrew julia stiles in a marvelous performance whose name is katarina kat for short with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile it would be quite easy to write off things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic romance yet you must realize that the story is timeless and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca s last name stratford their family is run by walter stratford pretty woman s larry miller a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor the family no dating policy is amended to bianca can date when katarina does with prom just ahead bianca s fate is grim unless of course she can tame the shrew don t think this mission to be a simple one as bianca kindly points out her sister is a particularly hideous breed of loser getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing when cameron who likes bianca learns of her father s new rule he is quick to consult a friend for advice the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit someone with money in this case that is joey the other guy with a crush on bianca cameron s friend a loser by teenage verdict convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe patrick verona heath ledger this verona is far from fair rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison moreover katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso hoping to nail his leftovers the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn t exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy a party polluted with liquor a best friend s betrayal and prom it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy american pie never been kissed carrie she s all that and can t hardly wait yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare falstaff was a drunk romeo and juliet met at a party and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way 
every year every year at the festival i wait for that film to come along that one that just pulls me out of my seat sticks its face up next to my nose and roars sur prise into my bewildered visage it s almost always a surprise it sure as niflheim was this time amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason and in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale where we roll our eyes occasionally smirk to ourselves and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a boy i wish that could happen sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash another e t another short circuit this film floored me for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough and presents itself well enough to make it more of an american folk tale with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time america has always had its mythical heros its paul bunyans and john waynes this film presents us with more general but still universal ideals the honest innocent children who have their own inner wisdom the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage honor and love for their respective sport the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding but has the grit to get things done when they need doin does the latter sound familiar amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters but it never leaves you with the feeling that it s artificial that it stands behind glass or that any sharp breeze or more importantly sharp thought will shatter the wax facade of the panorama this is a very sturdy scenario the principals are always given dialogue and always give performances always it just blows me away which made them seem real yet enforces their particular mythic role the writer producer david field seems to literally take all the yeah but in real life this would have happen thoughts you get in your head sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading in a stronger way then before astounding he uses obstacles to the plot to enforce it i am truly impressed indeed envious with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay it s so very unusual especially in a hollywood film i don t want to give too much away but the basic premise is that chuck joshua zuehlke the little league pitcher decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete a boston basketball player alex english amazing grace smith and well i m leaving it at that because i wouldn t spoil this film for you for the world let me just say this though i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply i don t give a rat s ass for the political point of view this film expresses one way or another i m recommending you go see this film because and only because it s an excellent story told with excellence no i don t believe what happens in this film could happen in real life while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted i believe in careful negotiations mutual verification etc screw what i think the point is this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen this is the natural and more all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion and a much better script to boot it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood and more importantly without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self consciousness special kudos to both zuehlke a real life little league pitcher who was picked for the part and english a forward for the denver nuggets for their seamless personification of their characters jamie lee curtis who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing s manager and friend william l peterson in a big change from his role in to live and die in l a as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it and gregory peck as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was and who some numbskulls still probably think he is 
after a successful run in australia last year and with much critical praise heaped upon it muriel s wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america muriel heslop is a withdrawn overweight young woman living in porpoise spit australia she is often the target of her father s frequent rants at the family and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage her self loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired after her four cliquey friends dump her muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls and muriel s wedding unfolds from there toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted collette gained a frightening pounds in order to play the chubby title character she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma easily winning the audience over with an honest painful performance collette basically carries the film appearing in almost every scene muriel s father bill the battler heslop is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician developer while chumming around with young fans and crowing you can t beat progress his slogan bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments rachel griffiths plays rhonda who becomes muriel s cheeky new friend in the film she has good chemistry with collette and the film suffers when griffiths is off screen muriel s tormenters played by pippa grandison rosalind hammond belinda jarrett and sophie lee are two dimensional caricatures all saucy vain and bumblingly spiteful though that is probably due to hogan s scripting muriel s wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm hogan s use of abba tunes which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack is interestingly appropriate although its repetitiveness tires after awhile hogan s script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel s earnest quest for acceptance and the gorgeous scene with muriel window shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch muriel s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p j hogan on my four star scale i give muriel s wedding three stars 
usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug but not the big lebowski the new offering from the creators of s critical hit fargo is to say the least wildly entertaining originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother s movies and the big lebowski is insanely original it begins oddly enough when jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is mistaken for a millionaire jeff the big lebowski david huddleston who s wife bunny tara reid owes money all over town two goons out to collect on bunny s debt break into dude s house they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team steve buscemi john goodman respectively he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug he does this and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper this is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments the coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly also several great supporting roles john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus the coen s script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of if you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one if not they give this one a try its a little different 
while it was part of former yugoslavia my country croatia used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general words croatia and croatians were unheard even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations the rare exception was the dogs of war adaptation of frederick forsyth s bestselling novel yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people probably terrorists who happen to remove parts of arm dealers stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business politics and crime the movie protagonist shannon christopher walken is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away after being arrested and tortured by kimba s secret police shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north colin blakely upon return he is approached by mining company again but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d etat against kimba shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies especially those made in s is its authenticity almost close to documentary it shouldn t surprise anyone because the author of the novel frederick forsyth made reputation by blending fiction with real life thus creating interesting exciting yet very believable plots for his books those plots were also responsible for few very successful s thrillers and one of them zinnemman s the day of the jackal is now considered a classic in that genre this one deals with soldiers of fortune ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of s and s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires unlike wild geese that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure script by george malko and gary de vore author whose death last year became real life mystery is serious and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work the movie doesn t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda christopher walken played in many movies yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role his performance in this film perhaps isn t breathtaking yet adequate his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned world weary man whose alienation from the normal way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends although the movie doesn t lack capable actors their roles are miniature compared with walken s and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character however those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war tom berenger paul freeman jo beth williams victoria tennant in brief cameo and biggest surprise is ed o neill of married with children fame as shannon s reluctant colleague this was the first major production for john irvin and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable yet second class director with the good script he can make very good movie with the bad script he can make real mess luckily the dogs of war had a good script irvin s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon used on the wrong places in the final battle scene where we can see mercenaries at work irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics unlike s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes unfortunately by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn t help but despite those shortcomings this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty realistic political drama 
when andy leaves for cowboy camp his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys one of these toys is wheezy a penguin with a broken squeaker woody tom hanks saddles up andy s dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy woody succeeds in his mission but doesn t make it back to the house before al the unscrupulous owner of al s toy barn recognizes woody as a rare collector s item and steals him buzz lightyear tim allen leads hamm john ratzenberger mr potato head don rickles slinky dog jim varney and rex wallace shawn into the city to find their friend meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped al has collected every piece of merchandising from the s tv puppet show woody s round up except for a woody doll now that the collection is complete al plans to sell woody and his round up gang bullseye the horse jessie the cowgirl joan cusack and stinky pete the old prospector kelsey grammer to a toy museum in japan the gang is happy about the move they ve been in storage for years waiting for woody if woody doesn t go with them they ll be closed up in a dark box again possibly forever trying to convince him to stay with them jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy buzz and the boys invade al s toy barn where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn t know he s a toy the new buzz generates the movie s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on zurg s fortress i e al s apartment building the original toy story won me over because its central themes reflected a grown up sensibility rather than the usual this is what we think kids want to hear while most kids movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill in toy story buzz discovered that he wasn t special that he was just like everyone else buzz sank into a suicidal depression but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy in other words it s okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we re not space rangers and we re never going to be toy story addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded abandoned or sealed up in a dark box in the attic this is another big grown up theme everything ends the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody s arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp on the shelf woody meets wheezy who s dusty broken and forgotten the other toys are shocked that woody has been shelved and they worry that woody s ride out to the cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt after he s stolen woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals of course in spite of the heavy themes toy story explores it s also very funny most of the laughs come from the toys assault on al s toy barn and on the apartment building the brief substitution of a new still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise i d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original most of the vocal performances are first rate tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work however one voice over also stands out as horribly miscast kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector although he does a lot of voice over work in commercials and on the simpsons as sideshow bob grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice he doesn t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete the animation is even better than in the first especially impressive were the textures of the figures we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic in the first movie the people looked just like the toys but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint we can also see that bo peep is porcelain as you can tell from the long winded phrasing common in the merchandising disney and pixar s toy story this is pixar s coming out party to celebrate they appended their first project a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball to the beginning of the movie they made the short in which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then on the downside toy story follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale and some sections tend to drag overall though i had a great time and found story to be a worthy successor to the first toy story bottom line this one really is fun for the whole family 
quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers after his pulp fiction many actors began receiving many offers for jobs john travolta made his come back and is now one of today s most bankable stars bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor jackie brown on the other hand boasts quite a well known cast except for the main lead pam grier most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films but she s never really had a breakthrough performance her first film was in the roger ebert written beyond the valley of the dolls that is until now jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction after mediocre acting jobs tarantino returns to what made his name a household one directing and writing jackie brown is the result and it is fantastic entertainment despite excellent direction from tarantino the cast steals the film giving one good performance after another pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent samuel l jackson bridget fonda michael keaton robert de niro and robert forster more than likely you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult as you really can t say much or you spoil it for everyone else i will tread lightly jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown grier in a blue outfit walking through the airport the camera tracks along with her and ends up revealing her occupation we are also introduced to ordell robbie jackson who sells illegal guns to interested buyers for a hefty price ms brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away however an fbi agent keaton and a local l a cop michael bowen are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money they try to reach him through beaumont livingston chris tucker one of ordell s buyers but he mysteriously ends up dead they try again through brown but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong doing but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell s friends fonda she is caught and sent to jail ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent max cherry forster and then wants to find out what she told the cops after she claims to have said nothing she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison ordell doesn t like this but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track this scheme seems to be going as planned but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown and that s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments and slang terms but they are always done very well and believably his hitmen are normally cruel but pleasant in that nasty sort of way they talk like normal people except for when doing business and they are rude to their girlfriends of course this is a tarantino film and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop of course tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film adding a lot of his reservoir dogs style storytelling to it things are told from one person s perspective and then from another and then from another each time learning more and more this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion which decides who is on whose side on the technical side of jackie brown quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his film however this time around it isn t as nearly as impressive or original the writing on the other hand is quite good although i do find tarantino s use of slang terms offensive the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction but it s much more easy to understand his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation but jackie brown is very simply to follow especially considering that the time is given during the leaps in time perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel rum punch by elmore leonard the dialogue is pretty much intelligent and all the characters are fully realized the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro who has worked with tarantino on previous films and the editing is very good and as with pulp fiction the music is a highlight bringing back memorable songs from the s and s the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable the performances are incredibly rich with hidden meaning behind every characters actions nothing is quite as it seems and you can t really tell which side one person is on the real treat of course is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits which play an important role in the film watching grieg i could tell what was going through her mind even if i didn t know what she was thinking her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad happy or in deep thought bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato i didn t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits her performance actually reminded me of heather graham s in boogie nights michael keaton comes across very well as does michael bowen chris tucker has a small but effective performance samuel l jackson is very good but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction although much less cynical but no matter jackson is very strong in his role robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times but overall he does a good job as one of ordell s perspective clients and friends robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film as he has one of the most developed characters he is present throughout most of the film and he holds his own against jackson and grier jackie brown is rated r for language sex violence drug use and some offensive remarks as a film by itself jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment with a complex plot to draw viewers in however one can not help but compare it to tarantino s pulp fiction and expect great results when compared it comes up short but not that short it s a worthy effort with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress i can t remember seeing her in anything except for a small role in mars attacks but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations and hopefully she will even be able to nab one 
david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director with his distinctive more often than not ingenious dialogue and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible some of them tend to be thickly layered deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message or sometimes even a concealed storyline and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors it is still a brilliantly complex consistently riveting motion picture about honor about sacrifice and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right oh and it s rated g incidentally this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else s work namely a play by terrence rattigan set in the th century he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow a rich aging man who finds out that his year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a shilling postal note did you do it he asks his boy no father i didn t ronnie answers that s enough for arthur who with his oldest daughter rebecca pidgeon immediately starts a crusade to bring his son s case to court they enlist the help of sir robert morton a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task it all seems fairly frivolous and no matter how you look at it the winslow case is not the trial of the century but arthur is determined to keep his family s word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that soon enough sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings so do we all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue but his style is still fairly apparent the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense but this is not mamet s norm and it s refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks gangsters as con men wonderful as those films were nigel hawthorne s performance is nearly flawless his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game we pity the man but we also like him rebecca pidgeon david mamet s wife who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur s oldest daughter a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women s suffrage movement the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one be honest did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill if you wanted to but didn t this is a movie for you it is the epitome of subtlety it s powerful without being too emotional sad without even trying to be depressing david mamet can churn out some great scripts but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too he is almost a national treasure his films deserve their own genre eugene novikov 
vampire films as well as other horror films are usually dumb and predictable b movies meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning but has also a plot worth making movies about based on anne rice s novel interview with a vampire is a long dark trip to hell the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present day san francisco the camera slowly find particular window a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness so you want me to tell you the story of my life the mysterious man is louis brad pitt a two century old vampire telling his story to a fascinated interviewer christian slater his tale opens in louisiana just south of new orleans where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat tom cruise given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead louis chooses the latter a decision he will forever regret everlasting life and eternal youth promised to him by lestat turn instead into never ending suffering damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat but to sate his hunger he must feed and the blood of animals is not enough eventually he pierces the neck of a grief stricken young girl named claudia kirsten dunst whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis for a while they are one big happy family but all things end and claudia s growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation when luis and claudia break loose from lestat they travel to paris where the euro vamps santiago stephen rea and armand antonio banderas who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned director neil jordan the crying game together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere as the film begins there is an incredible palette of colors beautiful sunrises lush golden fields green forests inky blue clouds and blending sun when luis is born to darkness everything suddenly changes to dark velvet lit only by the silver moonlight the beautiful production design by dante ferretti wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re create the multiple historical periods in the film from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the th century to our present days the casting is likewise good involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood ireland and spain the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective cruise is energetic sinister charismatic wild and bloodthirsty cruise s lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance with alarming swiftness the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror as his murderous purpose becomes clear kill them mercifully but do it you are what you are for do not doubt you are a killer that is how lestat is teaching luis but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages brad pitt is equally convincing as the vampire with a human soul antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective but since they play more or less secondary characters their performances are almost invisible the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character the world is changing around the little child but she does not she remains unchangeable a child for all eternity only her wise dark eyes reveal her age ironically the film s only miss is the script anne rice s novel is a very interesting read and her script is rich colorful and emotional but it is also tiering and too melancholic at times resembling a soap opera claudia is that what i should do let you go my father my luis who made me who will look after me my dark angel when you are gone luis everything will be alright claudia do you really believe that and then they hug emotionally moments like those displayed above and luis self pity is a bit tiresome however rice s script is otherwise strong and well structured bringing up humor and comic episodes that were more or less hidden in the book when lestat finds claudia s dead dressmaker whom she has killed he cries out who will make you that dress now be a little practical never in the house moments like that are both entertaining and appealing neil jordan s direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity homosexuality love and loneliness his gothic saga is not meant to scare but to display these issues differently wrapped up in mystery his new original picture brings vampire films to a new height 
every once in a while when an exceptional family film comes along i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children it is remarkable how many non disney films disappear in a couple of weeks now i see that in so doing i have unfairly ghettoized these films so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents but to anyone who wants to support smart funny energetic film making see matilda see it in a theater rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video see the best film i have seen in not the best children s film the best film period based on a story by roald dahl it tells of young matilda wormwood mara wilson an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents harry danny devito a crooked used car salesman and zinnia rhea perlman a simple minded bingo addict the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists and when they do it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books when they finally do send her to school it is to crunchem hall a bleak place run by cruel child hating miss agatha trunchbull pam ferris but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher miss honey embeth davidtz who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness matilda also discovers another special talent the ability to move things with her mind which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull s cruelty it was this spring s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton matilda soars on the cock eyed direction of danny devito devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses and he contributes some memorable images in one scene an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer later an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale it is also characteristic of the best children s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don t realize that they are learning them there is a hilarious moment when matilda s television addicted father snatches away the book she is reading in a wicked joke he thinks moby dick is pornographic and forces her to watch an inane game show hosted by jon lovitz in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child that because i m big and you re little i m right and you re wrong more specifically it has as its heroine an intelligent self confident girl who struggles successfully against other people s notions of how she should behave it is no coincidence that matilda was co written by robin swicord who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women finally matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word devito knows enough to make matilda fast paced and appealing to children taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy including a great chase through her dark house the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character but there are also many many delights for adults including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda s classmates recite in sing song fashion there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda s father i can t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling i will see it again and years from now i will watch it with my children and now i will stop because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin and there is a seat in that theater you should be in if you have a child or ever were a child 
i was anxious to see this for a long time a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell and he wanted to prove that she s as hot as he thinks he is he proved it for me all right but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that scream treads on familar ground horror movie with as star neve campbell puts it some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can t act who s always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door it s very familar your typical horror film so why you may ask after watching it does it seem so new and original because it treats itself as if it hasn t been done before and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old familar tired stuff this raises another question how does it do this simple the characters they re not your typical stupid horror film victims who don t know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette they are horror fans they know how stuff happens in a horror movie they know what to do and what not to do and that makes it scary and even funny at certain times you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker drew barrymore is making popcorn getting ready to watch a video and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that if she gets it wrong will get her and her boyfriend killed she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions she just can t answer his final question what door am i at and that gets her killed that scene works because in a normal horror film half the things that happen in that scene would never happen the plot is typical horror stuff sidney prescott an impressive neve campbell an attractive young high school student who s mother was killed a year ago tommorrow is being stalked by a killer who s previously murdered one of her classmates casey naturally and everybody in this small california town is a suspect including sidney s boyfriend billy loomis but as i said before these people know how horror movies work and that s what makes it so appealing that and the references to horror movies like when casey says the first nightmare on elm street was scary but the rest sucked which is obviously director wes craven who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others and when tatum sidney s friend mentions the director wes carpenter which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven but also director john carpenter the cast is well chosen neve campbell pulls off a good heroine and unlike most horror film heroines she can act drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film and david arquette is impressive also good and funny in his role is henry winkler the fonz as the school principal i took half a point off for the unnecessary albeit limited appearance by friends courteney cox as reporter gail edwards sidney s rival because she covered her mother s disappearance i hate that show i hate those actors they re untalented overexposed and overpaid imho and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough but i suppose he isn t 
oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with in a perfect world a civil action would be a breath of fresh air it s cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn t it s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book film isn t and the capper it has no distinct ending and the law in hollywood films is that above all else you must have an ending even if it s based on a true story a true story which hasn t yet ended you must supply an ending a false one but an ending nevertheless hell a civil action is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together and that includes the firm the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic yet it s also oddly and slightly unsatisfying weird this is in fact a steve zallian film not just the work of a hack and zallian is the director of the much admired search for bobby fischer didn t see it and writer of none other than schindler s list in short i like this guy and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories after all apart from the obvious it s a holocaust film and it s a spielberg film isn t schindler s list just a damn brilliant film not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study a civil action is the same way it s narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study and it s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong the main complaint of this film is that while yes it s an engrossing lawyerly tale it has no real ending and that s not necessarily the problem with the film it s that it s just kind of unsatisfying if this were a great film it would feel complete and still end basically the same way but this film just seems to end and i don t want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on imagine if you will being one of those the film is about looking forward to this film and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter just so the many won t bitch about what is essentially genuine but the fact that it just ends is not in all actuality what is wrong with it it s rather that zallian has chosen in the last half hour to adandon the traditional lawyer story and chose the other part of his story the one about the lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta who s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer brilliant because he s manipulative and he always wins it wishes to make it all about jan in the end but the truth is his change although nicely done is not full we see him suffering from a personal crisis and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart but in the end we don t fully believe it and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision the film choses an odd angle to go at a noble one but one that gives the film s conclusion that of incompleteness in the opening of the film we see him doing his old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases in short he s full of bullshit and we know it in the film he takes a case that is hardly desired a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river point one it s not of the usual criteria jan points out wickedly that dead or wounded children aren t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success point two it has been through several lawyers after turning them down jan changes his mind a muddled scene he stops his car on a bridge looks out is he feeling a sense of overachievement and he and his team of lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek and accountant william h macy head out to the town to do battle with the town s company they spend millions of dollars examining the land test the water what have you this is where stephen fry a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in wilde pops up thanklessly and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children and then unsuccessfully the workers at the plant they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company the eccentric jerome facher played by robert duvall more on him later on as we progress we get so involved in the way the story is being told which is engulfing everything around it including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland who lost her child who begins to have a personal crisis things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half as they are up against impossible odds the judge john lithgow is not only a strickler but a pal of facher the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify no concrete evidence is being found depsite the money spent to find it and they are quickly running out of money as macy mortgages everything he can including their homes and their office he slowly loses his sanity his meatiest role since oh fargo and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist in fact the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par owen gleiberman especially criticized the film for not being overly dramatic i suppose like a grisham novel this wouldn t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good he s seen as being still full of bullshit because he doesn t take stock in the cares of his partners and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out the final half tries to redeem this as must have been the point of making this in zallian s mind but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him and thusly receiving two speeding tickets we still feel that the big change in his life is that he s not rich and esteemed anymore the film s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case it s still going on you know but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life it only feels like half of that maybe even less and it s not travolta who does a great job here though never to be a truly memorable performance of his but rather zallian whose final chapter needs a rewrite up to then though it s an engrossing drama one of the best of the year in fact and one of the best lawyer films period the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted but rather it s about the lawyers the knights who battle eachother we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town but the reason it can t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find and duvall s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is facher is seen as an elderly man a goofy eccentric carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it eating lunches out of paper bags and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio and scold anyone who interupts him but look deeper and you see a master at work his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him and it s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way that s why i liked this film it s hard to put a pointer on you can never see exactly where this film will land and even when the credits roll you still aren t sure what to make of it call it the zallian effect same thing happened with schindler s list not that i m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman each film is so greatly crafted that you can t help but get involved in its broad storytelling interesting characters and most peculiarly the wit that comes along with it if only it felt totally complete like say schindler s list though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two it might have been one of the best films of the year and along with that a full breath of fresh air 
labelling is sometimes everything in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors producers weren t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones on the other hand producers were right on the mark walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america to make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based on anabasis historical book written by xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia years ago instead of ancient persia movie begins in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warriors local youth gang gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city the gathering organised by gramercy park riffs most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx that is far away from warriors home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce on the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riffs announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city crowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogues led by psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus police simultaneously raids the gathering and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing and their leader gets killed by riffs the remaining eight led by cleon s lieutenant swann michael beck must now try to get to coney island but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs upon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status however despite being one of the best movies of that year and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly if walter hill s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america he failed miserably the future was much worse than his vision the youth gangs as presented in the warriors are far from shadowy armies able to take over entire cities their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime in their vocabulary word arms is reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns they even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour despite those objections the warriors have all the elements of a very good film the plot is simple and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there isn t much bloodshed or gore in the movie editing is superb events happen at quick pace with the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would be girlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable yet the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity best known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains michael beck as cool almost statesman like leader of a gang is also very good and james remar gives good contrast as his hot shot contender for top spot all in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies 
the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics loved by the people and make tons of money at the box office this year the tradition continues with an update on the universal classic the mummy i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza in the mummy the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o connell he teams up with a curious clumsy librarian named evelyn played by rachel weisz to find the mysterious city of the dead hamunaptra evelyn loves egypt and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle and that s why she chose him to lead her there also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn s brother jonathan played by john hannah sliding doors now in hamunaptra the three uncover the book of the dead the curious evelyn unlocks the book reads from it and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep arnold vosloo becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book along with imhotep arising from the dead the ten curses of egypt become in full effect launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt don t expect huge things out of the mummy but just expect to have a good time this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects which may turn off some viewers on the other hand this type of film is one of my favorites but that s up to you to decide there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert swarms of beetles and locusts and even creatures crawling under a human s skin these may have been in other movies before but not like in the mummy as of now the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year but all this could change when star wars episode the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country in the past brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles when playing george in disney s george of the jungle he was mainly not known by anyone i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens in the mummy fraser gets to play an action hero and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle although brendan fraser is great rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast weisz really reminded me of a character from an old horror film the way she acts looked and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time evelyn is probably the only character that was likable considering that the other characters like john hannah s didn t get much personal attention in many films when different genres are mixed the mixing usually works and i like it for the most part in the mummy though not all of the mixing works there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror some with potential comedy some with potential drama and some with potential pure action but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work the mummy could have gotten an a rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these i didn t mind the corny one liners here and there during action sequences but it certainly could have done without them the cinematography is amazing in the mummy particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt mummies and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits the costumes are always top notch the bottom line with the mummy the summer is off to its usually great start 
the idea at the center of the devil s advocate which is thus far one of the three or four best films of is that no matter what decision is made evil will triumph god is a trickster satan is a humanist the last humanist he appears in many guises and seduces many men and women in his own words vanity by far my favorite sin al pacino plays this role with relish and gets to chew some delectable lines lemme givya a piece o inside wisdom on god i have a million names as john milton the devil the main idea that he can appear as anyone in any form in this case a buisness man harkens mainly back to terry gilliam s the time bandits but the film is something else something original part of what makes it so very good is that it never takes itself too seriously it dabbles with morality vanity death and child abuse but doesn t try to become any profound study of power this is a marvelous confection cocky funny thought provoking it is also entertaining there is no way you could possibly predict the ending it pulls back upon itself drawing purely out of the mind s eye the final shot is more creative more daring more challenging then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen s fargo the central themes are fascinating sometimes reminiscent of james the turn of the screw and oates accursed inhabitants of the house of bly and the product that is built around it really wows its nice to know that things like this are still being made 
let me open this one with a confession i love cop movies i adore them with such an unwavering near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers steven was it any good well just about as good as baldwin s steven seagal impression for those i ve confused the answer is a resounding no now let me clarify i don t love just any cop movie i m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the s and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker i m partial to those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem is these films come along just about as often as george w bush makes a cogent point so whenever a true cop movie does hit multiplexes i come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably i leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out for a movie called one tough cop which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin off no truth is i m a sucker for those barren streets that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops like modern day knights must shield us from their iniquitous clutches yes it s all very corny and awfully boys clubish which i m guessing is precisely where these feelings come from as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe s enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies etc the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos as an adult my tastes haven t changed all that drastically sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film but i still delight at the promise a guy film could potentially bring now what if it s the cops who re the corrupt ones ooh that one really gets me going these protectors using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain throw a courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city how absorbing is prince of the city you ask so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama a sub genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar i remained completely and utterly involved the film stars treat williams who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn t though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves like mickey rourke and eric roberts both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is a talented leading man who didn t make it to where he should have if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell here the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino s in serpico also directed by lumet williams plays danny ciello a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre juliani streets of new york they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done the squad relies entirely on informants low level junkies to gain access to the big wigs and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice danny has done this and though he s a fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a double agent he does so with one condition he will not rat on his partners right away we know that that is exactly what he ll have to do and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be undercover cop films are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliches like in too deep how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet as well as a handful of intense performances most notably by treat lumet s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back and lets the camera soak up the action his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension and he rarely holds for reaction shots instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking lumet s worst tendency is one that many film makers especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension this isn t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan lumet s most recent cop lawyer endeavor a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he was on sustaining tension in a film that runs for minutes with not one dull spot some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable of course cop movies aren t popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines but just look at the average hollywood action movies flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn t gay the lame comic relief character who s never funny and on and on for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills it focuses completely on its story and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies there s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human excuse me weak in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness straining to get the words out he s lost his voice does that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not to most but it sure made my night and in a sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence it s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things 
with more and more television shows having gay characters and even the infamous ellen sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines the birdcage was critically acclaimed as was this years chasing amy then along came in out and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released it s also noticeable that this alternative lifestyle becomes less and less taboo as the years go by and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort while it s a very serious issue to many it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety but the way we re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh at it is more and more becoming something we laugh with and when a movie like in out comes along it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy it doesn t poke fun at the lifestyle it simply uses it to all it s comedic capacity just as love sex marriage birth death and anything else has been the idea for in out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids afflicted gay man in philadelphia if you remember during his acceptance speech hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life it s a serious and touchy subject but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick it s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual it may have been more controversial but because it was written by an openly gay writer the prerogative was set kevin kline who only seems to become more and more acclaimed stars as howard brackett a high school english teacher in the small picturesque town of greenleaf indiana after a three year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery joan cusack a wedding date has been set and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story greenleaf high graduate cameron drake matt dillon is up for a best actor oscar the small town eagerly awaits both events and both seem quite astronomical but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other when cameron drake is announced the winner the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher mr brackett everyone is cheering back in greenleaf that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words and he s gay the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop the thing is nobody including howard can understand how cameron came to that conclusion and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf naturally the questions pour from howard s fiancee parents debbie reynolds wilford brimley students and the high school s principal tom halliwell bob newhart and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious howard is clean neat honest sincere a romantic and perhaps the most incriminating fact he loves barbara streisand the frenzy isn t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and entertainment tonight wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning one particular reporter is peter malloy tom selleck of inside entertainment who unlike the collage of other reporters wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett including coverage of his wedding the intrusion is all but welcome by howard who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute it seems that no matter where he turns a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees the dominoes begin to tumble as howard s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay it all sounds very devastating and it would be if it weren t presented with near perfection by one of this year s most delightful ensemble casts kline seems only to improve with age and he is downright perfect here the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine and they use it wonderfully every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever dillon has never been so likeable cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role and brimley reynolds and newhart all provide huge laughs when they re up to bat rudnick s script is heavily laced with wit and humor and you ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes while in out doesn t carry enough to give it four stars it remains one of the best done films of the year all around the script is exuberant the actors are absolutely top notch and we re allowed just the perfect blend of heart tugging so as not to bog down the laughs it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety yet we re still allowed a sappily touching ending despite it s subject matter and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex this is a movie that everyone could and should enjoy frank oz best known as a voice talent for muppets directs this film quite delightfully using all the potential rudnick s script has to offer which turns out to be quite a bit check this one out you ll have a gay old time 
errol morris critically acclaimed director of the documentary fast cheap and out of control vaults to new heights with mr death this film an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a leuchter jr is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise stunning even the more jaded minds among us don t let the film s cheesy dissuade you following this sideshow of horror lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter s life and mind morris follows the trail of leuchter s madness with appalling lucidity revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with this leuchter guy is seriously messed up virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries in spite of his lack of credentials after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows leuchter came to the attention of neo nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his theory that the holocaust never happened morris s interviews are surprisingly congenial drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch leuchter seems completely at ease sometimes jovial part of this effect may be due to morris s new interviewing machine called the interrotron which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer this was the first time morris had used the device and the results are startling combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter s reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant and you ve got one compelling and disturbing documentary while this film isn t for the feeble minded or weak hearted it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i for one feel bettered by the experience 
the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer director producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director he really is he wrote this film he directed this film he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after years has not lost it s popularity or it s ability to scare the wits out of people i think i have seen halloween over times and each time i find something new and brilliant and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen i own three different versions of the film a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition th anniversary t shirt a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow globe in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only and being truly good it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of copies i knew i had to buy one no matter what i did and man to me it s the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film no words can describe the dvd in halloween michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood years ago in now in grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield illinois followed by his past doctor sam loomis the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut why is he stalking her check out halloween ii it explains it all on this unholy night on october laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives which is trying to stay alive the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did what john carpenter did in is made a ground breaking new film with scares wit and style the movie is flawless if not perfect no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one and in my opinion never will halloween will be like psycho and still be extremely popular even almost years later i just hope someday halloween will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the extra scenes on the dvd edition halloween isn t just another slice and dice horror flick it s an intelligent horrifying and best film experience ever made see halloween and be scared then watch it again reviewed by brandon herring october 
in brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept the audience isn t stupid from that they went on and created the most plot driven intricately pieced movie in the last years the result the usual suspects one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist the story is convoluted and is really confusing to read although easy to follow on screen special investigator kujan chazz palminteri grills verbal kint kevin spacey a crippled con man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than victims kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis the rogue cop keaton gabriel byrne is actually dead kint relates the majority of the film in flashback beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police station lineup in new york city along with dour keaton kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus stephen baldwin mordantly sarcastic hockney kevin pollak and fenster benicio del toro whose speech is virtually incomprehensible together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from new york s finest taxi service crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins what follows is a shell game of violence and betrayal all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze the film is brilliantly compact its the shortest minutes you ll ever spend in a movie theater the cast is exceptional palminteri shines he is brutally honest a true cop one who is going after the whole story because its there byrne is terrific his brooding character his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro who is a riot as fenster del toro is brilliant his lines are a jumbled mess you can t understand a word the man says but it sure is damn funny baldwin is also very good he is careful methodical and cold a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot blooded sarcasm pollak is also terrific as usual a very good character actor however this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey spacey is simply breathtaking he is a force on screen giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze spacey s performance will be remembered for years for it is the best of his career it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last years verbal kint is a clever storyteller weak oppressed and gleefully evil to the bone yet pitiful one who draws sympathy the film is a good one a decent film until the last minutes what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history for me at least the revelation of keyser soze the closing gunfights it is something wondrous you have to see this movie about times to believe what they do kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful fast paced furiously plot driven movie with quirky characters phenomenal acting and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb without furnishing too many details he concocts his story and lets it run hoping the audience gets it at the end we do this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created kudos also to singer and john ottman who created the score they both create what is a true film noir setting carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final jarring ending there are flaws more questions raised than answers lack of character development and no strong female characters save one however the plot and that stunning ending make up for all the flaws and more if you haven t seen the movie rent it watch it then rewind the tape and watch it again trust me you ll be amazed 
 i d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation from elmer gantry on we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church well think again for the apostle which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister and by implication all the rest of organized religion instead it gives us a highly devout man who certainly has his foibles but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god and arguably just as surprising the good spirited film is no comedy even if it does have humorous moments instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures when in the privacy of his attic robert duvall as texas preacher euliss sonny dewey argues sternly with his lord the scene shares a kinship with emily watson s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves s most powerful scene the body of the story starts with sonny s coming upon an horrific auto accident which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters with his well worn bible in hand sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident s dying victims the scowling police officer orders him to go away and after he has tried to work his miracles sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord s work robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film s director writer executive producer and chief financier rarely has a movie been such a labor of love with a white suit peach colored shirt and tie and dark sunglasses sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher duvall has every movement down pat even when he is walking down the street the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy he dances and claps all the way sonny s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep voiced black orators but his rhetoric is always competitive i may be on the devil s hit list but i m on god s mailing list he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent and they lap it up people jump up scream praise the lord and mean it the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable but sonny is no saint it turns out that he has a wandering eye which angers his wife jessie played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny s church leaving him unemployed sonny letting his temper get the best of him does something foolish which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever the bulk of the film occurs in a small predominately black church in louisiana which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church one way road to heaven holiness temple with an enthusiastic flock in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e f the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church he asks his members to tithe but he gives all of his money and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks a man who can t stand to be still he tells one of his friends i quit school because i didn t like recess in his new town he meets toosie miranda richardson who like him has a family that she hasn t seen in a while his romance with the separated woman like the rest of the film doesn t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show s many surprising scenes again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take although it probably couldn t have ended any other way the movie does wrap things up nicely and don t miss the sweet epilogue during the film s closing credits a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film the apostle runs a little too long at it is rated pg for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up

bill condon s gods and monsters is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror classics frankenstein and bride of frankenstein since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but i suspect that much of it only came from whale s inner fantasies and hallucinations whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures decided fifteen years before his death at age to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him as the film tells it during the end of his life whale at his large home in l a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who was working as the gardener at his home james whale we learn quickly was what many people refer to him as in the film a dirty old man in one of the opening scenes a young film enthusiast visits whale s home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answers the young man must take off an article of clothing because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off clayon agrees and doesn t really think much of this much to the warnings of his friends becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis gods and monsters is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to as a motion picture director rather than a horror director and in one heartbreaking scene he attends a party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore it is evident that whale s first love in his life was making movies and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life as played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale comes off as a sad but dignified man and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others just as long as he knew he was being true to himself he never hid the fact that he was gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to while it means so much more to whale who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life although boone is only in a dead end job as a gardener of people s homes whale views him as the ideal man not only one that is good looking even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings but one that will actually listen to him since whale lives with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor although an extremely fine and mature picture a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments but it is a little thin and the structuring of the on again off again friendship at the film s center is fairly predictable we know early on where these two characters are headed and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds in lesser hands this set up might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this also a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again if the film was not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether gods and monsters is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who i sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end walking away from gods and monsters it was ian mckellen s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably it is a sad testament when a person s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one else s business in the first place 
eyes wide shut isn t the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick s final film but it is an impressive achievement a mesmerizing haunting adult psychodrama about marriage fidelity and sex it s a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end consistently exhibiting the auteur s trademark penchant for long continuous takes his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast indeed eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot kubrick a renowned perfectionist reportedly held his cast hostage on the set for nearly a year in an uncharacteristic maneuver kubrick cast two big name stars in the lead roles namely real life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman they play bill and alice harford a volatile couple who during the course of a couple nights ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other he is an m d she s unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party at the affair they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman after smoking a dash of weed inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night he truthfully says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story evidently some time ago she had a thing for a young naval officer she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night bill is jolted by alice s story and we anticipate his reaction but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go show his face at the house of a just deceased patient this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street then through a series of coincidences he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic and frankly creepy orgy takes place with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other erotic dread mounts as cruise who s not supposed to be there wonders the spacious halls watching the action until he is discovered to be an outsider much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros digitally edited the orgy scene with the help of a computer they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts they can still be seen just not in all their glory in order to avoid the dreaded nc rating european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it roger ebert calls the american version the austin powers version and many others have bashed the alterations i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene s mystical atmosphere the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks this is an artful distinctively gorgeous production shot in dark moody hues and featuring some elaborate beautiful scenery from the giant mansion used in the film s centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford s apartment this film is always a pleasure to look at to boot a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still at the core behind the graphic controversial content and unappealing mood this is a good natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic it s something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship at the end it seems bill s eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman tom is completely convincing as dr harford a man who seems guided solely by destiny with no control of the course his life will take nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective she s headed for an oscar nod the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast at the head of which is director cum thespian sidney pollock enigmatic and articulate as harford s mysterious friend eyes wide shut is not perfect the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander still this is an important work from a great director and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick s best it is a worthy final film a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness eugene novikov 
jay and silent bob strike back kevin smith s swan song to his two most famous characters is the best received comedy that i ve seen since there s something about mary which is a tea party in comparison to the foul mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back the audience didn t just laugh they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout in short if you like really raunchy humor you may find it as i did to be the funniest movie of the year on the other hand if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith s dogma then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you in one of the fastest paced movies of the year the story has jay and silent bob jason mewes and kevin smith a pair of card carrying drug dealers traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie it seems their comic book alter egos bluntman and chronic are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob s consent jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i ve ever seen among others they include carrie fisher as a bible toting nun mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell action best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was stupid enough to buy tickets to this movie actually purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet guilty although it s filled with inside jokes you ll still be laughing even if you only get some of them it s easy to understand enough so that they are still funny jay is a motor mouth who hasn t met a subject that he couldn t vulgarize his favorite topic is oral sex but being an equal opportunity profaner he s willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything but it is his buddy the aptly named silent bob who is responsible for most of the movie s success his reaction shots with his wildly exaggerated eye movements are comedic gems the story s main subplot concerns four animal rights activists justice shannon elizabeth and her three sexy buddies sissy eliza dushku missy jennifer schwalbach smith and chrissy ali larter these charlie s angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture jay tries to put the moves on justice but he doesn t stay in command of the situation for long one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink clam shaped birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry granted it s not the movie for everyone but if you like kevin smith s brand of humor you ll find that this is his best and as i said earlier it s the funniest movie of the year thus far no wait forget thus far it s bound to be the funniest movie of the year in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg so that they can rake in the maximum cash it s great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday august in the silicon valley it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters 
an energetic visually stunning but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d arc in history jeanne d arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors who can basically alter the story as they wish she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness director writer luc besson nikita leon portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain he shows her as a human being in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky and the air smelled of rotten flesh it is hard to keep your sanity the only support and hope is in god at the age of jeanne milla jovovich watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne s mind god is no longer her support he has become her obsession she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny with the help of the wise yolande d aragon faye dunaway and charles vii john malcovich whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo the movie is filled with dreamy symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere the film is lost in time and space hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne s thoughts imagination and conscience besson s visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle but the film is far from being flawless the script needs a lot of polishing except for jeanne there are no real characters and although a grand star cast is assembled their characters are nothing more than props not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing as for the maiden of lorraine herself she is portrayed as a simple girl too small for her divine task in the latter part of the film we see her as hysterical confused and on the brink of madness with her past purity and innocence for ever lost jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect but though her screen time is incredible excessive both malcovich being john malcovich and dunaway titus surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part besides casting jovovich besson s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder pillage and betray with a smile on their faces and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen represented by the three musketeers of this story the brave gilles de rais vincent cassel the wise aulon desmond harrington and the strong la hire richard ridings though all those actor perform well their characters are nothing more than symbols banners that proclaim the glory of france and thus there is no sense of realism in this film the messenger has muscles instead of brains there is some relief in the end where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking dustin hoffman s appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise jeanne s character is unlocked but whether god was in the picture or not is never quite explained was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge or was she truly a messenger of god the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious bess o messenger is nothing more than a fairly good film it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater maybe the sound the dreamy sequences but certainly not the dialogue it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv generation that although presents some interesting material works better when it s on the battlefield 
just look back two years ago at the coen brothers comedic gem the big lebowski change the actors take away the bowling alley add a record store and you ve got high fidelity or maybe the other way around since nick hornby s novel high fidelity came first either way it s been done before a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances yet it remains consistently funny why is this maybe because you know your life is much better than this you know these guys are more pathetic than you are and you know its ok to laugh at them because they re fictional director stephen frears possibly not intentionally has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day when watching high fidelity expect to laugh at someone else s pain realize what you are laughing at and then laugh again i laughed at dick todd louiso the shy timorous steve buscemi character of lebowski who seems to know what he is talking about but either can t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends i laughed at the john goodman character barry jack black an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons pudgy egotistic and obnoxious at the same time and i laughed at rob john cusack the jeff bridges type whom the story revolves around rob is the character easiest to relate to but he is nothing like you at all he uncontrollably cheats and lies then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman and like his other miserable friends pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it whatever human emotions the clash aretha franklin and bruce springsteen records hold rob and co grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him but these aren t any girlfriends these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob rob s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life the plot in three words is women and music the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective it gives high fidelity a quickly paced informal structure adjectives which perfectly parallel rob s own lifestyle it also helps open the viewer s eyes as to how annoying barry is jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob who must work with him every day of the week what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast consisting of big stars and character actors that really defines rob now instead of rob just talking to the camera after he explains something the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn t end when it should have ended instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie high fidelity is a cheerful old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen they make everyone look and feel great 
one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel that concept although many purists doubt its scientific credentials spawned many interesting novels comic books and films in the last century however the big grand daddy of time travels h g wells novel the time machine wasn t written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences the author h g wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich idle capitalist class and impoverished labour whatever intentions wells had the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration first of them was george pal who in directed film which would through the years become genre classic of its own the plot revolves about george rod taylor victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension time at the eve of the new th century george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention machine that would enable him to travel through time they are skeptical but that doesn t prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future at first he travels slowly seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars finally after witnessing world war three he travels far into the future hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions when he finally reaches year ad at first glance new world looks like utopia humanity consists of young beautiful but idle eloi people who are fed clothed and taken care of by unseen machines but weena yvette mimieux eloi woman tells george about another side of the coin in the night her people is preyed upon by morlocs humanoid creatures from the underworld the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times for h g wells it was frightening threat of class struggle for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie even the modern audience which would be tempted to discard the film as old fashioned could find some values in its universal messages fit for each era compared with the genre films of today the time machine is even better and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent thought provoking films of course since this is hollywood product after all the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness for example it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today some of the final scenes that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero are also rather unconvincing but on the other hand the film is very well directed cleverly paced and the special effects although definitely old fashioned are more than adequate for this kind of picture the acting is good with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george s trusted friend filby yvette mimieux who plays weena on the other hand would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role however despite all those flaws the time machine is a very good piece of cinema something that connoisseurs of quality science fiction films sorely miss these days 
eric rohmer s pauline at the beach is one of those small deliberately paced but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise but a lot happens to the characters emotionally the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast and centers on six different characters primarily pauline amanda langlet a wise beyond her years year old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin marion arielle dombasle on the first day at the beach marion runs into an old high school flame fedoore atkine and although he wants to rekindle their relationship she is more interested in an older more seductive womanizer pascal greggory who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor rosette while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy simon de la brosse pauline at the beach is not a film in which big dramatic things occur and there is not a clear cut tidy conclusion to the story instead it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life and the surprises come from little character details the film is quite talky and slow moving and so it is pretty safe to say it isn t for those who are only a fan of action movies but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big budget genre and see a good art film this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer s my night at mauds and s claire s knee that i have seen but his direction is assured and intelligent as is the screenplay which he also wrote pauline at the beach is a film worth seeing 
some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen i finished mike figgis leaving las vegas hours ago and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr alot of people refer to this film as that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude leaving las vegas is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are a drunk and a whore ben nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years is the drunk his family and friends have long since abandon him and all he has left is his liquor in a scene early in the film we see ben staggering into a resteraunt looking for a friend of his to mooch some money off of he finds the guy richard lewis having dinner with a buddy and two chicks trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid when ben approaches the table you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable after lewis gives ben the money he coldly says i think it would be best if you didn t contact me again now even though through the course of the film some much more depressing things happen this is when i felt the most for ben there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face not to sound hokey or anything it almost brought a tear to my eye it turns out that ben was once a semi successful hollywood player and apparently a pretty popular guy now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women not so much for the sex but for the company for someone to talk to or spend time with once he is fired from his job ben decides to burn all his belongings collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death one night he runs into a prostitute a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue how far she has come since adventures in babysitting named sera she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp a scumbag who gets off by cutting her they are both very lonely self destructive people they immediatly hit it off both of them realizing that they need one another and it isn t even a sexual relationship they don t even have sex until like the last ten minutes of the film leaving las vegas is not a film about plot with the exception of what i have already revealed which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so by the way there isn t too much of a story to it it is more a film about people and how they react to one another from what i can see this is basically a perfect film the direction is great with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody smokey atmosphere of a film noir and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the s or any other decade for that matter but don t go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you re getting yourself into first off if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge stay away from leaving las vegas it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon that s right secondly if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film don t see it however if you are cool with those two things you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have 
 crazy beautiful suffers from the damned if you do damned if you don t syndrome after a spate of flighty cookie cutter teen films the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story but rather than applaud the production early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown afterschool special even worse in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people the studio got a case of the heebie jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re shoot scenes and cut footage to tone things down needless to say the filmmaker was frustrated we were trying to make a cautionary tale he told newsweek and we couldn t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from regardless the film works thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes crazy beautiful is quality fare good enough that i half expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes set in pacific palisades calif the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens every morning and evening carlos nunez jay hernandez takes a two hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school an honor student and star athlete carlos is responsible modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy all is well until he meets nicole oakley kirsten dunst the daughter of a rich congressman bruce davison nicole is a drunk apparently hell bent on self destruction carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her but he is only human and she has the greatest smile plus as her father notes she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral as with save the last dance crazy beautiful god how i hate lower case titles takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh while noting the racial and social differences between the kids the screenplay dances around most of the clich s there are still several mtv moments though the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there cute as a button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole s behavior she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down i hoped the boy would listen as carlos hernandez is a revelation hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team the young man can really act we will see a lot of this guy in the future aside from its title the biggest problem with crazy beautiful is its ending which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy after carefully presenting credible characters and situations the conclusion feels rushed and lazy still this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots afterschool special my ass crazy beautiful is the real deal 
 remember what the mpaa says horrific and deplorable violence is ok as long as you don t say any naughty words featuring the voice talents of matt stone trey parker mary kay bergman rated r filmmakers jump on real life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up and already someone s made a movie about it and it s not thank god a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy instead we get a sharp biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed based on a popular and controversial cable tv show south park bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r rated movie and learn some naughty words when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms they decide to blame canada wage war against the neighbor country and execute terrence and phillip the flatulent actors in the obscene film the kids form an alliance they name la resistance with the accent on the third syllable of resistance to save their favorite thespians in a hilarious spoof of tribute to les mis rables in a subplot one of the characters kenny who else dies and goes to hell where he meets satan satan and saddam hussein are lovers you see satan is a benevolent soul while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex apparently too if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth aside from being a brilliant satire south park is also an all stops out musical with unforgettable numbers like shut your f ing face uncle f er and cartman s mom is a big fat bitch almost invariably it s funny stuff often juvenile but always funny the same can be said for the rest of the movie it s intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner i e toilet humor endless profanity etc not that there s anything wrong with that vulgarity when done right is my bag baby trey parker and matt stone the twenty somethings behind the film and the show paint a bulls eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa s rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren t uttered the auteurs throw some nasty one liner insults their way the ratings a plenty association isn t the only target of this unsparing banter people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game with the blame canada plot being a not so cheap shot at them the distinctively low tech cardboard animation is oddly effective even more so than the state of the art deep canvas technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan it s more pleasant to look at less intimidating up on the screen and most importantly it doesn t detract from the film s concept as much as disney s admirably awe inspiring work does the show s popularity has been waning as of late and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings perhaps not having seen the show on numerous occasions i can say that it s not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years parker and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask must the show go on eugene novikov 
this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers all of his movies have one main thing in common they don t skimp on the violence in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn t get shot once in the chest he gets shot many times all over the body robocop takes place in detroit in the future things are pretty bleak the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner nancy allen peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed model robot crime fighter someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off but plot twists keep it exciting the acting is bad from weller when he is human but very good when he is robocop nancy allen does a decent job this movie doesn t leave itself open for a sequel exactly but they made one anyway enter robocop starring peter weller and nancy allen directed by irvin kershner detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film ocp is trying to develop an improved robocop that will be more than a match for criminals most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over leaving robocop to be the police force in the city this film is pretty bizaare it has a year old drug lord who curses as much as eddie murphy even more violence than the original and some more humor the plot of this movie is pretty large almost too much so there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don t really match up the effects are still decent though this sequel isn t more of the same really just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals if you liked the first one watch this but be dissapointed so later comes robocop starring nancy allen and robert john burke ocp is now owned by a large japanese company robocop joins a band of rebels to counter attack the evil empire i mean ocp the japanese send a cyborg ninja to deal with robocop among other things this movie is easier to follow than the last one which means the plot isn t quite as crowded this movie isn t anything special though just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid friendly way really not reccomended 
john von neumann progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos even without recourse to faster than light travel you send out self replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information it may take decades centuries or millennia but it can be done with achievable technology and doesn t require a magical faster than light drive in the fifties british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer which would then engage in a real time dialog with the aliens exchanging information and technologies and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned about thirty five years ago the bbc contracted with astronomer writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini series called a for andromeda afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission the construction of a huge computer the computer s analysis of life on earth and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then unknown julie christie audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel andromeda breakthrough which played to equally high ratings dennis feldman whose previous credits include the golden child has never been noted for coherent well structured movie scripts they start out great and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl feldman writes good scenes but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie even with a previous version to use as a model now in species we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter gore and chases species features ben kingsley who is completely wasted in a badly written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script the species story is relatively simple we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since and have been receiving answers for two years note that in the s we really didn t know diddly about the human genome structure and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings even today all we can do is give information about dna and how it works not a copy of human dna because we don t have it analyzed yet the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race and doctor xavier finch played by ben kingsley is placed in charge of the attempt the script begins to go off the deep end at this point when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape shift into any of several ugly alien life forms the first half of the film has something to offer as sil the alien girl struggles with her multi form existence changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society with glaring gaps where her social skills should be her instincts are to mate and procreate and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area escaping from her birth laboratory in utah sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her she goes on an eating binge spins herself a cocoon and emerges as an adult played by natasha henstridge who goes a long way toward re creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in the pursuers michael madsen is an assassin exterminator forrest whitaker is a convenient empath psychic just as though the u s government actually had such people on call neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided whitaker s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek the next generation s counselor cleavage the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals too good to not work to the best of their abilities but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak h r giger s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly the main fault of species is lack of originality it starts out with a wonderful albeit borrowed premise and then doesn t live up to it all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes with a few monsters tossed in there is no buildup of tension and suspense no climax worthy of the name species is just a sequence of scare scenes stuck together the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes but not rescued by them on the other hand as an exercise in sci fi action adventure it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board but by and large it s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing my personal rating is three stars but knock one or two of those off if you don t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and

 from the man who presented us with henry the portrait of a serial killer comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida s south coast plot guidance counselor dillon is accused of raping one of his students she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida the counselor is brought to court on the charges as another white trash girl campbell also joins the rape finger pointing club as the story unfolds we find that many things aren t exactly as they seem that s as much as i could say without ruining anything critique good little flick that slows down at certain points and runs a tad long but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout mind you i could see many people not liking it because it takes one too many twists and turns but hey i happen to like that kind of thing and besides the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability or scathingly close to and even explained many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film do not leave the theatre before you see the credits it really does clear up some stuff other than that the acting was good with campbell transforming her good girl stereotypical role into a pot smoking goth looking white trash chick out for a good time denise richards from starship troopers fame solidifies herself as hollywood s jelly donut pinup girl of the moment and proves that all breast implants needn t lead to lawsuits bacon is solid and so is dillon while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world sprinkle the story with a bunch o shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters bacon showing the world the size of his ding dong do we really need to see this a couple of lesbian kissing scenes and a menage a trois and you ve got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre on the down side the soundtrack was not as prominent or slick as i thought it would be and theresa russell real name theresa paup seems to have lost her way in every which way possible ooooh i almost forgot bill murray s exquisite role as the down trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex greed and mystery little known facts neve campbell specified a non nudity clause in her contract she s also born in guelph ontario go hoser director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together as it was gratuitous kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother called the bacon brothers is married to actress kyra sedgwick and has a game based on him called six degrees of kevin bacon 
based on the relatively unknown in comparison to spider man marvel comic book blade tells the story of half vampire half human played by wesley snipes who was born of a vampire s latest meal now swearing vengeance against all vampires blade hunts them all his latest challenge is his biggest though he must stop the vampire deacon frost played by stephen dorff from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires admitedly comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums often viewed as juvenile by most standards even seen as illiterate by some judging by a series of poorly recieved financial and critical comic book based films such as batman and robin steel barb wire the crow city of angels and the list goes on one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film to some degree i agree with this sentiment having read comic books since the age of nine i m right now i can count the number of good comic book based movies not including japanese manga one hand the crow batman superman the mask and now blade men in black is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book why is this for the most part it is because the filmmakers understand the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere which the director provided the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics which the casting and cg effects reflect superman is not over the top with colour and flash and the film reflects this blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film creating an appropriate atmosphere this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher s contrived vision in batman and robin reflecting the dated atmosphere in the s television show batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact comics have grown up and so has the audience i m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i m ready which brings me back to blade although he may be a familiar character to some due to his appearances in the spider man animated show on fox one will find no single trace of the warm and fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends the end results are not pretty by any means the story elements work very well for a comic book story screenwriter david goyer who also wrote the crow incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films this is presented through karen a hematologist portrayed by n bushe wright this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires add this to the neat little gadgets that blade uses including a titanium sword complete with an anti theft device and one has an interesting premise however the film works best as an action film actor wesley snipes has an extensive background in martial arts most of which comes from capoeira a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks choreographing every single move proving that quick flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences see batman and robin for a good example of that wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes regardless this film is far from perfect the film suffers from at least one major plot hole regarding the summoning of the blood god the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on marked squares yet one of them is viciously murdered allowing the ritual to pass and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square obvious continuity errors also surface especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame there is no trace of smoke either much of the special effects are not that spectacular either while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch other cgi computer generated imagery effects are almost slapped together which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released the film s release date was pushed back multiple times scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake knocking the believability factor down a few notches but then i m really hard to impress the film s r rating comes from gory violence but the lack of realism made me wonder why it got such a rating for realistic violence watch saving private ryan the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi still scenes involving non cgi special effects do surface and look much more impressive such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade s sword without deactivating the anti theft device wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess while not talking much he is a grand physical presence leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust a decent by comic book film standards storyline also helps 
do film critics have morals are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow naturally we don t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish secondly and along the same line we can t prejudge a film because of it s stars director etc the difference well in the first one we d go into a film thinking it s going to be dumb or it s going to be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb so i m not expecting much on the second hand we re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal grudge against the film company it s made by disney oh it s just a merchandising ploy then the actors jim carrey s in it it s gonna stink or the director who can t be that good this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint make sense ok but what about comparing isn t that kind of along the same lines when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer s credibility in one film to another they were involved in is that really fair sure in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more but what about jackie brown for example is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both i think it is and i ll tell you why a good critic should be able to view the film from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film sometimes that can be tough the acting was superb but i was bored or i loved it it was sooooo cheezy might be used to describe a film these are contradictions and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique but which is more important and which is better an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again getting back to the point my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway every average person out there who s interested in this film is likely to ask how does it compare to pulp fiction and so as a critic i m already responsible to ask that same question jackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the s who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character tarantino s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta s sudden revival in the movie industry and with talks of an oscar nomination the same is likely to happen for grier we ve made it thru comparison jackie is a year old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fiction s samuel l jackson and comparison ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half million dollars trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotics as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell s plans and not as friendly intended as we d hope he posts jackie s bail after she is put behind bars the thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and as we learn from his previous actions he s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze ordell won t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she s always done yet at the same time a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided it comes down to a simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help the law ordell or maybe just herself coming into play is another s veteran robert forster as jackie s bail bondsmen max cherry max s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance also involved is ordell s surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda a ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role but there s nothing more to her and therefore she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself de niro is a brilliant actor but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn t need a de niro to play him compared to pulp fiction comparison the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable in pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast the exception being grier tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth sadly grier too could have received a bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newly jarred perception of life jackson teams up with tarantino again but the chemical reaction isn t as awesome as the first time jules was the rambling bible quoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off and although jackson is really really good in jackie brown i don t think he s quite as irreplaceable in fact maybe a new face would have been better jackson could ve remained tarantino s jules and a new guy could have become ordell forever to remain so in our memories sadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just isn t as impressive and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning this is grier s film so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard s novel rum punch for those movie goers don t expect another pulp fiction and you ll be satisfied for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of s film making the directing has toned down a bit however yet we re still reminded that this is tarantino s movie thanks to odd split screen story telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints so getting back to the question that i began with this isn t pulp fiction at all it s good but it isn t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place this is a more conservative tarantino but not one that won t satiate true fans if you can realize that this isn t going to knock your socks off then you ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet after all we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy 
catherine deane jennifer lopez is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma but the boy s parents aren t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life as if trying to assure the boy s parents wasn t hard enough on her a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane s mental faculties a vicious serial killer named carl stargher vincent d onofrio has been kidnapping women locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life sized dolls just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia the police led by fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim s body but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state in a last ditch attempt they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell a cell which will completely fill with water in the next hours initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix while it does share some characteristics with both films particularly the first forty minutes which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm the buzz around this project is that first time feature film director tarsem singh who won many awards for his video of r e m s losing my religion wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story and a good portion of this film supports that theory despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments the cell does feature some remarkable imagery all of the sequences where we delve into someone s mind are incredibly beautiful including the dank mind of stargher whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h r giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe the first sequence that takes place in stargher s mind is by far the best featuring one of the most ingenious traps i ve ever seen in a film involving a horse which no one seeing this film will probably forget a zoo like display of stargher s victims which are animated like marionettes and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant but alas the sequences only become more silly as they go along despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images but at least vincent d onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance magnified by ten thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed in my opinion d onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful i e the newton boys feeling minnesota the thirteenth floor and the velocity of gary that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film as it contains heavy doses of both besides the nipple ring removal i mention above there is also stargher s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs prior to his catatonia and capture which will have audiences recoiling a sequence where catherine enters stargher s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit like device as a narrative film the cell is sorely lacking as a collection of images though the cell is extremely well done although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half singh has done what he supposedly set out to do make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together unfortunately a well written script should have been considered too because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv provided of course that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos

review ghost dog the way of the samurai cast forest whitaker henry silva cliff gorman john tormey gene riffini victor argo tricia vessey isaach de bankole camille winbush director jim jarmusch writer jim jarmusch rating good shot stars languid yet pointed and focused ghost dog the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek ultra cool cinematic image of the hitman juxtaposing the samurai s honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american italian mafia it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor s precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber dinosaur like to function in the modern era director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit using a palate of bleached colors jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film he doesn t cater to audience expectations of hyper colorized stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies the action is presented in flat brutal codas bullets have permanence death has consequences the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty it is an anti movie of sorts there are few photogenic empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with this isn t a film that lovingly holds your hand there are dark contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder just so asserting itself for all to see the fulcrum for the movie s thematic balancing act is ghost dog a mafia hitman a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms unlike the sleek muscular killing machines one is accustomed to we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly replete with chapped dirty hands and rumpled clothing he wears a hooded sweatshirt which he often pulls over his head giving him a monk like appearance there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal he uses old worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical efficient and pleasureless fashion ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book which he reads daily hagakure the way of the samurai life consists of simple pleasures for him ice cream warm rooftop naps and good books ghost dog lives as it were by the basic tenet expressed by his book one should start each day considering oneself as dead living atop an abandoned building surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends he craves nothing more as he puts it late in the film i ve seen all i want to see he exists in a spiritual world of the mind gaining moral sustenance from his readings ghost dog wasn t always as he is presented in several roshomon like flashbacks it s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan that samaritan being a foot soldier in an aging crime family ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man louie tormey as repayment after years of loyal service ghost dog is sent by louie to kill handsome frank a made man within louie s organization who has run away with the crime boss s daughter louise vessey ghost dog wordlessly executes his task witnessed by louise whom he spares as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon clutching a copy of the book roshomon in a bit of synchronicity louise loans the book to ghost dog upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family the mob bosses in turn put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog s world each time a character is shown watching a cartoon it s from the same era betty boop felix the cat etc a reflection of days gone by near the end louise is watching a cartoon that s a departure from the previously shown ones it s a bit of audacity on jarmusch s part that is nicely effective despite it s surrealistic nature as ghost dog floats through his world his life is touched by two people one is a sage little girl winbush who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities just as louise ultimately does by film s end the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer the other person in ghost dog s world is an ice cream de bankole vendor who only speaks french yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land jarmusch through rapper composer rza underscores his film with rap and reggae music which at first blush seems dichotomous but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars which in and of itself presents another paradox about ghost s dog s sense of honor the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation of all the cartoonish mobsters he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world gorman plays sonny a lieutenant who respects the old ways yet has a quirky affinity for rap music a love comically shown in several impromptu displays ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia he is a husk of a man assisted by two hearing aids who barks out advice without truly hearing what he or others are saying whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor s use his face ghost dog is reticent to speak often going for long periods without doing so the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent although the film has a deliberate pace some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon into a figure that garners sympathy if not a bit of pity 
the italian hitchcock and acknowledged master of the giallo murder mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino jennifer connelly a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school s population terrified a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist donald pleasance leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift phenomena is an imaginative original thriller writer director argento creates several sequences of surreal haunting beauty here including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer s beckoning the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer s identity is genuinely shocking and surprising the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden ex rolling stone bill wyman and argento s favourite gothic electronic outfit goblin but it gels surprisingly well the film s opening music reccurs several times an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone argento fans beware the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re titled as creepers this deleted nearly half an hour of footage mainly of key dialogue scenes

carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town she goes to college in california there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore who is a city boy when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving she brings shore with her and her parents lane smith and cindy pickett are less than thrilled dan gauthier gugino s boyfriend from high school proposes to gugino gugino isn t ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end forget jurassic park cliffhanger the firm and last action hero son in law is the film to see this summer son in law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers especially fans of the wiez when son in law is long gone and forgotten the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen although the basic story line has been done many many times before the film is still fun to watch the laughs are plentiful especially when the wiez is around the way some of the jokes are done are new even though some of the jokes are old there are also several new jokes that at least i haven t seen before still when presented right even old material can be funny still this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn t contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price the cast for this film does an excellent job pauly shore encino man is the star attraction of this film he is great and knows how to entertain the audience pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl she makes her character believable on some levels yet interesting at the same time the person who played the grandfather mason adams i believe also does a great job the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen patrick renna who played gugino s little brother was a little annoying but no where as near as macaulay culkin and for only part of the time so i can forgive him tiffani amber thiessen a killer among friends saved by the bell does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television she wasn t given overly much to do in the film but what she had she does a good job with 
it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system no major surprise when j s mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority small wonder that hollywood s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual underdog against some larger collective oppressive witness braveheart born on the fourth of july rocky first blood clear and present danger jfk the list goes on there s little of that in singapore we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line though the government s been long worried about the younger people getting americanised and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition the people vs larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america sex does pornography have a right to exist and circulate larry flynt the publisher of hustler magazine thinks so and obviously so too the u s congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net but even with such actions americans remain undecided the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire what they have ignored is actually a great picture woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to hell with morality to hell with the law and to hell with the system anti christ that we last saw in natural born killers and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex stripper wife dearly the latter is played with abandon conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination if not of the award itself edward norton plays their jerky lawyer the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox superficially they are immoral outcasts who ve had it coming woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down and courtney dies of aids god s damnation but in the powerful love they have for each other each standing by the other in turn the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and in the american context a christian if they can love and care and feel just like anyone else on a personal level friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral christian influences to go beyond good and evil this is a great picture no doubt and i love it personally because it is moving funny ends with open american optimism blah blah but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities this movie is not so much about larry flynt but about americans and american society 
seen april at p m at crossgates cinema guilderland n y theater by myself for free using my hoyts critic s pass theater rating very good seats sound and picture do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you ve just become part of a story everyone has their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but a part nevertheless that seems to be the basic theory behind go where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn t usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them such as a teenage supermarket cashier a bottom of the drug food chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors these types of characters might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father a mid level drug dealer a narc obsessed with multi level marketing horny wedding guests a zen lovemaker two shrimp scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out how they will all come together is the process the film deals with i d imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general the film starts out as anything else with little indication of what s to come we meet ronna polley a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn t seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent she s not very charming especially to her customers but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works maybe this is because she s not a very afeminite character but she s far from masculine a creative character indeed things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences this agreement starts a three pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death nearly the same can be said for two other characters zack mohr and adam wolf who we don t think much of when they first appear as supporting characters but later will become major players to the film s makeup another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene it s clear this film isn t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling considering how good it is up until that point it s a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today and so the film begins to take shape first by following ronna and her friends on a one night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which doesn t exactly go as planned but that s what keeps it all so interesting the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna s story but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead simon and his three friends head to vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined the third arc about zack and adam again overlaps with ronna s story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle we re shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren t even their fault they just happened to be where they were when they were i d really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven t seen the film perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking still i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well direction trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman it s a great accomplishment he doesn t just depict a story he wraps us up in it all pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general it s clear the script has been inspired by many sources with both obvious and subtle references yet it never screams rip off tone mood where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre it s not overly dark or twisted and the comedy isn t so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy more like macabre light cinematography art direction able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture we re able to get a sense of who they are what they re thinking and how they came to be in their situations even when their actions are surprising it never seems very out of synch performances every actor nails their role see above theme theory the film doesn t seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages instead it s more of a philosophical experiment in fact it might not have meant to do that intentionally but there definitely is something existential to it all and to think that go is just a big comedy and adventure see also the big lebowski clerks jackie brown pulp fiction true romance also by liman swingers 
 through a spyglass i could see everything king louis xvi was beheaded on january but instead of visualizing this act of regicide legendary auteur eric rohmer s the lady and the duke observes from afar consider it a view to a kill made abstract a proper british yes british gentlewoman grace elliott lucy russell and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope often muttering i don t know as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air what we don t see might not be able to hurt us just close your eyes and think of england during times of revolution the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them adapted from elliott s memoirs journal of my life during the french revolution rohmer s latest artistic tour de force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies tales of the four seasons etc a period film set during the most violent changes in french history resisting the temptation for grand scale theatrics much of the lady and the duke is about quiet decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist a headstrong snobbish blueblood one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own grace s life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover the king s hot blooded cousin prince philipe duke of orleans jean claude dreyfus the times are changing though and the gears inch ever closer toward violence during the september massacres of she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke s sister in law on a stake rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil old fashioned almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob in doing so he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not the face of death when grace sees her friend s disembodied head on a pole rohmer s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman s reaction shot laden with hot tears grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice sheltering him from the mob through her relationship with the duke she seeks a passport for this one activist s escape grace doesn t even understand her own actions and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers ceaseless police monitoring house searches even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life her imperious attitude to the servants never changes she becomes a heroine through circumstance the events themselves are intrusions upon her person her home and therefore her values aristocracy proves a glass house one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones the duke is called to vote on the king s punishment and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors talk means nothing in the face of bloody action or futile inaction the episodic structure creates a wobbly jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification lazy viewers and critics may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke that s foolery but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer s characters occasionally become didactic rohmer s imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism the actors were filmed against a bluescreen then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of th century paris this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide open streets it looks as phony as titanic but unlike james cameron s debacle the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone why they aren t real the very foundation rohmer s characters stand upon is false and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves in all their insubstantial glory screened at the new york film festival feature coming soon 
wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon denise richards and neve campbell that deals with all the issues sex love murder and betrayal the setting of the film is a town named blue bay it consists of many swamps and slums and on the other hand rich estates owned by the town s different benefactors the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town s ritzy expensive high school it is here that we meet all of the core characters there s guidance counselor sam lombardo police officers ray duquette and gloria perez dark mysterious senior suzie toller and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor but none more than kelly throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape shortly after suzie too confesses that sam raped her as well this pushes kelly s sex craving mother sandra to stop at nothing until sam is convicted during the trial kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her however it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor after sam is cleared kelly s mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her it is then revealed that sam kelly and suzie were all in on it together it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda matt dillon stars as sam lombardo sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage he isn t the obvious best of actors but dillon does give a convincing performance however his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles although he never had many to start out with in the first place neve campbell who most people relate to scream and scream plays blue bay outcast suzie toller suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film campbell is very successful with this character adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch playing kelly van ryan is denise richards kelly is your typical rich sexy head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses like her sexpot mother sandra one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother denise richards still hot off the press from starship troopers gives the most interesting performance in the entire film in the beginning kelly looks to be a paper thin character but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy but dominating as well kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette this character looks to be one of the most boring predictable in the film however it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story still the film doesn t seem to gain much from bacon s performance only his name in the supporting cast theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan daphne rubin vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez and bill murray shines as sam s lawyer ken bowden hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller the eroticism which is portrayed with good taste is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it s share of twists 
in daylight sylvester stallone breaks no new ground cinematically speaking but he covers familiar territory quite well yesterday as i was going about my business in the university bookstore i noticed this stand with these daylight movie posters on it i had never heard of the movie so i stopped by to check it out it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering so i shrugged thought hey they probably won t give me the card anyway and i could always use a free movie so i signed up all in all i don t think i got that bad of a deal either rob cohen who has previously brought us such films as dragon the bruce lee story and more recently dragonheart gee i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason you think now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture with fx by industrial light and magic about the after effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey sylvester stallone plays kit latura who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in cliffhanger a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed when the crisis hits he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out there are other similarities to cliffhanger too perhaps the only real difference is that cliffhanger had a villain where daylight s bad guy is mother nature in fact had the two movies been made in hong kong this might have been titled cliffhanger ii it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film sequels do to their predecessors the first half hour of daylight is setup subplots are woven and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled we meet all the important people toxic waste disposal truck drivers a young frustrated jilted rejected playwright a family struggling to stay together an older couple and their dog a truckload of prisoners an ad agency executive a tunnel police officer stallone and others we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons and then thirty minutes into the film boom and it s a big one from there on in it s sly stallone to the rescue and rescue he does enduring batterings beatings falls repeated immersion in degree water explosions mud rats and constant setbacks before going on to save the day sly style again there s nothing new here and yet there doesn t need to be the fun of daylight is not in the story but in the execution the special effects are first rate thanks to industrial light and magic and the ensemble cast works well together once the film hits its stride it carries the viewer right along to the finish with very few jars along the way this review is copyright by christopher e meadows permission granted for distribution through rec arts movies reviews and all associated archival permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached all other rights reserved to the author 
quiz show an almost perfectly accurate true story is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid s twenty one on this trivial game show contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice on which they wagered an amount of points on the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win but after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants herbie stempel and charles van doren stempel john turturro a former g i and your jewish man raising a family stempel has been the reigning champion on twenty one for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars in his mind he is the best thing on television and the people love him although in the mind of the show s producers herbie stempel is getting old dan enright david paymer in particular feels that the people are tired of seeing a jewish guy from queens with bad teeth and that the kids need someone better to look up to therefore they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win someone who can defeat stempel even if they have to resort to cheating enter charles van doren ralph fiennes a well educated professor from a widely recognized family van doren had decided to try out for the game show tic tac dough because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing but when albert freedman hank azaria enright s assistant spots van doren the two decide that they have found their soon to be ruler of the twenty one kingdom van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer on purpose in order to lose the game after stempel loses the throne to van doren he starts to feel cheated which he should meanwhile on his own dick goodwin rob morrow a harvard law graduate has decided to start an investigation on twenty one to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved quiz show is an extremely well done movie and robert redford s direction is especially superb the performances turned in by john turturro ralph fiennes and rob morrow are very good although it seems that turturro stands out more than any quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film definitely a film you should not miss 
the film magnolia can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one magnolia is a clever well thought out film from prodigy director writer paul thomas anderson of boogie nights fame the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make magnolia memorable however what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories the film is never confusing anderson s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of magnolia s scenes drag on too long any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn t get boring it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees for example cop john c reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes races and genders suffer anderson s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get the performances in magnolia are perfection this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting anderson allows many of hollywood s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best character acting all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film worth noting is tom cruise who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon s character as phillip baker hall s wife she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film magnolia uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future 
for example in happy gilmore sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self confident jerk of a pro if the star were any other comic that would be enough motivation to drive the movie but with sandler the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house that extra motive doesn t make happy gilmore a funnier movie it doesn t really add any genuine emotional depth either in fact the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie but sandler s philosophy seems to be if it s a token gesture why not make it a nice gesture that is endlessly refreshing in the wedding singer sandler is right on track the fact that he s a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm he could make fun of the fat ugly or embarrassing people he meets at weddings and the story would be intact but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family robbie hart sandler doesn t just sing at weddings he also gets the loners to join in and have fun and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding the day comes when robbie has his own wedding and he is stood up by his heavy metal bride the movie is set in robbie takes it hard he doesn t sleep he doesn t eat and he gets punched out at work when he sings love stinks at a wedding julia drew barrymore who waitresses all the weddings in town gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to eventually robbie starts rebounding toward julia he really likes her but she s engaged her fianc is a self confident jerk do i see a trend nope just a formula who doesn t deserve her but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand julia seems to like robbie too but she can t leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc for the off chance that robbie might be serious about her you know the story you ve seen it a million times before there s always a new way to tell it with new lovers new chemistry and new details but it s the same story and sometimes it works the wedding singer works first of all the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective actually it s not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one s own romantic tension sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man struck with an unattainable love barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with sparks don t fly when they kiss but they both seem right for each other second their love is mature they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction they re a cute couple but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material instead they are both looking for someone meaningful someone to settle down with someone to grow old with at a wedding robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by the repulsing situation is taken in stride as if the two were already parents caring for their sick child the s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie other critics liked this movie in part because of the s soundtrack i liked it in spite of the soundtrack often the music and references felt forced for example robbie tells his ex fianc to get out of my van halen t shirt before you jinx the band and they break up ha ha ha get it david lee roth did leave van halen or how about when sammy allen covert robbie s chauffeur friend shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and get this a single silver glove that s exactly what mj used to wear all the time unfortunately making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding that s not to say the movie isn t funny screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before billy madison and happy gilmore and the two make a good combination herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight faced smart aleck style let s hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over with barrymore s charm and sandler s heart it was hard to go wrong 
when i saw the trailer for the sixth sense i didn t expect much from it my snap judgment was that it was a watered down version of the shining or possibly a late entry in the glut of angel related movies tv shows of a couple years ago but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe at the beginning of the movie he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work but he is soon confronted by vincent a patient malcolm failed years earlier donnie wahlberg former new kid in an impressive cameo a year passes and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed cole sear haley joel osment is a withdrawn kid who is called freak by the other boys in the neighborhood weird things seem to happen around cole his mother olivia williams leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn t moved and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn t for example that there was once a gallows in his school he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom the trailer gave away the movie s first major plot twist if it hadn t the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn t know what s wrong with cole if you re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer stop reading this review right now and go see the sixth sense anyway since the trailer gave it away i figure it s fair game to discuss here once malcolm gains cole s trust cole reveals his secret he sees ghosts everywhere dead people wander around not knowing that they re dead invisible to everyone except cole malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth the box office success of the sixth sense has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that s so i hate to burst anybody s bubble but the sixth sense isn t really a horror film at its core the sixth sense is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally scarred adult help each other to move past their problems some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy though one that really got to me the ghost of a boy says to cole i ll show you where my dad keeps his gun when the ghost turns we see the bullet wound in the back of his head osment gives the best performance i ve ever seen from a child actor it s hard enough to find a grown up in hollywood who can give a subtle realistic portrayal although willis gets top billing cole is really the protagonist of the story and osment truly brings the complex kid to life if only willis work were as impressive accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm his most challenging role to date this is a bad omen for his next movie the story of us which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage writer director m night shyamalan has a light poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite he s also a skillful storyteller as the movie s ending demonstrates only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole bottom line osment should get an oscar nomination and you should go see this movie 
the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and real movies consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste top flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks the movie represents a rethinking of the story s structure not merely a literal adaptation of the novel told in linear form by four narrators in the book egoyan s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator the author is even on record as applauding egoyan s changes in the press notes the book s author describes the story as a parable of lost children he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children picking up on this egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter nicole burnell played with grace by sarah polley reads parts of the pied piper from an old illustrated book to her two charges periodically throughout the picture nicole s readings are heard in voice over you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment they and the rest of the town s children come into harm s way some live and others are seriously injured and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss ian holm in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career plays mitchell stephens an intense man of quiet misery mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small snow encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness his mission there is a singular one to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone anyone on their behalf if this seems crass well it is but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot the story unfolds slowly and always believably each little aspect has its own fascination as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson he has a simple task he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit wendell ticks off one town member after another and then as one can in a small town enumerates each person s numerous faults although the town is no peyton place people there do have their foibles one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell bruce greenwood who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good bye to his kids well single parent billy s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story the accident itself a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice isn t shown until the middle of the picture but nevertheless the mystery about it builds throughout the film although the picture is no detective story finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy as the injured bus driver gabrielle rose dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning to round out the story mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear his daughter zoe caerthan banks is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half way house and recovery center after another fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk i can help you mitchell tries to reassure billy not unless you can raise the dead billy snaps back mitchell s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder mychael danna s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur but it is in the warm shadowy intimate moments indoors where it works best the show which is ripe for emotional manipulation never plays with its audience still when the house lights go up you may feel as i did i could barely breathe i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed more than anything the film is like a master painting each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint with the final color in place the masterpiece is complete and the ending credits roll the sweet hereafter runs it is rated r for mature themes sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers 
after the press screening of moulin rouge i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues everyone seemed a bit numb understandable after sitting through a barrage of often incongruous sounds and images a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production while a woman who flat out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye when one fellow quietly stated i ve never really been a fan of musicals the statement surprised me because even though the story is told almost completely through song i didn t think of it as a musical there is so much going on in moulin rouge that musical seems too small a term to cover it moulin rouge is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience australian director baz luhrmann the man behind strictly ballroom and romeo juliet fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork opulent imagery and songs ranging from the sound of music to smells like teen spirit sumptuous and beautiful vulgar and overdone moulin rogue travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with years worth of catchy tunes operates on the random setting oh and it has a story as well it was the summer of love christian ewan mcgregor is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris to write about truth beauty freedom and love where he encounters a group of bohemians led by henri de toulouse lautrec john leguizamo christian meets satine nicole kidman a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor at once fragile and vivacious the dazzling red haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler jim broadbent christian writes an opus modestly named spectacular spectacular zidler quickly finds a backer the wealthy duke of monroth richard roxburgh but there s a catch the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine as if all that isn t enough satine has a cough and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land like a teeter totter moulin rogue moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales together they dance while serenaded by the man in the moon alessandro safina provides the vocals apparently transported from the classic georges m li s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky other scenes merely traffic in everything and the kitchen sink overload the cavorting of toulouse lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy accompanied by cartoon sound effects is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like bewitched beat into the ground of course sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind we never heard from baz to turn it down one of the actors told the los angeles times it was always more more the director even sent a note to his cast reading i dare you to make me say you ve gone too far the musical numbers reflect his attitude one knockout piece the elephant love medley incorporates the beatles all you need is love u s in the name of love dolly parton s i will always love you and elton john and bernie taupin s your song need more how about diamonds are a girl s best friend spiced with portions of material girl luhrmann s cast offers a wide variety of approaches that together add up to something messy but often wonderful ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian emphasizing the sincerity of the love struck poet mcgregor s singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments once labeled the ice queen nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling yet tender performance she handles the songs adroitly although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler wait until you see him perform like a virgin as the buffoonish duke richard roxburgh proves to be the film s weakest link although i m sure he was simply following instructions i suspect moulin rogue will be one of those love it or hate it films while i didn t completely love it i most certainly liked it a lot over the course of a year i see well over movies and most of them look like xeroxes of each other moulin rogue is an original and an original even a flawed one is a thing to be cherished 
when i left the theater after seeing david lynch s lost highway i remarked to a fellow movie goer i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears in his first feature film in five years lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture eraserhead on the weirdness scale you won t know what happened when it s over though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses it is difficult to describe the plot of this film because it depends partly on how you interpret it i can however describe what we see on the screen l a jazz saxophonist fred madison bill pullman and his wife renee patricia arquette whom he clearly suspects of infidelity receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep they are naturally enough more than a little frightened and confused and it doesn t help matters any when mystery man robert blake approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving the next morning fred finds another videotape which to his and our surprise shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton balthazar getty the perplexed prison officials release dayton whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways most notably his affair with alice wakefield arquette again a blonde who is otherwise renee s spitting image and another encounter with the mystery man i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more but suffice it to say that lynch doesn t offer any neat wrap ups nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion the cinematic demons of lost highway are out in full force from beginning to end this description might make lost highway sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism but in fact while there are traces of lynch s weird sense of humor this film is anything but giddy most of the time on the contrary lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery rather the character is the mystery there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion distrust and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings on here we the audience are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this probably fred s in my opinion and what in that case the other characters and events are meant to represent all of this proceeds appropriately in lynch s typically slow paced idiosyncratic style as is often the case lynch relies on sound imagery and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story and in lost highway it works perfectly there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil s song to the siren can be heard faintly in the background nothing is technically happening in these scenes yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as if not more so than the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity lynch s direction and director of photography pete deming s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story well most of the time anyway i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer s attention because of its tie ins to the original mystery the main characters in this reality dayton a well meaning but none too intelligent year old a sleazy gangster who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character and his porn star girlfriend the blond arquette are nothing you couldn t find in any of the two dozen pulp fiction wannabes fortunately the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements such as the strained awkward conversations between pete and his parents help to preserve the film s spooky unnerving tone during this stretch lynch s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery are also somewhat overdone here it s not exactly exploitative like almost everything else in this film the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off that said these minor flaws don t prevent lost highway from attaining its place as one of the darkest most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years it is a one way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind and as such it is gripping intense and brilliantly effective 
i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding it contains parts of bringing up baby any hepburn tracy film part of the plot of war games cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday elevator shaft action train action and murder it is cute funny suspenseful a little bit sexy a little bit one of the bad guys was a surprise the pace is fast enough there are some action scenes i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together i really identified with the julia roberts character wishful thinking i know but i do have better hair her hair a very dull dark brown has no color she could use some highlights they both do fine with their roles he s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she s a hotshot cub reporter with the chicago globe they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie i like the one story focus other actors include charles martin smith as roberts boss olympia dukakis as nolte s coworker nora dunn also with the chronicle and marsha mason as a congresswoman basically this movie is reasonably fun there is a serious mystery to solve and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously i do give successful comedy high marks 
it was with great trepidation that i approached mary the farrelly brothers latest film i knew the film would be funny the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see but i also knew the film would be an equal opportunity offender attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon i figured the film would be raunchy maybe another lucky escapee from nc hell i may laugh but would i feel better in the morning i needn t have worried mary is the sweetest warmest all out laugh and grossfest this side of animal house surprisingly the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers they make laughter the toughest job for a filmmaker to do look easy the plot is typical thirteen years ago geeky ted ben stiller lucked out in having dazzling mary cameron diaz go with him to the senior prom as luck would have it on that very day he was hospitalized why i shall not tell but i assure you it isn t pretty he hires a private investigator to find her pat healy matt dillon he becomes one of the great comic villains upon finding her he too is lovestruck and so pursues her lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double crossed and goes to get her for himself would the geek get the girl puh lease the ending is pure hollywood no surprises there but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers hair gel the mentally disabled the physically handicapped interracial marriages homosexuals skin conditions serial killers tanning and drugged up dogs the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame and yet for all the targets that are hit the film maintains its sweet tone mary playing the straight role is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother warren w earl brown miles away from the cameraman in scream mary s sunniness carries the film here it compliments the below belt gags that come at you cameron diaz makes her totally charming and the audience respects her even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window ben stiller also fares very well totally changing his image from his reality bites and flirting with disaster straight men to being a how to say it a complete loser braces greasy long hair not too bright and very very funny dillon is exceptionally creepy especially with his capped teeth and rounding out the cast is ted s friend dom chris elliot tanning addict magda lin shaye modern troubador greek chorus ron lichman and mary s sweet mom markie post where has she been not everything works chris elliot s role skin blemishes and all becomes merely tasteless and boring there s lousy dialogue about eight minute vs seven minute exercise tapes and there are long stretches without much going on but the wait is worth it when those extraordinary sequences hit the entire theater erupted with howls tears belly aches that in some sequences carried over to the following scene the farrelly brothers have finally done it yes there are some raunchy bits but when it is all over it s not nearly as bad as it could have been while tasteless it didn t cross any lines at least not with me while raunchy it wasn t nearly as bad as porky s or boogie nights and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick after the funny but sour kingpin left a negative aftertaste in my palate comes the funniest sex farce since a fish called wanda approach this with an open mind and you will reap the benefits hugely 
in essence good will hunting is an ordinary story told well taken as a whole there s little that s special about this tale it follows a traditional narrative path leaves the audience with a warm fuzzy feeling and never really challenges or surprises us but it s intelligently written with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant strongly directed and nicely acted so while good will hunting is far from a late year masterpiece it s a worthwhile sample of entertainment like scent of a woman which was released around this time of the season five years ago good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world weary veteran and a cocky young man the formula for the two films is similar both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it but the characters are different al pacino s slade was a larger than life individual robin williams sean mcguire is much more subtle and matt damon s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o donnell s charlie will is a troubled individual as a child he was the frequent victim of abuse an orphan he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis now not yet years old he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box but he s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems while working as a janitor at mit he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building s hall blackboards then one evening his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau stellan skarsgard catches him at work will flees but lambeau tracks him down unfortunately by the time the professor finds him will is in jail for assaulting a police offer the judge agrees to release will under two conditions that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist eventually once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man sean mcguire a teacher at bunker hill community college agrees to take the case after a rocky start the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor and as will advances his self awareness in sessions with sean he also learns about friendship from his buddy chuckie ben affleck and love from a harvard co ed named skylar minnie driver the script by co stars matt damon and ben affleck is not a groundbreaking piece of literature and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation the characters are well developed however and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles at one point will comments that a session with sean is turning into a taster s choice moment later will gives a brilliant breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith note since smith co executive produced good will hunting it s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene director gus van sant drugstore cowboy to die for culls genuine emotion from his actors and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes there s an edginess to some of the sean will therapy sessions and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver who became romantically linked while making this film translates effectively to the movie the will skylar relationship is electric likewise the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie s friendship many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation even if the overall story is somewhat generic matt damon who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker is solid although not spectacular as will minnie driver last seen in grosse pointe blank adds another strong performance to a growing resume and it s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams whose sean is sad and wise funny and somber arguably the best dramatic work in the actor s career alongside what he did in the fisher king williams portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination adequate support is provided by ben affleck chasing amy and stellan skarsgard breaking the waves like most of what comes before it the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren t always bad things in a movie provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail good will hunting does both and as a result earns a rating commensurate with the good in the title 
metro i ve seen san francisco in movies many times there was s interview with the vampire and most recently the rock now yet again san francisco is the setting for this movie eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd he is their top hostage negotiator and the very best at what he does when his best friend on the force is killed by joe michael wincott in a terrific performance a psychotic demented jewel thief roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again meanwhile roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex girlfriend veronica while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who s an expert sniper and marksman michael rappaport despite the obligatory cop movie scenes does every cop new partner movie have to start the same way where the sgt assigns roper a partner roper confronts the sarge etc this film is still one heck of an explosive ride a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed and boasts some amazing car stunts eddie murphy shines in this tailor made role and for once his character shows depth and concern when confronting joe in prison you can feel the anger drip from every word michael rappaport is basically throwaway he serves no purpose except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day typical action escapist fare michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott s perfectly raspy voice i don t know what i do know though is that although metro is basically a typical action retread it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches the film is a triumph and an entertaining one at that it doesn t meander or trail off from its main character an enjoyable two hours metro is enjoyable witty action packed and fun and makes for a great action movie that s perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality 
 strange days chronicles the last two days of in los angeles as the locals gear up for the new millenium lenny nero ralph fiennes goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips he pines for his ex girlfriend faith juliette lewis not noticing that another friend mace angela bassett really cares for him this film features good performances impressive film making technique and breath taking crowd scenes director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it but as a whole this is an unsatisfying movie the problem is that the writers james cameron and jay cocks were too ambitious aiming for a film with social relevance thrills and drama not that ambitious film making should be discouraged just that when it fails to achieve its goals it fails badly and obviously the film just ends up preachy unexciting and uninvolving 
airplane is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film making after all it s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing directing teams even if most people don t recognize the names behind the films they are bound to recognize the titles airplane top secret the naked gun and hot shots to name a few but although the zucker abrahams zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in airplane remains the true cornerstone of their work and their directorial debuts in the seventies disaster films seemed to be at an all time high films like earthquake the towering inferno and the poseidon adventure were big hits there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane a series that spanned the entire decade and so in we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean it had to do with bad fish airplane is the story of ted striker robert hays an ex fighter pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six er seven comrades unable to stop living in the past ted s world fell apart he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job and eventually as we begin this film is getting dumped by his lover flight attendant elaine dickinson julie hagerty in a desperate attempt not to lose her ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working unfortunately she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her which leaves him wallowing in self pity in the midst of it all something happens someone gets sick then another then another soon the whole plane is full of deathly ill chicago bound people and when the pilots get sick played by peter graves kareem abdul jabbar and frank ashmore who will save the day gee i wonder of course the main draw here is the non stop whiz bang comedy with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags although i had seen this movie a few times before i was still laughing thru the entire thing the most fun character by far is the doctor played by leslie nielsen he s a dry subtle sterotypically straight faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film in a film like this you re not really expecting an elaborate production so one can t complain about the amateurish quality what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny played by stephen stucker this character is pointless nauseating and very unfunny i don t know why he was put in there and i don t think anybody will find a good excuse and when the film nears an end it slows down quite a bit almost getting old you gotta give it to a movie that only runs minutes and can feel two hours long aside from that airplane is really a top notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends especially if they haven t seen it and if they ask what the plot is just tell em it s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film but that s not important right now if you ve seen the film you ll understand 
capsule a rock and roll fable indeed like a hubert selby jr novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen and a ton of fun streets of fire bills itself as a rock and roll fable and the description is perfect this is a stylish great looking and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby jr novel with a damon runyan rewrite irected by bruce springsteen noir is one of the few truly american movie genres aside from the hollywood musical and the western this is post wwii brooklyn noir for lack of a better label with a generous injection of rock n roll and an all around confrontational attitude it all works the plot is simplicity itself rocker ellen aim diane lane is kidnapped by a vicious street gang led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven willem dafoe very nasty her old soldier flame played by michael pare comes back into town to save her but doesn t count on a whole bunch of things going askew that s about the entire plot save for the spats with ellen s manager a hilarious rick moranis an encounter with a doo wop group that winds up becoming ellen s supporting act and a whole gang of other fun little touches but in movies like this when is the plot important the movie is all style all visuals and attitudes quotable lines and posturing and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing no surprise that it was directed by walter hill hrs who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly and has put together a movie that s a mixture of times and sensibilities but perfectly unified in tone when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw and passes out every minutes on cue streets of fire isn t the greatest movie ever made but it occupies a totally unique little niche and enjoys the position it has anyone with a weakness for doo wop neon motorcycles rainy streets the el studebakers gang pictures lonely heroes and a great looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up i did 
 a bug s life may not be toy story but it s more close than antz was i really liked antz basically because yes it is clever and witty and intelligent and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead perhaps the year s most inspired casting but there was in fact something missing from it and i m the first to admit that maybe it s that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun it s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging and if it weren t for woody allen it would have been just a really clever good not great flick a bug s life has a similar premise and it also has disney to insure that it s g rated and not totally over kids heads like antz was not a bad thing believe me but what it also has is a tone that s completely innocent even when it s also remaining perpetually clever antz is still the more witty film and i love it for it and a bug s life is more for general consumption but it s also more entertaining it broadens its horizons and when it really moves from the ant colony it really shows us a whole new world we ve never seen before and it s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in antz it s also light and clever the visuals are instead of earth tones bright worldly colors and still gives the amazing visual technology of antz at least a worthy contender the characters are also nicely realized though watered down for broad consumption they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films the lead character flik voiced by dave foley is nothing more than a slightly less neurotic z from antz but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z instead of gene hackman playing the villain we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper the nicely titled hopper and for the romantic lead we don t get spacey sharon stone but intelligent and hard to get julia louis dreyfuss who doesn t even come around until the very final frames not that the plot s really any better than the one in antz it s basically yet another redux of the seven samurai with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else when flik a bone fide inventor creates a time conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season s donation he puts them all in risk and is sent away so that he won t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers he runs into a group of warrirors who are unbeknownst to him a group of carnival bugs and they agree to help under similar false pretenses these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in toy story foppish walking stick slim david hyde pierce german caterpillar heimlich joe ranft quick tempered and insecure male ladybug francis denis leary pretentious praying mantis manny jonathan harris his assistant butterfly hypsy madeliene kahn spider rosie bonnie hunt and two fleas tuck and roll michael mcshane who speak in undiscernable jibberish the writers lightly touch on each bug s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat whose usual mild mannered squeal is a scream of death the bug city is a modern day metropolis complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb holding out a cup with a sign lying next to him that says kid tore off wings and a rainstorm is like a giant flood with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour around this the pixar animators stage several large set pieces like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket meanwhile each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting something antz couldn t do and by the end over the end credits a bug s life pulls it s final punch out clever ing antz with a series of incessantly hilarious faux bloopers that come just at the right time when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money s worth of entertainment still it s no toy story that film maybe above any animated film i ve ever seen encompassed almost true perfection in story character and wit it proved that it didn t need to brag about it s cutting edge technology to really soar it s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far but is still the most satisfying and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun yet a bug s life as well as antz are still amazing films and prove without doubt that if you re gonna make a computer animated film send it to the guys who created these three flicks evne if they re not working under the same roof 
on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements in case you missed it warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail he says to a black congregation if you can t cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife you re never gonna get rid of me well there is such a plot and it works very well in this comedy beatty plays jay billington bulworth a long time democratic senator from california the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth s latest commercials condemning affirmative action the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv having gone without food or sleep for days his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe a million life insurance policy in his daughter s name then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination his assistant murphy oliver platt is oblivious to bulworth s suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african american church then takes questions from the audience he is hit hard with questions about his voting record he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots and it hasn t shown up since he s a dead man anyway he figures he ll answer truthfully he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l a for the photo opportunity they made some promises that improved their public image for a while and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made the shock and outrage from the congregation grows the questions keep coming and he keeps shooting back honest if ugly answers before i go further i d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make and that is that characterizing african americans as malt liquor drinking o j fans is not part of bulworth s truth that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics this line is not what they re talking about the experience is liberating with nothing left to lose bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth he can say whatever he wants because he s going to be dead anyway why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism bulworth s candor wins him three volunteers from the church one of whom nikki halle barry he gets a crush on he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something chicken wings appropriately enough bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment with so much money and so many talented people working so hard he wonders why can t hollywood make a quality product you go warren when they become indignant and ask why he s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product he callously admits that it s because they are rich jews that night he drops the three african american volunteers at their nightclub and he decides to go in with them he stays up all night drinking smoking pot dancing falling in love with nikki and learning to scratch turntables and rap the next day he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit and tie fundraisers from then on at all of his political appearances he raps his political truth his rap is not bad for a middle aged white guy he s not very good but it is his first try and at least he s not embarrassingly bad his lobbyists are not amused but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth eventually the movie s plot remember he hired a hit man overtakes the politics which is too bad screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes bulworth fleeing his killer these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along but it distracted and detracted from bulworth s political ranting which was much more interesting than the ever present obvious looking assassin still most of the movie is original and very enjoyable and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen as the story and screen writer he came up first with a good structure then with good dialogue to back it up jeremy pikser co wrote the screenplay as an actor he was able to convincingly portray bulworth s depression then liberation and rebirth as a producer there were four others he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood s indulgent formulas except for those inexcusable chase scenes someone else probably could have directed but since he was there anyway what the heck it s too bad that there aren t more movies like this around movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics after all much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants just don t expect to be popular with the insurance companies 
garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there shandling is chosen for the mission is given the name harold anderson and is set up as a banker in seattle after a few disastrous mating attempts he figures his best bet will be susan annette bening a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won t have sex again until she gets married the leader of harold s planet ben kingsley tells him to marry her and harold is soon exposed to all the joys of married life despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late s what planet are you from is a very funny movie the plot which the film wisely doesn t linger on the specifics of for too long is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes most of which work very well the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role and it s his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive plus if you think about it what planet are you from could have very easily gone the gross out route considering that shandling s character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited we never see anything though it s all implied which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness i m glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of less is more the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one s enjoyment of this film annette bening oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of high hopes for a lengthy period of time ben kingsley john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well and linda fiorentino good lord there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality what planet are you from is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of and enhanced for x televisions also included on the disc as extras a decent making of featurette an isolated score track talent files for the cast and crew and the film s original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for wolf men in black bugsy and as good as it gets when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track i actually laughed how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it s own isolated track well as it turns out it s a mighty fine score from carter burwell fargo the hudsucker proxy that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc what planet are your from was unjustly ignored in theaters and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it r 
steven spielberg s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film spielberg ever the student on film has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest and most powerful entries he also managed to cast this era s greatest answer to jimmy stewart tom hanks who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle for about out of its minutes saving private ryan is flawless literally the plot is simple enough after the epic d day invasion whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular capt john miller hanks and his team are forced to search for a pvt james ryan damon whose brothers have all died in battle once they find him they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home accompanying miller are his crew played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi davies and burns are the team sent to find one man and bring him home the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary literally there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film s first minutes spielberg films almost the entire movie without music leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion and they do to perfection the sequences in france all of them beginning with the battle and ending with the battle are fabulous especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides trying to save private ryan there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences this is what coppola was looking for in apocalypse now but couldn t create the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world with his comic timing dramatic flair his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears hanks is this country s finest actor and he proves it here however spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time spielberg creates minutes of purely worthless film the sequence involving army chief of stafff george marshall and mrs ryan is decent but doesn t hold up to the rest of the film relying on wartime cliches to power it but that is forgivable what isn t is the bookends of the film the cemetary sequences the first one is quite good a decent introduction into the lives of these men the last sequence is atrocious the forced emotion accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film these flaws are what downgrade ryan from the greatest film of our era to the greatest war film of our era spielberg should have trusted his own material and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie to end his masterpiece right there the use of the flag though patriotic is in contrast to the movie s theme the power of the bulk of the film however is astonishing spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art that persists even after first viewing of the film is extraordinary this is the film of the year 
clint eastwood in his ripe old age is cashing one talent in for another midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood directed film clint isn t even in and it s damn good adapted from a best selling john berendt novel based on true events this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head and that s just the mayor as director and producer eastwood contributes a self indulgent but very competent minutes neatly balancing drama suspense and humor like all great movies midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves and not from some contrived juvenile intrusion the acting from big time stars john cusack and kevin spacey is as good as you d expect but it s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm cusack plays a free lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey s parties lots of food beverages and gunplay yes an employee of spacey s has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead it seems like a simple matter of self defense the guy threatened spacey shot at him missed then spacey took him out but being a movie there s much more to it than that and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in the weird circle of entertainment this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in there s the requisite sexy woman alison nepotist s daughter eastwood the strange piano player the voodoo woman and the transvestite miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his her own as the stealer of every scene she appears in what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony chablis playing herself is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul but never seems exploited as the movie s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey s lawyer both help immensely as does having the fly guy as the jury s foreman it s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey s homosexuality yes spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man before he shot him of course midnight in the garden of good and evil isn t a classic but it is one of the better celebrity directed true story best seller adaptations out there likewise no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations but the performances are all great in fact i d almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category serving america for more than th of a century 
one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids although black and white films are frequently viewed as suspect ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind and if you can find a colorful action film even if it is from six decades ago then there is a real possibility of a take home hit so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood a high spirited version of the walter scott story nominated for the academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold s melodramatic music ralph dawson s fast paced editing and carl jules weyl s lush sets the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley a k a robin hood flynn with his handsome figure and toothy smile charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household the littlest rhodes jeffrey age liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more i ll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review simply stated the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre the swashbuckler robin with a smile from ear to ear fights off a hundred men without a scratch although the picture can be considered as little more than a s james bond the production values and the acting raise it above that level robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows in this movie however he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country robin with his courage and athletic skills serves as a role model for kids and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy eyed lady marian fitzswalter the story has heavy romantic overtones filmed in the typical richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players in scene after scene the picture charms the audience who wouldn t fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest even if the outcome is so clearly preordained and of course he doesn t just win he does so by splitting the other man s arrow watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments sherlock holmes as the villain sir guy of gisbourne for example just doesn t seem right even if basil rathbone did have a real life identity outside of his most famous role and then there are those wigs from the makeup department so bad they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy as was popular in the cinema of that era people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks bad guys are banished rather than killed and lovers go off hand in hand doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful cartoonish figures hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore so try to savor the old ones when you can the adventures of robin hood runs it is not rated but containing absolutely nothing offensive it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages jeffrey thinks the film is great and gives it he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures he hates the sight of blood in movies his favorite parts are the battles and the ending and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ian hunter

to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie mulan is a whole new world the mouse factory s latest feature is a treasure featuring magnificent animation a strong story and finely drawn characters mulan is the story of a fiesty head strong young woman who unlike other disney heroines isn t seeking her prince charming mulan s motivations are simple to save her father serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation the emperor has called for a conscription one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation mulan s crippled father is called but mulan sneaks off steals his armor and takes his place mulan is a saga of courage and self discovery yet despite the grim backdrop of war it is a lively tale of self reliance and brain over brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian american talent as the voices for the main characters including the wonderful ming na wen the joy luck club as mulan b d wong as shang mulan s commanding officer and later love interest pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon tek oh as mulan s proud but loving father also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon sent by mulan s ancestors to watch over and help the young woman his fast wise cracking hip talking mushu may seem out of place but it s a crowd pleasing performance especially for the youngsters the movie features only a couple of songs fewer than most previous disney animated flicks but mulan s are winners the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus mulan is a treat more powerful than hercules with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame at about minutes mulan moves rapidly and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain also it is hoped that the success of mulan and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them committed to lifelong learning through effective communication 
okay let me first say this is a beavis and butthead movie if you do not like beavis and butthead do not go to see this movie however if you do like them i recommened you get out right now and go see it the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it this wind their way through america searching for dallas she is a woman they look for her because as they are searching for the tv they find a drunk who wants them to do his wife well of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her and the fun starts their this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag he manages to keep the laughs coming if you expecting changes from the show keep looking the same character the same voices the same everything from the show and that s what makes it good you might think with a movie from a tv show you can change a few things often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place 
elmore leonard has quickly become one of hollywood s favorite authors out of four film adaptations in as many years the witty and inventive out of sight gives get shorty a run for its money as the best leonard adaptation around george clooney stars as jack foley a nice bank robber you know the type he uses his charm and his wits rather than a gun but even charming guys end up unlucky and jack ends up in jail but not for long he plots an escape with the help of his best friend and fellow robber buddy bragg ving rhames and their slow witted pothead associate glenn michaels steve zahn but jack didn t count on u s marshal karen sisco jennifer lopez appearing at the right place at the wrong time karen gets involved in foley s escape attempt and the subsequent manhunt to bring him in however karen develops a rapport with jack foley and finds that she begrudgingly likes the guy but can love prosper on opposite sides of the law or can karen straighten out jack before he goes too far in pursuit of just one last crime clooney who has had a string of solid but never stellar film roles delivers his best performance to date he blends into his role here perfectly as the risk taking jack foley who s willing to gamble everything on the chance that karen sisco might be his true love jennifer lopez does an excellent job as well she actually has a trickier role than clooney as a woman who has to balance her emotions with her sense of duty she and clooney develop good chemistry together the film boasts a superb ensemble steve zahn gives a hilarious performance and steals nearly every scene he s in don cheadle is appropriately sinister as a violent ex con who may or may not be teaming up with foley albert brooks is enjoyable as a white collar criminal who talks too much for his own good out of the cast only dennis farina seems underused as karen s ex lawman father steven soderbergh gives the film sharp and stylistic direction with an affectation for freeze frames he delivers a unique take on the film s action and love scenes that places out of sight a notch above routine crime films a recurring series of flashbacks makes the film seem more complex than it actually is devoid of its bells and whistles out of sight is actually a fairly straightforward crime story however there are only a few spots in the film that seem bare and they pass quickly with smart dialogue good characters and an excellent cast out of sight easily smoothes over the rough spots in the plot and delivers on both the action and romantic fronts 
after the average mouse hunt the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz dreamworks try again with the children s film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story as the film warns us at the beginning it s not the full story and some liberties have been taken but generally this the bible story we all know and love featuring burning bushes the plagues and the parting of the red sea the only thing missing is charlton heston instead we get val kilmer voicing moses an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt helen mirren we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses fiennes all grown up moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron sandra bullock and jeff goldblum that he isn t really the son of the pharaoh seti patrick stewart and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule he soon sets about this along with his wife tzipporah michelle pfeiffer rameses and his two wizard friends voiced by steve martin and martin short try to stop moses completing his task while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults for children reared on aladdin and hercules this film could be the most godawful thing they ve ever seen gone is the quick fire humour and standard easy to follow plot but spectacularly and to dreamworks credit nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen jeffrey katzenberg who produced this film certainly knows how to keep a child interested he s included some songs in the film plus some comedy and a exciting chariot chase to keep the children interested and somehow himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across without ever being boring it s a remarkable achievement also remarkable is the animation which puts hercules an almost slap dash effort to shame relying on hand drawn and computer animation the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed the film seems a little caught up with it s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and moving shots but they do look incredible the final plague where god kills every first born child and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed kudos to the animators the vocal talent is also very good val kilmer does a fine job as moses although he doesn t sing and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses and he does sing sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great and steve martin and martin short are very good but not in the film long enough finally michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife kudos also goes to the voice of god who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued sadly he is uncredited and i couldn t quite work out who the voice was but e mail if you do the songs are good ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number they don t disturb the movie and while not particularly memorable they are nice to listen to they re well sung aswell the musical score is suitably epic with some beautiful tunes coupled with the superb visuals the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat backed up with a great story entertaining both for kids and adults this film is a must see a david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes 
in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer professor with such lived in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance ever since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid s in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world you d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good natured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open in wonder boys his performance isn t showy or a tour de force it s simple yet truthful he embodies grady a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms grady points out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy their target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges he s portentous and gloomy as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers though his act is a little too calculated he reminds me of the self imposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and with his spiked hair dyed snow white leer is similar a guy who equates quirks with depth tobey maguire fits well in the role with his round sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude but unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to he s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility katie holmes plays hannah a beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in grady s pants this is a plot line i had trouble with douglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady maybe it s because i m jealous and wish holmes was throwing herself at me after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth then i think of douglas s real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and i m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas there is a movie in there somewhere grady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell a droll frances mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor okay maybe not so chivalrous there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says she was a junkie for the printed word lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice robert downy j r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual he s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance the actor is perfectly cast here and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor i wish wonder boys had more of him searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless for it meanders through its running time but that s part of its charm and maybe i m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia a place i m greatly fond of and a place rarely explored in american cinema everyone has a sub genre be it war films westerns dance movies that they happen to be privy to i m privy to films about literary types i e those individuals enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters rather than generic mapped out story points sometimes the dialogue is too clever but that s a problem i wish i found with films more often another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted like its characters but as the story progresses it begins to open up for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types and as a low key comedy for its chuckle worthy throwaway gags the gags are like those in the great robert altman m a s h the long goodbye movies where jokes exist as asides on the fringes like jokes in life often do the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isn t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things curtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rocks the cradle has graduated to more meaningful films he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in a wonder boys party it fits the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen it s the cinematic equivalent to a good read novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies many will find it slight but i found much to savor among its subtleties 
waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury joe says after all we re human in the context of events to transpire joe s line is prophetic foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film does being human necessarily imply humane behavior through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria in the scene prefacing the lynching the mob achieves critical mass at the bar deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant but when he is unable to augment the mob s myth of joe he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless to the audience the deputy s quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob s delirium crescendos lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera but rather its stillness the shot s composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers it does so around the viewer as well the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality because the camera does not track the deputy s movement we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability as the bar scene progresses the camera pans degrees to reveal the fury of the mob this shot is unique because it is a point of view shot where the audience not a character in the film is the subject while a long or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob panning from the mob s belly distorts the audience s spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large we see close shots of people s faces contorted by their rage with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob lang s camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail in some greater sense it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind lang s observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior as joe faces his peril trapped in his burning cell his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality lang depicts man s volatility and impulse towards inconceivable cruelty reprising joe s line at the train station we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity 
 we run tings tings don t run we sound advice from capone paul campbell to his squaddie or partner floyd winston bell jamaican film shot entirely on video featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo styled brotherhood morals and a little gunplay capone a tough as nails super cop gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home while he was with his lady and killed his partner in front of him when he arrives he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and much to his disappointment also finds out his childhood friend ratty mark danvers has been helping him torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films although the action isn t as hyperkinetic as most of woo s films are the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though and eventually begin to take on a life of their own beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after the make up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well with flawless squib work on display from the effects team the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue spoken with thick jamaican accents half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang just adds to the interest paul campbell as the loose cannon capone essays his role perfectly displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty the part time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together unfortunately carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective largely because his underlings seem to run all over him but then again that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists sly and robbie who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones maxi priest bob dylan james brown grace jones herbie hancock bootsy collins and carly simon among others the end credit song we run tings by the group red dragon is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review oddly enough desmond ballentine who plays the character deportee is well known as a pioneer in the realm of gangsta reggae as the performer ninjaman and he doesn t contribute a single song to the film that i could see which is virtually unheard of here in the us at the time of this writing third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us coming off of a six month box office breaking run in jamaica where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time bringing in million in jamaica which is roughly us palm pictures the company that released the offbeat but entertaining six string samurai is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters chris blackwell founder of palm pictures was also involved in the production of another jamaican box office smash in entitled countryman so i d say he has a pretty good track record overall third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo ringo lam tsui hark and many other action films by directors from hong kong if action films are your thing and you don t mind intermittent subtitles then you can t go wrong with this film the performances and the story are solid if only a little cliched and the action is tight i m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like but apparently third world cop s honors are well deserved 
plot a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn t quite know what she wants out of life one day she falls upon something and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others she starts with the people around her but when she suddenly falls for her own guy she can t act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature critique a clever quirky original french flick set in a picturesque paris featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone this is a feel good kind of movie a fairy tale for grown ups who are bummed out about life it doesn t pretend to be deep it doesn t weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters it s basically just a cute movie in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year a sham on so many different levels you might as well slap this film up for consideration also since it s quite a bit better and much more original than the former one thing that this film isn t though at least according to me is the best film of the year it was bestowed the honor of best in at least different film festivals so far this year it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long it s a little over two hours but it felt even longer with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters all of whom weren t as interesting as the lead and a lot of indecisiveness from ms amelie herself which got frustrating thankfully this film doesn t bog itself down with too much of that stuff and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind hearted french girl on the whole it s a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man the lead audrey tautou is perfect for the role and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film unfortunately the rest of the cast isn t as well developed and even though most of them are pretty appealing a couple could ve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot wise by the film s end what happened to the guy in the caf who was spying on his ex girlfriend the whole movie now i haven t seen too many recent french films i will admit but if this is the kind of scene that they re developing over in le pays du vin i wouldn t mind catching more of their flicks in the future crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year which i really liked ironically that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz who is the co star in this film granted the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times i speak and understand french also but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head especially since the film s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn t help but constantly gawk at them but the general idea the background music the nifty french neighborhoods the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story line from the start were all very easy to appreciate and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world in fact i d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol time at the movie house with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts and this guy directed alien resurrection get outta here note i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film it was very original very well shot and very nostalgic as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described good stuff where s joblo coming from chocolat crimson rivers ghost world like water for chocolate o brother where art thou pay it forward rushmore woman on top 
casting doogie howser star neil patrick harris as mind reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of starship troopers a hugely entertaining mega budgeted sci fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven who s making quite a recovery from his g string epic showgirls sure starship troopers qualifies as cinematic junk food but that s forgivable when the junk food is this tasty everyone needs a high calorie change of pace from fall s onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait and troopers does the job admirably despite its flaws for its first hour starship troopers plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of saved by the bell and g i jane in the distant years ahead high school grad johnny rico casper van dien signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen denise richards he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot so the couple is broken up but there s temptation awaiting both of them johnny s is in the form of an old friend dina meyer also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor patrick muldoon personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final minutes when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america killing johnny s parents and destroying his home our weakening lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens home planet where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good but the enemy is far smarter more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for and after an initial walloping they must re examine their strategy the exposition played like a futuristic soap opera is silly but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous but never boring training sessions starship troopers really kicks into high gear its last half is all gruesomely violent action a fury of severed limbs decapitations disembowelments brain removal explosions and other jolt inducers that are really going to please the and year old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r rated show the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic imaginative high point it s nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren t too derivative of the titular menace from alien these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights especially the arachnids a spider scorpion crab combo that s all sharp talons and even sharper legs they attack in packs of hundreds and it s a funny scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined gooey mess it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot these sequences of insect warfare are numerous bloody and immensely satisfying the occasional dramatic moments one cast member s death the final resolution to johnny s love triangle are botched a testament to how starship troopers fails to create any strong outstanding characters these bland ken and barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm s length but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la star wars where even the slightest aliens had definite personality the acting is decent but never spectacular most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory smallish roles on beverly hills and or melrose place and it occasionally shows van dien for example is limited but perfectly likeable in smaller parts are the afore mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny s best friend and jake busey gary s son as johnny s sidekick the latter excels at playing creeps see the frighteners or contact but seems off kilter as a second banana starship troopers is based on the novel by robert heinlein a sci fi writer who hasn t exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with s howler the puppet masters but the overall familiarity to the alien trilogy and the promise of great gobs of gore could act as a crowd drawer its own possible influence however might well work against it when the franchise continuation alien resurrection opens in a few weeks we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall 
on the basis of this film alone i never would have predicted that in two years quentin tarantino would become the country s biggest hotshot director reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction but is a much less substantive more conventional crime story than the big pf here s what the two movies do have in common scenes of intelligent amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical chronological sequence graphic yet necessary violence an engaging crime story dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial gender slurs three of the same actors harvey keitel tim roth and steve buscemi a mexican standoff ending although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it s only got one story to tell rather than three crime lord joe cabot veteran actor lawrence tierney has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated instead they are all given code names off the color chart mr white keitel mr pink buscemi mr orange roth mr blonde michael madsen mr brown tarantino and mr peach tarantino s chin most of the movie s running time is spent with mr white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive mr orange meanwhile is on the floor dying from a gunshot wound the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon leading white to believe one of the five was an informant the story s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime eventually blonde arrives with a police officer hostage and what follows is a truly brutal uncomfortable torture scene let s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop s ear a lot of the time reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist gone wrong movie but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn t live up to as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on among other things tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna s like a virgin another scene involves roth s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie reservoir dogs is good but it s no pulp fiction 
no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan i m referring specifically to the narrative form in the sweet hereafter egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster said story of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent british columbia that shatters the morale of the locals is told in a most unstraightforward manner when the film opens the accident has already happened and stephens the wonderful holm a polite ambulance chaser has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning throughout we get to meet the parents of the dead broken souls who follow stephens like the pied piper passages of which are read during the film but there is one living passenger the paralyzed nicole polley whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify we finally do see the accident about three quarters into the film which is a stunning visual effect a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding then stopping then collapsing into a frozen lake is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and perhaps ever in a motion picture the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane traveling to meet his hiv positive runaway daughter as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre accident i have a problem not with the story or story structure but with egoyan s heavy handedness behind the camera for the first hour or so i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears these are miserable miserable people but that s just the problem so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while when a lot of sadness becomes too much also a subplot involving incest rings untrue perhaps it wouldn t feel so contrived if it weren t shot in such a tasteful manner there are two characters who are father and daughter when they first appeared i thought they were lovers i was half right nevertheless it s worth seeing the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that american films are about action canadian films are about consequences hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors including crash and kissed the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films simply because it s not boring or in the case of kissed afraid of its own material necrophilia egoyan is a fine fine postmodern storyteller whose work is entertaining edgy and smart if a bit too intellectual at times though i harped on the weightiness of the material i was always absorbed engrossed and surprised by the sweet hereafter 
the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid s point of view is in a word dark you wouldn t expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson s novel but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal jekyll hyde john malkovich is terminally depressed and desperate mary reilly julia roberts is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti woman sentiment of the times director stephen fears version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie it almost appears to be filmed in black and white the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry except there s no red of course the look is so moody and melodramatic that you ll be shocked when you leave the theater i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good but certainly powerless his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience two parts that make up a whole neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated disaster is inevitable the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude when we finally see the transformation the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction not the psychological horror that the tale demands roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles both are suitably melancholy fitting in with the rest of the film the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close and her lips as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives and surprisingly jekyll apparently frequents life and color maybe but this is not close s best role she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character a beautiful film in its own dreary way you ll appreciate the filmmaking craft but don t expect to leave in an upbeat mood 
it s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year but that is what disney and pixar animation s latest film represents while a bugs life isn t nearly as deep as it s predecessor dreamwork s antz it is just as funny a bug s life centers appropriately around the life of an ant named flik flik cutely voiced by newsradio s david foley hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission they never dream he will be successful they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food flik s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs who he mistakenly assumes are warriors when he returns with the warriors the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes a bug s life has animation that is simply stunning the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative together with the great voice acting this film is the perfect holiday family film its main weakness is that it couldn t beat antz to the theaters making it seem like stale material 
the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane billy played by michael keaton is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble christopher lloyd portrays henry an obsessive compulsive who requires that everything be neat orderly on schedule and by the books he thinks he s a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports jack played by peter boyle thinks he s jesus and finally there s stephen furst as albert a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four some when their psychiatrist dr weitzman takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium during a pit stop they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan the movie s charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively they never miss an opportunity to argue bicker or insult one another henry and jack for example fight over who s going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other michael keaton is well cast as billy he gives his cynical character considerable complexity as the divinely jack peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one dimensional character funny and fresh although stephen furst s catatonic character is cliched the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing while keaton boyle and furst are good it s christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance his body language for example the way he walks and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character lloyd s brilliant performance yields a pathetic moving and memorable character the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot 
well i ll admit when i first heard about this film which was before dante s peak i could just smell what twister had started so now it seems that we re in a full fledged return to the s disaster film era with twister dante s peak volcano and soon flood and james cameron s extremly expensive titanic i ll say first off i enjoyed volcano much more than i did dantes peak part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in i ve been reading a lot about the movie being cheezy or hokey and really didn t see or think that once during the entire film i get bored easily and this film didn t bore me for a minute another thing and boy am i bitching today that bothers me is when critics and such go on about well thats not really possible you know what i couldn t give a bloody damn if it s possible or not really i couldn t it s a freaking movie and i don t want reality thrown in my face i want to be able to see the impossible the all might what if to many reviewers have seen one to many movies the special effects are the second star to this feature they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground they did an incredible job and come oscar time if they remember some notice better be thrown there way 
disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure mulan while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults fa mulan ming na wen singing lea salonga wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family it s just that she doesn t quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker miriam margoyles mulan would prefer speaking her mind but there is trouble on the horizon the evil huns led by shan yu miguel ferrer are invading china the emperor pat morita has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army the only male in mulan s family is her father fa zhou soon tek oh who old and with a bad leg honorably accepts his fate mulan on the other hand decides to save her father s life by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield mulan under the assumed name of ping appears at camp where she along with the other bumbling recruits yao harvey fierstein chien po jerry tondo and ling gedde watanabe are trained in the art of war by captain shang b d wong singing donny osmond but she s not alone in her tasks in typical disney fashion she has three animal companions her horse khan a lucky cricket crickey and a pint sized guardian dragon called mushu eddie murphy much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn t flow well with the rest of the more serious story sure some occasional comic relief is welcome particularly in a film geared for the younger set but mulan overdoes it the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good but schizophrenic experience but that commentary aside this is a very well made film which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable the animation is on par with some of disney s best the story itself is interesting and the action scenes are awe inspiring the musical score to the film is enjoyable though as has been the case with disney s recent work the songs are mostly forgettable at least we re only subjected to four of them this time around mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date most of the killing is off screen and it s all highly depersonalized there s nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi s mom there s nothing graphic and the film resides snugly inside a g rating children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies it s ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor ax the compulsory songs and remove the obligatory and somewhat unrealistic romance they could have had a classic on their hands instead they merely deliver a very good time at the movies 
it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less than savoury character as mel gibson does in payback of course if i was being paid million for one month s work i d probably be willing to take risks as well but that s neither here nor there payback is based on a novel by richard stark apparently actually donald e westlake author of the grifters itself a fine crime film which was also filmed in the s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys lee marvin the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back by whom we don t know yet all we know is that gibson as porter isn t a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back and getting even in the process no matter what the consequences it turns out that the man he s after is val gregg henry his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers porter however is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet goes about exacting revenge on the double crossing val gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn t mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants you probably wouldn t see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat out of character role such as porter jim carrey won t be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried the cable guy anyone harrison ford s idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin which we won t mention further and has stallone ever really played a villain at all this is not to say that porter is a villain per se while he isn t the sort of character you wouldn t want to get on the wrong side of he s nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right hand men just to prove how mean they are porter is only trying to get back what is not so rightfully his which in a way is almost understandable payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy thriller which won t be remembered as being among gibson s most important work but is still one of the finer films he s done the only real problem with it is that while everything seems to work out in the end i was left feeling something was lacking was that all the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute and the final voice over doesn t ring true even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film noir style the rest of the film embodies the film just ends far too suddenly after a huge build up in the penultimate scenes a fine film even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending 
this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff s play hospitality suite its about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention whose chicago company has sent them to wichita where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the th floor of the hotel where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of a big industrial corporation he is someone they have never met before but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account it is their only reason for coming to the convention the big kahuna revels in salesmen talk among the three white christian males two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesmen having teamed together for the last twelve years while bob facinelli is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what comes into question is their opinions on life and death on god and morality and on how they make a living these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical following in the long tradition of salesmen films from death of a salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying to see why he s on top and why they are chasing after him what makes this film different than the others is its blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do as both must sell their product and how after each one s psyche is stripped clean by the other there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in bob is a baptist who takes a very non questioning and literal attitude about religion to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin according to the way he reads the bible when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and can t even say because he loves her only that marriage is something sacred to him the contrast in their personalities is stark larry is all business he simply wants to close the sale he comes into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such a small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burned out he tells him to go on a vacation get a woman while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change now that he is and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in he has always been a charmer shaking everyone s hand trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale larry is more aggressive as a salesman he is always a heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller doesn t arrive at the party the salesmen throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act as the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend larry and phil can t fathom how bob didn t make a sales pitch but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller s attention about their company s product as they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives these three performers were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with a marvelous performance the only problem with the film is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see 
logical time travel movies are a near impossibility considering that the skeptic s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task occasionally we get a film that does manage it terry gilliam s monkeys was one such film but more frequently we get films that don t much deal with it at all there is one question to ask in this case does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies the terminator films made up for them with exciting action back to the future did it with an entertaining story and the new film frequency pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own is frequency filled with plot holes yes does it matter not really the film opens in october of firefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job then goes home to his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson the double pronged story flashes forward to where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working as a police detective a strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in and that john has found in the present day though both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women frank and john now must work together to set things right with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past the premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions this isn t explained you just have to go with it when frank doesn t die in a fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities and are to each other sometimes frank s changing the past results in something happening right away in john s world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time now the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if i thought about it hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer s murders was because the change had already happened in frank s world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanations aren t really the point when frequency gets cooking it s a riveting little thriller even if it is confusing what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment and frequency works as long as it keeps moving the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency as good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care for them and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved i liked many of the creative touches the split screens allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward it actually uses the mets orioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets to great effect frank uses john s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him admittedly this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself i even liked the final scene which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods some may find this scene blindingly confusing as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but it does make sense if you think about it and give the script a lot of leeway and let s face it it s a darn cool way to end the film there are enough surprises and plot twists in frequency to keep you on your toes and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant the other major thing to appreciate about frequency is the handling of the father son relationship quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily it s a rock solid job from both actors the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative or with a future descendant watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film if we don t believe in the characters we don t care about the outcome of the thriller plot here we do care because we like the lead actors i also liked some of the supporting cast members elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably andre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street gives a nice supporting turn as frank s best friend and future colleague of john he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank s world series predictions come true before his very eyes braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused perhaps the only thing i didn t like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during which the camera s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard but that s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics i freely acknowledge that frequency may best work as a guy movie since it focuses on the very male oriented idea of father son relationships echoes of field of dreams can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable who wouldn t want to speak with a long dead parent or see how their children turn out tell me about your life son excuse me while i mist up and don t call me a sissy 
i must admit i m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre but something drew me to this film maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role and the hilarious eugene levy maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity con air and pushing tin but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life the story of serendipity is simple two people john trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale looking ever so hot have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves with buck henry smack dab in the middle charmed beyond repair these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf called serendipity talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink but with each of them already involved with other parties sara has john write his name and number on a bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera sara declares that if this thing let s just call it love is destined to happen fate will bring them together in the future years later and on opposite coasts of america john and sara both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat and mouse game with the fates involving such items as mistaken identity a graduate homage john corbett as a freaky new age musician and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman to find out if that thing was right after all fortunately first time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong well rounded characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones and the use of time lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters on the flipside films such as you ve got mail made in heaven and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film s main journey at hand but it s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture

buffalo is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci gallo plays a very troubled man who was sent to jail for gambling once out of jail he must visit his parents who he told he was married the truth is he isn t married to try to impress them he kidnaps a girl christina ricci from a tap dancing class to act as his wife the film is very cheaply made and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie but you don t need money to make a good film buffalo doesn t always stay with the realistic concept and sometimes goes through outrageous events gallo s parents played by angelica huston and ben gazarra are two very strange individuals the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits gallo and ricci arrive at his parent s house and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house ricci s performance during the scene at gallo s parent s home are very well done there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative they seemed very mediocre but they worked out just fine gallo s character is developed very well the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through his character goes through many many problems just like many people in real life this character seemed very realistic to me ricci s character is funny and different she doesn t care much that she has been kidnaped in fact she falls in love the man who kidnaped her ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves buffalo isn t all laughs though many scenes are very dramatic and depressing gallo s character was so realistic he was extremely disturbing some scenes are supposed to come off as funny but they actually seemed sad and real to life the film sometimes drags along not giving much material i really would have liked to see gallo s parents a lot more and i would have liked to see the characters developed more overall buffalo isn t as good as some people put it up to be the bottom line a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom

no i did not read the novel by thomas hardy jude the obscure his final novel final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again see i did do some research on it about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life but after watching the movie i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is jude is a satirical film from start to finish about society s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system but what s remarkable is how timeless this film is the film takes place in the late th century or early th wasn t really sure but its story could even be retold today in modern form although it d be kinda different a given it tells the story of jude christopher eccleston the psychotic accountant from shallow grave a simple dim witted young man with big dreams in its bleak foreboding opening shot in grainy black and white he gets a lesson from phillotson liam cunningham his teacher as they stand upon a mountain looking upon a city in the distance he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella rachel griffiths because they frolicked in the hay literally but did not ultimately share anything in common he moves away to a town with a giant university with a chance to learn more and get ahead in life taking a welding job he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars reciting latin over and over again and training himself but when he sends his application for the school in he is bluntly told to just remain a worker another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there sue kate winslet his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job for none other than phillotson at the local school there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business nudge nudge several twists turn in the storyline and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business an interesting scene to say the least and are soon born into a controversial non wedlock as she eventually gives birth to their baby and jude inherits his son from arabella who turns up again after awhile because they aren t married and because they re cousins they run into problems with every place they go to carrying around two children everywhere and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time then moving on if you didn t think this was harsh enough wait till you see what happens later on the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world he will never gain any true happiness and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life part of it is his fault he s too optimistic and too gullible but society has a way of taking these people and hurting them until their death the ending of jude is bleak because it has to be although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse guess i ll have to read it now jude offers a satirical view on society s cruelties but shows no way of curing this and thank heavens it doesn t there s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people s minds and that s what jude is sure it s one hell of a downer but it needs to be the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads and some good supporting work along with it christopher eccleston slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression plays jude wonderfully sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face and making him kind of child like at other times kate winslet in a pre titanic performance is brilliant nailing every psyche of her character and creating someone who s troubled but very seductive with her personality kate may be the best actress in her age group if you don t believe me see titanic branagh s hamlet sense and sensibility and heavenly creatures the latter one being my favorite performance of hers in the supporting roles liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher exposing all his bad parts but ultimately being a pretty good person and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude s wife whom he never divorces jude moves at a very slow pace and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists which would drive some people nuts but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films no matter how slow or downright depressing they are this one is both will appreciate jude though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it 
bob the happy bastard s quickie review the matrix what s worse than y k how about a fully digital future where nothing is real that s what computer programmer neo keanu reeves slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix a movie directed by the wachowski brothers the guys behind the hip thriller bound before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role hold on there s actually a story with depth here it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss who looks quite cool in leather i must say neo reeves is pretty much a key player in this fight although he really doesn t look it at first could this amateur be the one as fisburne thinks he is credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build something that few special effects laden films seem to do these days there s plenty of effects to go around of course but at least there s a backbone to build them on as well reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy yet great i wish the villains weren t quite so generic leftover g men from looking for a sweet sci fi actioner with plenty of stop motion swooping camera angles and of course a motherlode of a helicopter explosion now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project bring it on 
the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire fu copycats it s not a pretty death and it s leaving the likes of schwartznager stallone and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea sometimes the mix results in a mind blowing spectacle unlike any other quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work as in s the matrix can be a real gem but too often hollywood gets it wrong even when they pay off chinese directors flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists mostly it s laughable in hollywood s rush to emulate the success of the matrix trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form but iron monkey the latest asian import shows us how to get it right iron monkey actually a reissue of a film is the story of a th chinese vigilante rongguang yu fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei hong most recently seen in one of the most overlooked and possibly best films of drunken master released in the u s as the legend of drunken master unlike drunken master which stars jackie chan as an adult fei hong iron monkey finds a much younger fei hong sze man tsang and his father wong kei ying yen chi dan thrust into the middle of iron monkey s fight against oppression iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master at times fighting styles especially that of monkey himself do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle toed floating of films like crouching tiger hidden dragon director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger however there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good hearted but misguided enemy chief fox in those moments and in others iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune aka siunin wong fei hung tsi titmalau 
a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings a prime example of this is s things i hate about you which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school less successful was last year s adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp here the setting was the corporate world of new york now comes o a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare s tragedies like things i hate about you the stage is a high school a private prep school where odin james mekhi phifer is the on court general the basketball team s standout player julia stiles featured in things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke s hamlet plays desi brable odin s girlfriend whose father also happens to be dean of the institution josh hartnett pearl harbor is on hand for the villainy playing the scheming hugo who sets the tragic wheels in motion o was actually filmed a couple of years ago but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy the movie directed by tim blake nelson best known for his co starring role in o brother where art thou and written by brad kaaya is very grim an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits and that is how it should be of all of shakespeare s tragedies othello is the most harrowing not because of any body count but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery kaaya s profane filled script after all these are high school kids does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts the young man considers himself the basketball team s prime utility man who does a little bit of everything pass shoot rebound but is constantly in the shadow of odin plus his father the team s coach played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood the script follows the familiar lines of the classic hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi s fidelity eroding the star s confidence in those he considers closest to him affecting both his relationships and his game it all ends in blood of course which is why the movie was originally shelved the performances in o vary phifer is at first cocky and self assured emotions he handles with ease he also does quite well displaying odin s darker side his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution his growing distrust of those he loved his rage and the erosion of his belief system hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit turning friend against friend and lover against lover stiles seems a bit stilted but occasionally also rises to the occasion moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight the film does contain a few missteps a subplot involving hugo s theft of the school mascot is left hanging also desi s actions concerning michael andrew keegan odin s former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo s machinations is puzzling why she would continually be seen with michael however innocent the circumstances when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back it is irrational but these are minor carpings overall o is a stylish and faithful adaptation if nothing else it may encourage some people to read the original text and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature 
a costume drama set in the s england elizabeth is a lush romantic political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens the royal family so to speak are upset that a protestant should be crowened and not another catholic plus the new queen elizabeth i cate blanchette was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary s father the persecution over catholics and protestants isn t the only majority in elizabeth elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures and her lover joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love in order to rule successfully the country which she did for more years both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era and both feature a queen elizabeth i judi dench plays her in love or course yet i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love not just because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i but because i found blanchette a more powerful hypnotic sense for the role elizabeth also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough is my pick for the best picture of award it s a dynamic important breathtaking film of loyalty power greed and trust shakespeare would die for the book rights 
the bond series is an island in the film world where else would we look forward to cliches and all of the other things that occur in most of these films where else would pure escapism a vulnerable hero the talking villains blatant product placement predictable action sequences and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change i don t understand it myself but that s what the bond series is based on for i think films we ve mostly got the same thing over and over again with some variation and a bit of change most notably in the two dalton films but even i a king of cynicism can t bitch about it and tomorrow never dies the again i think eighteenth bond film and second brosnan bond film is no exception thank god the plot as in most of them is pure balderdash but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it instead of just plain billionaire psychotics we get a rupert murdoch esque media mogul psychotic elliot carver jonathan pryce looking bitching with a white haired cru cut and always talking like he s out of breath who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war no this is not wag the dog he wants a real war between china and england and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it in comes bond james is sent all around the world trying to do research on carver fighting with his men and running into on more than one occasion a chinese secret agent like him wai lin michelle yeoh asian action star extraordinaire and co star of supercop nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one the two eventually and predictably of course begin working together and yes there is some sexual tension between the two luckily their relationship is never strained and she never gives into his cassanova ness until the finale thank god again in every bond film james bags on average three women sometimes more sometimes less the latter being more potent towards the aids cautionary dalton and he doesn t spoil this one though we never see them of course i mean they need to stay around a pg rating there s always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again the big bond girl yeoh and this time we have an almost cameo by teri hatcher as carver s wife paris who it seems was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning yes teri s very attractive but she seems kind of dull of course it s not really her fault her part is under written and she s only in a small part of it oh well and there are always the big henchmen the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains this time we get a tall arian looking not to mention robert shaw in from russia with love looking guy named stamper goetz otto who is pretty awesome although a bit stiff well mostly his posture really and for a bit of comedy we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point the government people have small parts as usual with q desmond llewelyn looking near death sadly getting only one scene in a more grouchy mood than usual and m judi dench getting more than m usually gets i mean it is judi dench and for no reason whatsoever except cause he was so good in goldeneye joe don baker shows up again as wade admitting he has no reason for being there and is this time more annoying again oh well the action sequences are not a let down although sometimes go on too long they pop up every now and then mainly because they have to for the sake of the series and some significant ones are the opening one one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control and a motorcylce chase on a bmw cycle nonetheless through china streets or was it vietnam the plot s not really essential they re more high tech and feature much more laughs which yeah i dig so what if they re distracting they re supposed to be the acting from most around is great yeoh is actually one of the better bond girls mainly because she s so unique the better bond girls are more independent and have a certain wily ness to them pussy galore with her homoerotic undertones and all is one of the best and diana rigg who married bond at the end of on her majesty s secret service only to be killed added some emotional depth yeoh is notable since she s so active and has great chemistry with brosnan pryce is an awesome villain being slimy and lovable at the same time and brosnan is once again the mack daddy the bond series is built on cliches mainly because they re so fun and add to the escapism if you can remember the dalton years and they re serious direction you remember how unsuccessful they were both financially and aesthetically the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot too many themes and too much characterization i don t really understand it myself yet i m one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states having seen all of them more than once yes i ve seen this twice already you can tell i adore them while it s not one of the best like goldfinger or from russia with love tomorrow never dies is nonetheless a truly awesome installment even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones 
perhaps it s time for me to say a little about my reading habits i really do like to read and i ve enjoyed many books in my lifetime my problem is that i m a slow reader and not very dedicated i ll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time it s taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina even though i m loving the book in addition to this i typically don t read anything created after the th century the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting time after time that i haven t read any of the books on which these films are based the only exception i believe is great expectations however i don t think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film needless to say i haven t read the elmore leonard novel out of sight on which steven soderbergh s new film is based i can t say how faithful of an adaptation it is or if it lives up to leonard s vision i can say that it s a terrific film with sharp acting great dialogue and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh it s certainly a nice distraction from s lineup of brainless blockbusters all hopelessly wishing that size mattered out of sight proves that it doesn t i had originally written george clooney off as a one note actor incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair after seeing his latest performance in this film i ve changed my mind this guy can act but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those million superstars here he plays jack foley a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living he does it because it s fun i think but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won t start he goes to jail which is interesting only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend buddy ving rhames we re then introduced to karen sisco jennifer lopez a u s marshall who conveniently is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes fortunately they take her hostage and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence and since this is a gritty crime comedy flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise at first i kind of felt that it was a gimmick but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction too it s a fun gimmick though and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally i ve only seen a few of soderbergh s films i was impressed both with kafka and sex lies and videotape but i think he s excellent at what he does he s an artist without making it obvious and without being pretentious which is always admirable he uses tricks yes lots of freeze frame stuff here but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film as i said clooney is terrific and he s matched by lopez lopez is of course beautiful but she can act too i can sense that she s honing in on her skills for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u turn the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another the best scene in the film by far is the seduction scene the brilliance of this scene is also due in part to soderbergh for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances layered upon light dialogue and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema meaningful and engrossing the supporting cast is strong led by the always reliable ving rhames dennis farina who plays karen s father is good as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain steve zahn who plays jack s nearly brain dead accomplice glenn steals all of his scenes and that s in a film where every scene is already at a high level all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently constructed script by scott frank out of sight is certainly a light film although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory overall i can recommend it simply as great entertainment not every film has to change your life and it s nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers as for the book this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at 
modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop broadway musical rather than victor hugo s original tome adapted several times for the cinema this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters story and heart of the novel to the screen liam neeson stars as jean valjean as a young man valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger and he was sentenced to years of hard labor for his crimes prison hardened him and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor however an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life and he vows to become a better man however he runs up against one man who doesn t believe in reform inspector javert geoffrey rush is an obsessive law abider he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules even with benign intentions he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served and after valjean breaks his parole javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice two women also get caught up in the struggle fantine uma thurman is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society her daughter cosette mimi newman and later claire danes is her life yet she cannot afford to raise her instead cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo s novel which though omitting some of the political undertones remains true to the overall story and tone of the book hopefully you won t as some clueless members of the audience did wonder where all the songs went the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good but continually haunted by his past the supporting cast is also extraordinary the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson playing the revolutionary marius the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair but it is transitory and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film the novel les misirables is by any account an epic both in its scope and in its length while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation it too is an epic and one worth seeing 
as with his other stateside releases jackie chan s latest chopsocky vehicle mr nice guy is contrived blockheaded and lacking in narrative logic but also like those other films it is a highly enjoyable ride once again chan s screenwriters here edward tang and fibe ma have taken the easy way out and named their star s character simply jackie with no last name this jackie is a world class chef who co hosts a popular cooking show on australian television of course jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter s gabrielle fitzpatrick expose of a drug dealing ring other plot details involving a videotape and a biker gang are irrelevant in fact as is the case with most chan films the plot itself is just about irrelevant the sole purpose of mr nice guy s existence are chan s comic fight scenes and those here do not disappoint director samo hung who has a cameo role a longtime collaborator of chan s does not waste any time putting chan in action diving head on into a wild chase fight shootout after a brief cooking show prologue other impressive set pieces follow most notably a chase in a mall which directly leads to some frenzied if cliched can you say fruit cart business involving a runaway carriage and an extended late film sequence at a construction site in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards cement mixers and a deadly buzzsaw none of the action sequences in mr nice guy are as spectacular as supercop s thrilling helicopter train finale or rumble in the bronx s daring leap between two buildings nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor respectively but the action delivers even if the energy peters out before the film s end the finale as spectacular as it is is a letdown for fans of chan s athletic prowess filmed almost entirely in english even so the voices of some english speaking actors are laughably dubbed mr nice guy hints at jackie chan s latest transition to hollywood productions he made ill fated attempts with s the big brawl and s the protector next in the pipeline is rush hour a stateside production co starring chris tucker hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr nice guy for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands much like they have been before 
are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store wafflemovies com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves everyweek wafflemovies com reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video here is a sample review welcome to sarajevo in light of america s recent intervention in kosovo welcome to

with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding as they make their way down the street a sniper shoots the mother of the bride yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war in this scene we meet joe flynn woody harrelson an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church joe is cocky but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn t even know his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson stephen dillane michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world s lack of interest henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother s death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread he decides to take action when a united nations delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult during his visits he befriends a pre teen girl emira emira nuseric who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner he promises to get emira out of harm s way if he gets the chance after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children henderson loses hope however his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina marisa tomei and her children s aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans unfortunately only babies are wanted for adoption so henderson pledges to take emira to england the group of children nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps the movie was beautifully and sensitively made director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred they show the destroyed lives families that have been split up and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson his producer and flynn have befriended the group of twenty somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life s simplest pleasures and amenities one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth like the rest of those deeply effected by the war this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the olympics winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies com selection mad city we watch them struggle to cover the horror while trying to remain professionally detached however they are human and question the reason behind it all why no one cares and how they can get out stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy henderson realizes that he cannot save the world but he can help a few it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary sandra bullock disaster two if by sea woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest most versatile actors of his generation harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character s caring nature and vulnerability shine through harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men cheers white men can t jump as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one this ability will serve him well and give him a long successful career america s involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict the entire movie most importantly the opening scenes provide a history lesson war is a foreign concept to most of us in america battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world something we don t do

perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects there is no question that action adventure and science fiction action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years such as raiders of the lost ark were made in grand traditional fashion contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion dollar creations of computer technology the latest in this visually awesome series of movies the wachowski brothers the matrix is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie s story unlike many sci fi movies which promote themselves as effects heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event it runs minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film s length contrary to popular trend the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound in this regard the movie is something like a card sharp with its flashy mass stripped away the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented the script is characteristically weak and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach but like the card sharp the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent the viewers don t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner and right around the corner they usually are for the script tells a fast paced albeit frequently revisited story as the movie explains the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence the matrix farms our life energy only a select group of individuals knows of the real world and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra cool morpheus laurence fishburne morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo keanu reeves believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion the set design is very dynamic running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy the costumes as well as the actors who wear them add to the roles for instance the manifested antagonists in the movie a group of agents created by the matrix in its computer program all dress in matching secret servicewear the rebel fighters on the other hand dress in rich hues of leather the casting cannot be criticized for the typically stoic reeves isn t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool supports in carrie anne moss joe pantoliano and hugo weaving are all effectual one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year s science fiction masterpiece dark city particularly if one ponders how this same premise would ve worked from a different approach the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear here the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise the better picture between the two depends on the viewer but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun 
vannesa kensington austin do you smoke after sex austin powers i don t know baby i ve never looked and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season austin powers the sequel to the sleeper hit of is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place myers returns as the swinging s spy and his arch nemesis the bald headed dr evil who is given much of the spotlight here there s an early scene in which dr evil and his son scott seth green appear on a jerry springer segment entitled my dad is evil and wants to take over the world hosted by springer himself most of these talk show gags spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee are no longer as funny as they once were happily this is an exception especially when a fight breaks out between dr evil and the other guests sample dialogue come back here you mother you want a piece of me the audience was in stitches there are many good things about this sequel dr evil is now assisted by mini me verne troyer a pint sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry mini me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does pinkie and all mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina evil s loud mouth assassin sidekick and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber this works surprisingly well afterward there s even a meeting at the coffee machine where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment oh yes the plot after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington elizabeth hurley that goes disastrously wrong powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr evil in the original the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods here it s time travel dr evil has this crazy plan to steal austin s mojo the source of his sexual powers so he jumps through a time portal back into when powers is still is his freezing chamber there he employs a grotesque pound scottish assassin named fat bastard also myers to commandeer the mojo so that our future hero is left completely shagless meanwhile austin is informed of evil s wrong doing by basil exposition michael york and is supplied with his very own time traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle once back in powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell heather graham and learns of dr evil s plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars evil calls the moon base a death star if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke it s austin powers the spy who shagged me ap has many hilarious moments much more so than the original austin powers but what it doesn t have is the confident support system that the first boasted and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit and miss while myers has a knack for delivering clever inspired gags he sometimes doesn t know when to call it quits the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa will ferrell and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner robert wagner as dr evil s man has only one scene early on in the film where he lacks all the focus of the character one nice surprise is rob lowe as the young who patterns wagner s voice and movements right down to a tee there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project and many bits are side splittingly funny don t miss an extended visual gag in a tent where the shadows leave much to the imagination of the new characters graham doesn t leave much of an impression her performance is merely okay and she lacks the gung ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her and as for fat bastard well he provides one or two hilarious moments but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far but my most severe complaint mr bigglesworth was only in one scene but with gritted teeth i managed to get over that this sequel will not leave fans disappointed it s more often than not a laugh riot and i look optimistically to the future where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas we should be in store for much more c jamey hughton jamey hughton has written a weekly column in the starphoenix saskatoon sk since november he was a writing finalist in the canadian ytv achievement awards 
stendhal s syndrome a condition where in the presence of art a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression suicidal behaviour and personality disorder grim stuff to be sure but the subject of a remarkable film from italy s master of the horror thriller dario argento boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento it follows his disappointing american debut trauma the patchy opera and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late s based on the novel by graziella magherini the film stars argento s daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist killer visiting florence to follow up several leads she is lured by the killer alfredo thomas kretschmann to an art gallery a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints posing as a bystander alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer a strange game of cat and mouse begins a gripping story evolves and a coherent one too which may surprise those familiar with argento s often lumpy narratives the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop hunting killer scenario it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character s psychological disintegration the script explores its psycho sexual themes with intelligence and candour perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers but as dark as its themes are the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years argento is once again working in his native italy and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent the film s opening minutes segues between hallucination flashback and real time with tremendous style proof that at his most inspired argento remains one of the world s most exhilarating filmmakers the cast is generally good though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless asia argento s performance is by turns risky awkward and fascinating it s a difficult role and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo and marco leonardi of cinema paradiso and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy does okay as anna s work colleague and increasingly confused love interest but perhaps the stendhal syndrome s single most striking element is ennio morricone s soundtrack active since the s morricone has scored over films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts it s mostly a variation on the one theme a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards it s been three decades since argento and morricone worked together this is a long welcome reunion if the film has a fault it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn t quite reach a completely satisfying climax but by the closing scenes the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento s career note see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web 
the ultimate match up between good and evil the untouchables is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry based on the television show of the same title the untouchables may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences some excellent acting a memorable score and a clever script the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order however as ness soon learns in order to stabilize peace you have to bend a few laws the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes the film begins with capone played perfectly by deniro declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl from this point we know capone is evil not only because he kills without hesitation but also because he is a lying bastard right from the first five minutes of the film de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs this developed hatred is before the film s hero ness is even introduced i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone the film only gets better from this point with the formation of the untouchables there is a group of men wearing long dark overcoats and hats they walk in unison and they only look forward as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films one that comes to mind is the matrix when neo morpheus trinity and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world wearing more futuristic outfits of the same s style the similarities between these two are countless the untouchables has some of the hippest bravest heroes in any action film the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone s army each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others elliot ness played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner is a character that surely grows during the course of the film he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be however as the film develops so does ness his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in sean connery who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role plays malone an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables malone acts as a mentor to ness he teaches him the chicago way to do things when they attack with a knife you attack with a gun connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone a young man who is just becoming a police officer as ness grows he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen also very similar to the matrix they are exciting and intense from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps the scenes are well thought out and well executed the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting great directing and great action some scenes capone and the baseball bat the train station have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned milos forman s first film since the ill fated valmont columbia s the people vs larry flynt is a vastly entertaining if not particularly enlightening biopic of hustler publisher and self made millionaire larry flynt who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late s and early s the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order we open with young and dirt poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky cut to forward in time where the two flynt brothers now young men are running the struggling hustler go go clubs in cincinnati the strip clubs are in a dire financial state and in a last ditch effort to salvage the operations flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter this evolved into the adult periodical hustler magazine creating larry flynt a vast financial empire and the rest is history what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material and who railed and preached against him flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt and his driven single minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression regardless of personal cost the people vs larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt s true love althea leasure whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations considering the serious nature of the film s theme the importance of the united states first amendment the people vs larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light hearted and humourous much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt s outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances some of his chosen apparel is hilarious and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity the film s focus is on the flynt s many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech but the heart of the people vs larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff harsh and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues but with althea we see his loving affectionate side there s a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking ultimately the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors but from the strength of flynt and althea s love for each other woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience and a very compelling protagonist for the film courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn completely raw and impulsive it s a very solid performance brash and naturalistic and love is extremely compelling it s difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen and her chemistry with harrelson is dead on edward norton as flynt s straight level headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co stars in the people vs larry flynt much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film one can sense the frustration that norton s character feels when harrelson s free talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton s isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges milos forman keeps the film moving although it runs over two hours it never drags and his direction of the film is very effective eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic there s also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot which is both clever and extremely entertaining two minor quibbles with the film it certainly seems like the people vs larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech consequently the first thirty minutes of the film introducing and setting up the characters seem unduly rushed perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters the film clearly shows what flynt althea isaacman and rev jerry faldwell did and on a superficial level some of their motivations but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level for example why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton president carter s sister to be born again is a mystery to me then again perhaps it was to him as well these two points don t detract greatly from the film the people vs larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio released films of and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression and as a touching love story 
it s terribly unfortunate that stir of echoes tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of s unsung treasures the trigger effect should be released little more than a month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir of echoes is more of a straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to a psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business stir of echoes is more conventional and predictable in its final twist and where the sixth sense was disturbing stir of echoes is just plain scary i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir of echoes opens with a cute six year old boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking a bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there finally he asks does it hurt to be dead apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn t the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon a chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hard working wife one night while at a party with their closest friends tom convinces maggie s new age sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he wouldn t normally see including a deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months seeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she didn t expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees stir of echoes isn t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and is not only effective on a technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working class family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe s dream with the fishes are top notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through does not try to stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet in a masterfully done entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching a movie screen from inside a theater which is also showing a movie screen in a theater telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly construed as this one truthfully this set piece and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen having loads of fun with her small role as maggie s sister lisa illeana douglas s to die for her last great character is a delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom s visions of the girl she remarks i wouldn t be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she s dead gives one pause also of note are jenny morrison s intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in s whatever as morrison s grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential and it doesn t what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically written characters stir of echoes isn t as good as the sixth sense but why should it need to be both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is a spinetinglingly good horror film 
rated r for strong language sexual dialogue drug use crude humor violence and brief nudity starring ben affleck matt damon linda fiorentino salma hayek alan rickman chris rock kevin smith jason mewes jason lee george carlin alanis morissette running time minutes being a huge fan of kevin smith i was expecting a lot out of his newest project dogma it might just be kevin s best work to date it s very funny with smart and foul mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn t in a little movie premiered at sundance this little film was called clerks and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation you really can t meet a person on this green earth who has not seen clerks it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming in kevin made another movie mallrats that flopped horribly thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in chasing amy came out and was kevin s biggest success to date now in we get a great little movie by the name of dogma wow what a cast ok here is the plot in this movie linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic one day at her house metatron the voice of god appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels matt damon and ben affleck from getting back into heaven by ways of a church ok now get this she is told to find two prophets one who talks a lot and one who doesn t however she gets jay and silent bob instead who give us great performances now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the th apostle falls out of the sky chris rock and helps guide her to find these angels salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way azrael jason lee who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win bethany linda fiorentino has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith what a movie it is everything rolled into one an offensive offbeat smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end and ends up being a feel good movie who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie of course the best and funniest of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob probably the best characters in movies that i like the star studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while the script was written by kevin smith with many f words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well with some classic lines linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay as well as silent bob alan rickman jason lee salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles being oscar winners for the classic good will hunting they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story the movie s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members dogma stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to clerks while being funny at times in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can t deny it dogma will offend people especially deeply religious people but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you all kevin smith fans must see 
the caveman s valentine starring samuel l jackson ann magnuson aunjanue ellis tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green based on his novel directed by kasi lemmons for more film dvd and books about movie reviews plus annual coverage of the toronto international film festival visit film freak central http filmfreakcentral net now with search engine a strange mixture of shine basquiat angel heart and grant morrison dave mckean s graphic novel arkham asylum the caveman s valentine is a feverish tale of a homeless madman cum detective who on the morning of february th discovers a valentine just outside his new york cave one of ella fitzgerald s strange fruit stuck in the crotch of a tree a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building is responsible for the murder romulus samuel l jackson is put on the trail of an avant garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould david leppenraub colm feore his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation romulus was a brilliant julliard trained pianist prior to his psychosis romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police woman daughter aunjanue ellis that even though he s a nut that doesn t mean that he can t solve a high profile society murder every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas and every character the same the caveman s valentine is a concept so high concept that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment with romulus s caveman a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane s urban noir hero spawn with a long vanished wife tamara tunie acting as a spiritual guide the occasional social caste commentary the secret base in a cave a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters and a wickedly colourful arch enemy the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren t inscribed with gotham pd that being said the caveman s valentine can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when in fact the caveman s valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless again like mcfarlane s spawn while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts it is no small detail that our hero romulus is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life in legend without knowledge of his royal birth but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park in the romulus mythology signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures while in the film the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds but of the carrion itself whether or not romulus of the caveman s valentine will found a nation or in the case of novelist george dawes green upon whose novel his own screenplay is based a franchise the fact remains that the caveman s valentine is easily the most misunderstood film of thus far it along with m night shyamalan s unbreakable is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has since miller s seminal the dark knight returns redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics readers of sam keith s brilliant the maxx comic series or of mtv s short lived animated adaptation of the same are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne the failure of both the maxx tv show and of the caveman s valentine not forgetting the initial backlash against unbreakable suggests that the public may not be ready for america s surprising contributions to dark fantasy luxuriantly lit brashly saturated and comic panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent death in venice ca while inhabiting robin standefer s practical magic mesmerizing sets the caveman s valentine is an unremittingly gorgeous film kasi lemmons following up her brilliant debut eve s bayou which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys artists and suffering the caveman s valentine is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape clearly not for every taste when approached with the correct paradigm it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post modern audience with urine stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes the caveman s valentine is a fine and a courageous film crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot s rat s alley wasteland 
the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ which explains why the bard s materials are such a popular source for remakes revisions rewrites inspiration subtlety credit and dispute indeed in recent years american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products including this year s upcoming a midsummer night s dream shakespeare s material has been the cause for twenty six big screen productions since but for a change of pace mrs brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love marc norman and tom stoppard s story is largely fantasy although as the viewer soon learns shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously will shakespeare of the s would ve been married to anne hathaway and he would ve had a teenage daughter and two young sons here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play and his current comedy in the works romeo and ethel the pirate s daughter just doesn t quite seem right with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe rupert everett and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies romeo and juliet the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet to great effect fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy the supporting roles are well filled out from geoffrey rush as will s worrisome agent philip to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman even ben affleck leading the troupe of actors manages to make a favorable impression and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i gwyneth paltrow is by far however the standout of the lot creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance the story is well crafted if nothing else although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the let s make a movie genre the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted and certainly accessible by the audience s lowest common denominator there s something for everyone in this romantic comedy making it prime date flick material although certainly not inspiring in any regard it revels in a wholesome well rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of s pictures the true love story is one of the best around certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year s open releases is just around the corner 
i ve always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable death and taxes oddly i ve never given much thought to either of the two maybe if i did at least i d stop getting collection notices from uncle sam yes let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping hold on to all my receipts and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake free and will keep me from incurring penalties it seems that the issue of death may not be so different at least envisioned here in this film as this tender love story goes if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty the dreams wishes and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true for those who die with a burdened soul however they wind up in that other place chris and annie a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie s happiness and when chris dies after a terrible car accident she commits suicide a tortured soul who blames herself despair is perhaps the greatest sin and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity chris on the other hand has made it to heaven and upon learning of annie s fate he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare this film brims with imagination containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares it s shape and look is as infinite as our imagination as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous he also begins to learn more about himself certain questions baffle him at first why does his home in heaven ooze with paint what is the significance of the asian stewardess why does he have an all too willing guide cuba gooding jr to help him find annie but as he slowly begins to realize the answers it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie dreams is both visually and tellingly beautiful alas i have one regret the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments however your eyes will still well up with tears and you ll find lots to savor the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed the journey is imaginative and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film 
jamaica is a hot vacation spot the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth approximately jamaican dollars to one american the sea is a brilliant blue the air is warm but lacks humidity and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica s biggest trade foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid it guides the audience along a tourist s journey and the story of the native inhabitants instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen it quips you don t see what happens after you flush the toilet this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there this strong sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals this isn t just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation from field to factory as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not of course as can be expected the united states is slammed owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica s economy will help the country back on its feet but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u s is forcing on the citizens admittedly some of the back and forth between the business minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument but jamaica isn t against the united states and this documentary does not accuse the u s of being the sole perpetrator of its grief if anything it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations 
jake kasdan son of one of the best screenwriters around breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard to categorize detective story part mystery part comedy part character study and part romance for the most part kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film daryl zero bill pullman is a modern day sherlock holmes the parallel is present down to his love of music though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin and his addiction to drugs amphetamines rather than morphine he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces the case about the man who lied about his age or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes however zero s observance of the fine art of detachment though it makes him a brilliant private investigator makes him somewhat of a self imposed outcast in society he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr watson i mean steve arlo ben stiller arlo is not happy with his job he is thrilled to be around zero s brilliance but his bizarre behavior and strange requests are frustrating to the former lawyer and they re even more so to his girlfriend jess angela featherstone who is fed up that her boyfriend s boss means more to arlo than her this is the situation when a new case comes knocking gregory stark ryan o neill hires zero to find his lost keys it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence now stark is being blackmailed and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end to solve this case zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell however this is when he is vulnerable and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic gloria sullivan kim dickens who may be involved in the blackmail scheme for the first time zero has to question his own objectivity as he finds his client less and less sympathetic zero effect is weakest in its obviously wacky scenes depicting daryl zero s odd behavior such scenes might be appropriate in an out and out satire making zero an ace ventura ish character however there s a much meatier movie in here it just takes a while to get out that s not to say that there s not a place for humor in this film in fact some of the best scenes are ben stiller s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer however the over the top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film and they aren t funny enough to stand on their own once the investigation is underway however zero s brilliance really begins to shine his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock s own as the mystery begins to unfold zero s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions but never lose the viewer zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well zero s relationship with gloria is low key but it hits all the right notes however we are always kept distant from gloria s character she s given plenty of development but we never understand what she is thinking perhaps that may be intentional to place the audience in zero s zone of detachment but on the whole it is frustrating bill pullman when he s not spacing out creates a vibrant character in daryl zero there s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years and it is shockingly moving expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character but one which fits in well and although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called zero seriously it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name although zero effect is a bit awkward in places it is a strong debut for kasdan and shows great promise 
copyright graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives sid james plays henry who no sooner has the film started is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon as part of his alliance with france he requests the hand in marriage to the queen of normandy joan sims she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath he is totally averse to the idea of marriage henry s court is very corrupt with the cardinal terry scott trying to bribe cromwell kenneth williams and cromwell trying to bribe the king there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen sims in the tower of london ready for execution the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey who has a rather lecherous character to play this time the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices owing to circumstances sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn t this is because of renewed threats by the king of france peter gilmore to come over himself which in the end he does by then henry has found himself a new queen played by none other than barbara windsor it looks like he has some explaining to do there are stand out performances by sid james as henry joan sims as marie and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth who plays barbara s father the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good there is even an early appearance from david prowse who later became the green cross code man and darth vader the film does have it s downsides though as it is getting pretty routine for the carry on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw who could have helped the film along however overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone s while to sit down and watch it 
trekkies roger nygard s energetic and hilarious documentary brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non fans alike the film generally writes off the trekkies vs trekker polemic as not worth arguing about the good spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable loud giggles yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe denise crosby who played tasha yar on star trek the next generation serves as the host in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary oed the oed cites a february caption in the new yorker as the first recorded usage of the word unless you ve been to the conventions i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans one pointed out apologetically that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams arguably the most famous of all the trekkies she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die hard fans do her claim to fame is that as a juror on the whitewater trial she wore it in court as well every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan like stoicism she says describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession she doesn t quite understand all of the uproar i m an officer of the federation hours a day she reminds us her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith along with the laugher the show evokes there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment few other avocations could give this much satisfaction these people are having the time of their lives for the record i m not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies the film interviews the various star trek series s stars as well as its fans the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade but over twenty years later the conventions are still going strong filled with anecdotes the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions at one the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel after appearing briefly he drank some water and left they decided to auction off his half empty glass joking that it had the q virus the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity not just flitting among people the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies one guy is a trekkie cross dresser another dresses her cat and then there is the dentist the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set he his oral hygienists his receptionist his wife and his kids wear the outfits all of the time it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home but not his family for variety he and his family do change characters from time to time he says his patients like it well there was this one complainer but he had a problem with his bill anyway there are summer schools for klingon with ph d linguists to teach the language hamlet is now available in klingon albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore and they are working on translating the bible they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs even u s customs the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series s larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns sandwiched in between the levity the switch in tone doesn t work the incessantly up beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator he fits right in trekkies runs a breezy it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages 
historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early s for many critics scholars and most importantly film producers it was a thing of the past something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black and white television and non cgi special effects but in same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre and same as in the case of dances with wolves he was awarded for his effort with oscars the name of the film was braveheart and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace in his time english king edward i longshanks played by patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by ius primae noctis and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights although english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played by mel gibson doesn t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron played by catherine maccormack murron s death changes that and wallace takes arms and together with small but dedicated band of followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country through time more and more people join his ranks and in wallace s rag tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played by angus macfadyen who wouldn t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson so it wouldn t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann however even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale like vision of picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights in shining armour gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle where hand to hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details never seen since verhoeven s ultra naturalistic flesh blood compared with this naturalistic approach most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays braveheart also employs humour at the right places not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences but also to underline its down to earth atmosphere so different from previous historical epics what makes braveheart larger than life is his protagonist mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and as a result character of th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late th century comic book hero wallace is more than superior to his enemies both physically and mentally yet he is able to show his sensitive more vulnerable side naturally when the character is based on epic poems most of historical accuracy is going down the drain which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in s however even those who don t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel played by sophie marceau and make her a child because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scenes aren t as effective as they should be mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema brendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boorman s general is also very good as wallace s trusted companion as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy stricken king john balliol david o harra is very entertaining as wallace s irish ally and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience stricken character of robert the bruce women in this film have rather thankless roles especially marceau as one dimensional french princess catherine mccormack as wallace s wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early on from the technical point of view the film is also very good photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen on the other hand the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern day instruments for period piece set in medieval times although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism the main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of longshank s son prince edward played by peter hanly he is not only presented as a villain but also as one of the less competent in villain s camp and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct hollywood to make things even more obvious good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals however although the message of this film might look right wing it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in th century according to that ideology oppressed classes workers peasants are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and as such they are more radical less willing to make compromises and more efficient on the other hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety in the end whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre 
with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately what with that whole clinton thing going on you know million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern oh please government waste my taxes just a bit more would you it s about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement with this and crimson tide he s created two successfully chilly films that are interesting exciting even pretty smart but never totally riveting as cinema and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them and was appropriately scary and all but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant enemy of the state is the same way it s engrossing for its entire running time and it s scary the way that it shows a man s decent into kafkaism but it s too technical it s too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be it casts will smith one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he s charming and witty and never uninteresting and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person i hate to do this but last year s film the game got it damn perfect it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling but also the best mindfuck of the entire year not that i want every kafkaesque film to be the game this year s the spanish prisoner succeeds with less thrills and chills but it should be an example of what works and what doesn t will smith s character is frankly too perfect at least too movie perfect he had an affair with another woman lisa bonet ha ha but his relationship with his wife regina king is basically fine regardless he has a kid and he s raking in money as a lawyer albeit a very good and reasonably moral one so he generally doesn t have any real problems as a human being and is therefore boring except that he is played by will smith who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering id men in black territory he s a good dramatic actor just see the first half hour of six degrees of separation for proof of this not that he isn t great the whole time and here he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party a nature observer played by uh jason lee the government wants the disk and is prepared to destroy his life to get it as smith s plight is dramatized we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him sitting in vans disguised as other businesses staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet these guys played by jack black jamie kennedy and seth green are the most interesting part of this film because they re well fascinating they re doing their jobs which are evil but the film doesn t view them as such and they almost become our friends we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn t automatically judge them as the villains they re also scary because we get the idea that they re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world it s as if they re obsessed with their jobs not because they re evil but because hey it s a fun job and no one else can do it like them unfortunately this also backfires a bit on the film instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that the game was you see everything and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on sure you re chilled but you re not exacty freaked out by what s going on but what do you expect from tony scott the man who never met a five second piece of film he ever liked he s a not bad director because hell he is always interesting to watch if not occasionally moronic exhibit a days of thunder but the reason he s not great is because he s too technical and calculated his shots are perfectly executed and leave nothing to the imagination and they re always making sure you re paying attention this is incredibly annoying and it reduces enemy of the state to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths but still manage to entertain without any real problems despite never actually becoming great it s never actually boring and it s always intriguing watching the government set up smith is endlessly fascinating and since we care about smith s likeable protagonist we are set up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy esque entertainment add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos and you ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith s plight without a minute s worth of boredom 
after hearing reviews for woody allen s upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring to just so so my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time woody allen s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand in hand manhattan really is one of the best looking films i ve ever seen beautiful black and white photography of the city s best areas etc a fan can t help but feel visibly moved the film opens up with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with an airplane beethoven s th blasts on the soundtrack the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment and it s all rather lovely to look at and then we cut to a film crew shooting this as the film s hilariously banal key moment in the film where the lead actress in the film melanie griffith looking as buxom and beautiful as ever has to realize something s wrong with her life or whatever it s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film with the great opening shots or without and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works though for the record last year s deconstructing harry came awfully close what the hell has happened to him the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas bullets over broadway though wonderful relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off mighty aphrodite is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story everyone says i love you was more of a great idea than a great film even deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in a way even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films if anything the reception of celebrity by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time it s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is it s him celebrity is yes a good film but it s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film instead of creating the great woody allen world he s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about and he s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections it s like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis woody becoming more insecure in his old age choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead much has been said about his performance dead on but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh s performance though featuring some of the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots o hand gestures is hardly a warts and all impersonation branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm which actually allows for his character s flaws to be more apparent woody s a flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because he s really funny and really witty and really intelligent branagh s allen is a bit more flat out bad but with the same charm so that yes we like him but we re still not sure if he s really a good person or not his character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hits on extra actress winona ryder then goes off to interview griffith who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her and she denies him sorta we then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script a bank robbery movie but with a deep personal crisis as such he has divorced his wife of several years allen regular judy davis and continues on a quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film after griffith comes his escapades with a model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad to see allen is using new jokes ha ha who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen a relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades with ryder whom he fancies most of all his story is juxtaposed with that of davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status while lee is fumbling about selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy i ve become the kind of woman i ve always hated and i m loving it without doing a thing the result is a film of highs and mediums the mediums are what take up most of the film with sitations and scenes which don t exactly work but you can t help but pat allen on the back for trying but other places are really great scenes the opening the sequence with theron which is so good that i wished it hadn t ended a banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll as ever and perhaps the best sequence a romp with hot as hell teen idol brandon darrow played by none other than leo dicaprio who is so un dicaprio esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film they d never look at him the same way he ignites the screen with intensity and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read and finds himself on a wild all day ride with him they go to atlantic city to watch a fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow gets it on with his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupies allen s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them i d almost recommend the film almost but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it s a mess despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself it s still a smart and insightful film though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities as it may seem to be if it were it d be extremely out of touch but about those who want to be celebrities and how they equate celebrity hood with happiness we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they re really happy they may appear to be on the surface but we do get close enough to lee and davis character lee is obsessed with the phenomenon while davis takes is at arm s length and never gets too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself besides it s witty and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen s that great woody allen feel it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject and yes as a part of woody allen s oeuvre it s merely a blip no annie hall but it s no shadows and fog either but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice 
lisa cholodenko s high art is an intelligent quiet drama its strongest quality aside from the top notch central performances is the perceptive way in which the film also written by cholodenko observes its characters they are all flawed people some more troubled than others but they are not judged judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers parts because no one no matter how bad off they are deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of syd radha mitchell a year old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james gabriel mann has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high profile photography magazine frame she very much enjoys where her career is headed but is often not taken very seriously by her managers who are always giving her petty jobs to do when she knows she could be doing more important things one night while taking a bath syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers so when she goes up there to inform them of it she meets lucy beliner ally sheedy a thin worn out and unhappy woman who lives with her drug addicted german girlfriend greta patricia clarkson a pathetic former actress who is usually so out of it that she often is in and out of conciousness syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before lucy claims she doesn t want to get back into the profession but syd manages to convince the frame editors to do a piece on her work all the while syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons high art is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger coated or idealized but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere while syd s luck begins to rise the film in no way is about lesbianism but about love which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other even if the relationship might be doomed with this picture ally sheedy s star has risen once again thanks to her touching nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy a woman who in the course of a decade has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs which has taken away her once blossoming career her characted really is tragic and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem and her mother matter of factly responds by saying she can t help her is heartbreaking although not autobiographical sheedy has had drug problems in her past and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy s footsteps to her role also very good is radha mitchell as syd who previously starred in the slight australian comedy love and other catastrophes wh caught me by surprise with her performance easily being able to pass as christina ricci s older sister mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently as accurate as almost every detail is in high art i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james who played by gabriel mann is left with a throwaway role by the time he finds out about syd and lucy he disappears from the film and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other this is a very minor fault however in a film that is full of riches although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems the character of dominique anh duong the frame editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas was also written to be far more mature than expected and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done for once it did not invlove steaminess or violent sexual activity or gratuitous nudity but focused on the actual characters who love each other and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex high art which won the screenwriting award at the sundance film festival marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko as well as sheedy s strongest and best role to date 
you know you re in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question s most normal character such is the case with the big lebowski joel and ethan coen s first venture since their fargo nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods there s no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment because lebowski is an effort that makes words like strange and unusual seem like an understatement thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all encompassing sense of humor the film is a smashing success the central oddball here is the dude jeff bridges an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot drinking beer and going bowling are you college students already rooting for him or what one night a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet a threatening act that s supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire david huddleston who shares his birth name jeff lebowski with the dude once the dude realizes this coincidence he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter john goodman a hotheaded vietnam vet and donny buscemi a mild mannered surfer before too long soon though lebowski s trampy trophy wife bunny tara reid is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom and he turns to the dude for help it seems bunny s troubles are related to a line of work she s kept secret from her husband she s actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn the dude now on lebowski s payroll accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself chaos obviously ensues and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops crooks and lebowski s ultra eccentric artist daughter maude julianne moore the big lebowski deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that fargo did while that black comedy was certainly a better film lebowski is at least as breathtakingly imaginative the movie boasts a mile high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over but thankfully never does the coens joel directed ethan produced and both wrote keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick whether we re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley esque dream sequence the big lebowski is immensely lively there are those who will dislike this film but not because it s boring the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they re given bridges exudes a likeable surprisingly sweet presence his dude sure isn t the cleanest guy around but you d still follow him to another movie goodman merits s first oscar consideration as walter s manic temper is one of the big lebowski s many highlights the same goes for moore whose throaty delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction sam elliott s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start and some will recognize peter stormare fargo s silent heavy as carl hungus a porn star who s really a samurai sword wielding german nihilist and has been pop star only in its final third does the movie falter with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call these flaws are forgivable though the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it s hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face without a doubt the big lebowski is the best film so far this year sure we re only three months in and the competition deep rising desperate measures the wedding singer etc has been pretty bland but it s still the gospel truth maybe during next awards season lebowski won t be a far cry from fargo 
i rented brokedown palace last night blind having heard nothing about it beforehand and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety that is no easy task superficially it bears an unfortunate and not necessarily unintended resemblance to several other movies notably return to paradise and midnight express as a result nearly every review of brokedown palace i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons the consequence was nearly universal condemnation which is a shame as this is a fine film for those who have yet to view the movie let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system as was midnight express nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of return to paradise in my view if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad s acclaimed novel lord jim problematically the basic storyline seems more than familiar two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set up involving a suave con man a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world justice system the girls are alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale they re life long buddies who planned a high school graduation trip to hawaii and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents once there they find a hotel and go sight seeing which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them but they are saved from hotel security by a charming friendly australian nick daniel lapaine who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl s scam he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves first toward alice then toward darlene by now alarm bells are going off among viewers the ever present nick is too slick and his stories don t add up to us the girls of course are too naive to notice long before it happens we re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag literally containing heroin just as predictably the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison bound for a long stretch left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice for those in need of a ready answer might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl s fleabag hotel as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer fixer yankee hank bill pullam and his thai born partner wife a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film s tag lines who do you trust and hank is no exception although seasoned movie goers and those familiar with pullman s oeuvre will find few surprises much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short hand fashion lou diamond phillips for instance plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank withholds vital information at crucial moments is he part of a wider conspiracy with an inherently powerful if somewhat tired premise the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama a prison story and a potential character study of american teens their relationship and what constitutes friendship between them the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful with the girls interaction hank s investigation and the various trials and hearings offering hope for their release delivering tension as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape if brokedown palace has a major flaw it is its creators tendency like time constrained tourists to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half way down and return to the story s main avenue and if that were all there was to brokedown palace it wouldn t be a very good movie but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and in this they succeeded for the main theme of the movie like the proffered name of its location is freedom in all its permutations ultimately the other sub themes may be considered window dressing young and pretty alice danes is an old soul a wild streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang dark and light is her cautious best friend darlene beckinsale clear eyed and straightforward alice is more complex than her friend she comes from a poorer background has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone including her own father whereas darlene s life is on track aimed at college marriage kids a career a suburban home middle age and fulfillment alice s is uncertain unfocused and yearning one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors friends and relatives from home whose lives continue while hers is in limbo tellingly alice is present but not included just as revealing of their different personalities when alice and dar first come to thailand the openness and delight on alice s face doesn t read as simple naivet the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat reaching toward the sun she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom while dar remains seated in the shade brokedown palace begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank however unintentional it s all alice s fault she s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film s beginning darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison dar of course is the willing dupe which in her view confers innocence never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate dar is innocent it doesn t matter alice is the subject of this movie she and her journey toward personal freedom along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half baked sensibilities and materialistic goals in the end that culture like its representatives yankee hank and dar s father a man who knows how to grease the wheels proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl s tragedy thailand s culture contrary to most opinion comes off much better by comparison it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes i believe the filmmaker s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior the thai with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native born their prison in stark contrast to the probable reality was no hellhole being relatively clean and sunlit the prison authorities demanded good hygiene provided medical care when needed and hard manual labor consisted of picking grass the thai guards were authoritarian what else but certainly not routinely sadistic as for the thai justice system the reasoning of the thai judges during both an appeal hearing and in the film s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality freedom has many faces and brokedown palace explores many of them in the extreme we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter but freedom seldom comes without a price which is why the movie s other tag lines are what is your dream and how far would you go i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom incarcerated or not by film s end is alice she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact kate beckinsale s character might more properly be likened to the released temple bird referred to twice during the film trained to fly back to its cage as the thai magistrate observed in the film s climactic scene the issue was always one of character and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that freedom is achieved within oneself if one thinks back over the movie which character was transformed by their experiences increasingly the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of kung fu woman female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures here at last is the story of a modern heroine in reading the many user s comments i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon whether or not a person liked the movie almost everyone praised the actors think about that when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it but raving about all the performances in it do yourself a favor rent brokedown palace and watch it with a open mind there s more there than meets the eye 
the latest epos from lars is a blast although a rather moody one this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the something the church calvinistic is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower they are considered being too unrestrained in these surroundings we find the to be weds jan and bess played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess is just bess a bit naive and innocent in every aspect of the word at first at the wedding party we are told an anecdote illustrating her infinite kindness she once lend a bike to an stranger her best friends bike however but bess is suffering in this scary religious society we soon take part in a funeral where a man fallen off the orthodox path is laid to rest while doomed to hell women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend almost manic that her friends try to calm her down a bit the time has come when jan is to return to the rig bess is falling into the darkness of depression her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves she can t stand the thought of life without her husband we witness her dialogues with god she speaks both parts paranoia convincing god to return jan from the oilrig and her prayers are heard an accident on the rig bring him back paralysed from the neck and down now he can t satisfy her need for physical love he try to persuade her into finding a lover with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail at first she resist but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply imagine what this is doing to the poor girl the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby accompanied by music from the era procol harum deep purple t rex and others the use of hand held camera and lack of any make up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant though a bit too gloomy for my taste i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue le matin and bitter moon lunes de fiel emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances this must be the reason for giving it the grand prix du jury in cannes this year although we had hoped for the palme d or the screenplay is now available in print the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july just in time for the danish premiere 
in october of audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer the film went on to gross over million dollars in the u s and even developed a cult following much like the previous year s million dollar grossing scream when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend it looked like a wonderful follow up did it live up to the first film the answer is no jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before she has been so upset since the incident nightmares haunt her all over the place but she has to move on she know attends college and is best friends with a funny outgoing girl named karla brandy who is trying to hook julie up with will benson played by newcomer matthew settle karla s boyfriend is tyrell the funny outgoing type who is played by soul food s mekhi phifer freddie prinze jr also returns as ray julie s boyfriend from a year ago one morning julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil of course they answer it correctly and they are off to the bahamas julie wants ray to come but he declines the offer so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie after they arrive at their hotel it is just them and the staff on the island it starts off as the weekend of their dreams something just had to come to mess up the one care free weekend of julie s life though ben willis muse watson is back and he isn t letting anyone survive this time will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances brandy in particular was impressive considering this is her first feature film you could see that the characters were horrified and they would do anything possible to survive matthew settle and freddie prinze jr are a completely different story let s start with settle matthew is completely fake in this film you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth you could tell he was acting and its reasons like him that this one isn t as good as the first one he does do a good job towards the end but that doesn t clear up the scars he already left on the film freddie prinze jr is almost as bad as matthew settle was he is almost completely unbelievable and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place we don t see him as much as settle otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell but yet again the dialogue is out of place the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one it would have been a bit better the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel the sound is pretty good but still not as creepy as the first film s jennifer love hewitt s song how do i deal is also played for about thirty seconds i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film the first film was very suspenseful and it contained some very memorable scenes the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up and almost reached the same level as the first film before this part in the film there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares that is okay though because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes i think the reason this film wasn t as scary as the original was because in the first one the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident he made them suffer for what they did in the second film ben willis just kills anyone he feels like he doesn t stick with ray and julie who were the ones he is actually after he had to go after karla will and tyrell if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie ray helen and barry it could have been much better and it would have made a lot more sense the bottom line not a disappointment but a third in the series would be out of hand 
i love this movie and i ve just seen for the umptenth time unfortunately it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it it s my mission in life to spread the word see this movie fred george doug and howie are reaching middleage three of them have a wife kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay only fred is still a bachelor together they take the local train every morning to work in town on one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night since they always split everything four ways they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well kathy however kathy isn t completly honest to them in fact she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male with these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper ok have one thing clear though the romantic rendezvous between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent the script stays above the waist or to be precise above the neck noboyd claims that kathy is their mistress the four guys call her their companion the censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above years but that only shows how long ago was small children could watch this without being corrupted kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies i liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife tony randall is funny as always was more than years ago how many accountants copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work this is the white middle class i can t remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology 
curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy but its humour won t appeal to everyone to be specific let me give you an example do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny don t see curdled on the other hand if you found that sequence to be pretty funny you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at our film s heroine gabriela played by angela jones is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles luckily for her miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage her scrapbook is getting pretty big the killer s nickname in the press is the blue blood killer because he preys on older rich socialite women and he s played by william baldwin this is not a spoiler one particularly striking m o on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests she immediately quits her job and signs on with pfcs which stands for post forensic cleaning service no points for guessing what they do her workmates are confused by gabriela s fascination with murder to them it s just a day job there s a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk and what they would say gabriela s partner elena played by mel gorham is particularly perturbed by gabriela s wide eyed fascination and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer s latest scene they re the messiest you see unbeknownst to them the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer so he s also heading over there the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental quentin tarantino executive produced this film which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature length film there are other parallels the star of curdled is angela jones the top billing goes to william baldwin but really jones is the central character who s probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos the death obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film curdled jr jones is great in curdled she s wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character s innocence or likeability she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow it s a great performance reb braddock s direction is extremely sharp and clever toeing the line between black humour and bad taste the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing any more than that would be a spoiler the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing of course it s impossible to really take this stuff seriously but then again you re not really supposed to braddock knows the audience is in on the joke and makes it a fun little romp as a result the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film and it feels like it the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time and some parts just seem to drag while its running time is already a short minutes it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax it ll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well 
it s wednesday march and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte south carolina the crime a young prostitute elizabeth renee zellweger has been brutally slain one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority miles away the police duo of braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are strapped for leads at the moment they have only one possible suspect wayland tim roth a wealthy unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act that s the premise for deceiver a new thriller from the pate brothers jonas and josh who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not so bright cops captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland s iq is by contrast kennesaw s is and braxton s is the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered over three days as wayland returns to answer more questions the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until inevitably it boils over other plot elements are thrown in for good measure wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can in stressful situations render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent braxton a compulsive gambler is deep in debt to a local syndicate and kennesaw is haunted by a dark abusive side that delights in terrorizing women especially his wife rosanna arquette whom he suspects of being unfaithful the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth s death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand the suspect or his questioners deceiver which mostly transpires in a dimly lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue has the feel of a david mamet play edgy claustrophobic and tense the atmosphere is explosive and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting deceiver has the power to grab an audience unfortunately in the end it succumbs to the need to throw in one last unexpected twist and this is its undoing for while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers it also stretches our credulity too much and raises more questions than it answers it s only an effective wrap up if you don t think too carefully about its full implications of course the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic police procedure is totally ignored and it s almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction not plot details deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth s final days and hours the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice over by visually showing what really happened moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks the movie obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir drips atmosphere there are some fascinating stylistic touches for example although the setting is contemporary all of the telephones are old fashioned rotary models cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver s look some of the things he tries mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow work exceptionally well while others like any of several lazy susan shots seem more like unnecessary visual tricks as wayland tim roth gives the film s top performance despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he s supposed to be the other two leads chris penn and michael rooker aren t as effective both play their characters like familiar types penn s performance is uninspired rooker s lacks subtlety some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors renee zellweger in a role that s miles away from her star making turn in jerry maguire brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw s wife and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who s entrusted with evaluating wayland s condition one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience plot points aren t hammered home and although the ending has its weaknesses everything isn t spelled out in bold letters the pates give audience members credit for having brains which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers occasionally gripping and never uninteresting deceiver is a fine noir effort 
capsule this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii life in a japanese prison camp to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone s taste to more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law during world war ii of course the one goal was winning the war this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal when the japanese had captured prisoners they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output while the germans not known for their kindness in those days had a mortality rate among captured prisoners of war the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story perhaps for fear of offending the japanese there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps certainly there was david lean s the bridge on the river kwai there were some low budget british exploitation films and that was about it then there were tv series a town like alice and tenko lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for years the dean of the chapel at princeton university the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad it turns out to be a grim joke one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves beating and torture are commonplace events men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable however unlike as in kwai the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital called by the prisoners the death house so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail laying machine this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies the japanese believe that the individual is nothing that conformity to group s norms is all that gives a life meaning conformity is purpose before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story if the british with one american by the way and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story it is neither it is a stirring and believable account of camp life the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow this serves a double purpose for cunningham it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat it also creates a distancing effect the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience i rate it a on the to scale and a on the to scale 
 say any of you know how to madison brad asshole majors barry bostwick shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend in the early s stage actor turned first time playwright richard o brien decided he wanted to make a musical

sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters a year later something entirely strange and magical happened prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country and it was then that a whole new audience found the film this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played yelling rude comments at the screen and just generally having a good time word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show s life as the ultimate cult film was born for the virgins out there who are unaware the plot centers around a loving couple brad majors barry bostwick and janet weiss susan sarandon who come from a small town called denton brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting dr everett scott jonathan adams who played the narrator in the original stage version but their car gets a flat on the way to his home remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual in the galaxy of transylvania who are lead by the eccentric fishnet stocking wearing mad scientist dr frank n furter tim curry frank n furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky peter hinwood as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank n furter s mad schemes little do any of them know that the doctor s handyman riff raff original author richard o brien and domestic magenta patricia quinn are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth going back and revisiting this film after ten years being the first time i had ever seen it it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release i don t think i would have known what to make of it either for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie though bad in a really good sort of way but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film by the time the credits role it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters and one really gets the feeling that richard o brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b movies his film is based on when i say that the wall to wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that once you hear them they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity it goes without saying that the time warp is the most popular song in the film even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song what those who haven t seen the movie don t know though is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment my personal favorite is over at the frankenstein place but dammit janet is also maddeningly catchy tim curry s vocals on the rocking tune sweet transvestite need to be heard to be believed the finale of the film a big floor show staged by frank n furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets including barry bostwick frightening features no less than four songs rose tint my world don t dream it wild and untamed thing and i m going home all of which are immensely singable the film s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though despite the catchiness of the songs this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans unless you don t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place note director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film in the form of a sequel resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment which picks up with brad and janet this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager also played by de young who wishes to claim janet as his own o brien returned as a writer performer on the project as did quinn campbell and gray in performance capacity only but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original years later this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans a brand new special edition disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its th anniversary if you are one of those people who can t get enough of the film this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film fox home entertainment has released this wonderful disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of enhanced for x televisions the film is presented in two different versions the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called superheroes for ambitious viewers the disc also includes a hidden version located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen originally the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz with the first half of the it seen in black and white and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number most reports including a documentary on the disc say that the color was supposed to appear when frank n furter first shows up in the elevator but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced the film contains a commentary track by show creator and faithful handyman richard o brien and co star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half naked on freezing cold sets which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore and there are quite a few fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments the first feature and the most simple is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is the second feature is an audience participation track which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd where a pair of lips will appear on screen during certain scenes of the film mostly during the musical numbers that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote when selected you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world once the segment is over you are deposited right back into the film where you left off the first disc also contains a few dvd rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation a video jukebox a you don t know jack styled trivia game which is about as bare bones a you don t know jack parody as it can be and a bizarre mad libs styled word game known as riff raff s story lab links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd rom portion of the disc the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras former lite rock video channel turned music historians vh have allowed some of their outtake footage from the behind the music rocky horror special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here as well as a pop up video for the meat loaf sung hot patootie the behind the music segments are all very interesting especially richard o brien s jaunt through the castle which is now a hotel where the film was originally shot there are also extensions of the sarandon bostwick quinn o brien and meat loaf interviews as far as extras for the film itself go there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here one of which is just the superheroes number available in the uk version but there is also another rare musical number presented here called once in a while a series of alternate takes are also presented here but none of them are really much of a revelation except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick s pants for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show two theatrical trailers proclaiming that the film is a different sort of jaws a still gallery and two sing a longs for toucha toucha touch me and sweet transvestite fox s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives you re lucky i m lucky he s lucky we re all lucky it s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u s but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format as with their excellent dvds of the abyss fight club independence day and the sound of music fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want i raise a toast to them cue the throwing of the bread as i cut out the lights sit back and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b movie tradition

i have seen several but not that many woody allen movies i didn t particulary like radio days the purple rose of cairo play it again sam i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything sex and i loved might aphrodite however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore and bullets got some very raving reviews but i didn t think i d like but i finally saw it double feature with ready to wear i think and hated it since i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn t sure if i d want to see thankfully i did people burst into singing and dancing something i hardly ever like but this movie is so infectious and funny and entertaining and unlike evita they only sing when they need to sure some of the actors may not be great singers but they seems to be having a great time and so does the audience that s all i have to say really if you think that is going to be a dull movie you re probably dead and dead people should not be forced into movie theatres is mark leeper dead he said that this is an almost ghastly misfire the movie is rated r for one use of the word motherf 
my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance or a movie that we ve all seen a million times two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins this is exactly what happened in this movie but fortunately they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way the movie starts with a quick and i do mean quick glance of two presidents russell kramer jack lemmon and matt douglas james garner william haney dan aykroyd and ted matthews john heard are the new president and vice president there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead this movie was exceptional for many reasons one being that they found people lemmon and garner that have good chemisty together they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly one being a ladies man and one being the old man i ll let you fiqure which is which also they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman except then he was a congressman experience counts for a lot 
capsule the world will come to an end at midnight everyone knows it and must make a final peace with the last hours of their lives this is an intelligent science fiction film with no special effects just personalities and ideas high to it is the last night of the planet and several different people are reacting each in their own way to the end the film covers pm to midnight the main character is patrick played by david mckellan who also wrote and directed reminiscent of on the beach but much more so of a story richard matheson wrote the last day p s on rereading the matheson this film is almost a loose adaptation of that story the similarities may be mere coincidence but they are numerous and they are very striking us release may be problematical the title is lackluster and non memorable though very appropriate when you know about the film also provincial americans may not care about the end of the world coming to toronto they probably would feel it would not affect them perhaps a pbs release would be possible patrick s family has declared it christmas and are hurt that the adult children will not spend the whole evening with them grocery stores mostly looted it seems though that one of everything is left some people continue business as usual some want sex some react with religion some riot some people are in total denial much comedy much drama very canadian cast it does not get dark it is just always daytime radio playing last night i didn t get to sleep at all how appropriate david cronenberg as a kind of bland functionary manager at the gas company genvieve bujold as french teacher visiting former student science fiction film with no special effects cost about two million dollars the person you have been thrown together with by chance becomes the most important person to you for the rest of your life why would it be so precisely at midnight what about other time zones what is the nature of what is destroying the world 
once again the battle is dreamworks versus disney earlier this year the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end of the world asteroid flicks deep impact and armageddon here we are now just a few months later and they re at it again with dueling bug movies antz and a bug s life what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution i mean come on what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer animated films about bugs as was the case with the meteor movies disney has come out on top though antz is a likable movie a bug s life is far superior in fact this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz i became immersed in the world of a bug s life while antz just made me scrutinize everything but it s not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison a bug s life is a remarkable film in its own right and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer animated film about bugs in fact it s one of the best films this year it s smart subtle and funny but it s also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining i haven t had such a good time at the movies in months it tells the story of an ant named flick voice by dave foley he s a nice guy but he s also a troublemaker the ants spend all season putting together the offering a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers just before the grasshoppers come flick accidentally knocks over the offering and ruins everything for the entire colony the grasshopper s leader hopper kevin spacey is enraged and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer or they re all dead flick feeling responsible for this sets off to look for help he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them he heads to the city the city being a house a few miles away where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs a ladybug denis leary who is spectacular a black widow bonnie hunt a caterpillar joe ranft a butterfly madeline kahn a rhinoceros beetle michael mcshane and a stick david hyde pierce also giving a hilarious performance flick doesn t know they re actors and they don t know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position the most obvious element of a bug s life is the quality of animation created by pixar the same people who brought us toy story a bug s life has some of the most amazing visuals i ve ever seen the bugs seem to inhabit a three dimensional space and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action this is a lush colorful world full of life and imagination the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives matches bottlecaps tin cans etc and make them active objects in the bugs world is innovative the film is also mercilessly exciting particularly in a superbly staged scene involving our heroes escape from a bird a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening but the makers of a bug s life know where the importance lies story and characters flick with solid voice work from foley is a great guy to lead the story but the real treat comes with the circus bugs they re such a likable group of characters the standouts are the stick hyde pierce is so good francis the ladybug and the big fat caterpillar all of these bugs have more than a token personality which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs and it also keeps the tear jerking scenes from seeming obligatory in my review of antz i said that the film is a clever cop out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant like existence in concept a bug s life is basically the same movie except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn t like about it with such strong work in both animation and script a bug s life is nothing but a joy to sit through it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie but a bug s life is so good that i m sure it will find its audience after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies it s downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty 
reflecting on bedazzled a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser one sinful thought remains in my mind if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley who portrays the fiery demon then use that pitchfork and point me the way with her pouty lips irresistible british accent and wild display of haute couture hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation it s practically impossible to turn this beelzu babe down her next target is elliot brendan fraser a tech support geek who is clumsy awkward and just too eager to please to aptly picture him you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring steve the copy guy who effortlessly irritated his co workers with his unpolished social skills eugene thus is loathed and feared by his co workers who do their best to stay out of his way yet beyond his annoying mannerisms he s a lovable oaf he wishes that he could get closer to allison frances o connor a co worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him however the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball s chance in hell dear god he prays i would give anything to have that girl in my life guess who then shows up she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul there s even an escape clause if elliot s wish doesn t go exactly the way he likes he need only beep her one guess as to what the three digit number is and he gets to start over the remainder of the film consists of elliot s various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth power fame and allison s love but when he makes sweeping statements such as i want to be very very powerful and very very rich and married to allison he ll soon learn that the devil is in the details for example and we ve seen this several times in the trailers he is granted his wish but finds out that he s a columbian drug lord and that allison while married to him has her eyes on someone else apparently the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short circuits his new life soon elliot wishes that he had never made that deal given the mischievous nature of the devil bedazzled has many amusing moments a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance he ably assumes various personas his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her hurley also heightens the humor quotient especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one it s clear that she s having a good time with it all yet while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story but that would be playing with fire what they ve got works so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is 
i m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks which is obviously the work of a deranged genius when tim burton s twisted alien invasion comedy really works it s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure and when it doesn t work it s just dull i m not even sure it works more often than it doesn t but where it counts that is when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come mars attacks is brilliant mars attacks is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the s and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer s independence day old alien invasion flicks disaster movies and big budget special effects extravaganzas but unlike independence day which was a painfully middle of the road appeal to the hearts minds and wallets of america mars attacks has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings mars attacks portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are the title sequence is just splendid an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman s thundering theremin driven score is absolutely jaw dropping it s so overwhelming that i swear to you i had trouble breathing the movie lays low for the next minutes we get a glimpse of the alien leader resplendent in a purple sequined cape when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world naturally the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming but mostly the first act is spent developing characters setting up mildly comic situations and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton it s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens because burton s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars anyone who comes to mars attacks expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed with few exceptions these characters are dispatched as the film progresses jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr strangelove s buck turgidson glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house s kennedy room a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big haired pointy breasted sexpot lisa marie the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood in an earlier scene it s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j fox is her newsman husband the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles they blew up congress and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace jim brown and tom jones are the film s vegas based heroes and director barbet schroeder reversal of fortune has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president also on hand and underutilized are annette bening pierce brosnan pam grier lukas haas and natalie portman the latter two also show up in woody allen s everyone says i love you the real stars of course are the computer generated martians and they re fantastic with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull faces round egg eyes with red pupils darting this way and that these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate joe dante s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory but burton s little monsters are more inventive the film s raison d etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault easter island is turned into a bowling alley and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans the sheer level of mayhem is staggering especially when the aliens make their first attack blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg rating it s earned the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day although mars attacks was in production long before that film s release cinematographer peter suschitzky who makes the most of wynn thomas s wildly imaginative production design thomas helped define the spike lee style actually took time off from his mars attacks regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg cronenberg s movie will almost certainly be more somber it won t be released in the u s until early next year but mars attacks is surely a similarly elegant nightmare this is not a nice movie and which studio executive was duped into giving burton million to make it by setting the film s final scenes in the nearly empty holocaust ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided burton s invasion epic suggests that the world we ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead the victims of his invasion are naive greedy or disastrously self absorbed and a good thing too since the movie s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish fulfillment fantasy the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers who triumph by determining that the alien invaders the ultimate elitists are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture ultimately this messy masterpiece is the year s funniest comedy and a weird winking affirmation of the power of the people 
very few people would be unaware of beavis butt head both created and narrated by mike judge they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind you may have seen them on their television program as they snigger and make lude remarks about women anything related to sex and the music film clips that they watch in beavis butt head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut to the delight of some and the deplore of others beavis butt head yes those are their real names are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones they live their lives in front of the television the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen this happens as they sleep and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone beavis even tries to use the remote though there is no television there the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television even at this point they have no idea what has happened they look around seeing all the evidence but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television before the movie i knew that they were stupid but i didn t realise just how stupid this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film eventually they realise that their television has been stolen so they leave their sofa to go search for a television luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room looking for a television where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife this man thinking that beavis butt head are the assigned killers tells them that they can have if they do his wife beavis butt head being the ignorant fools that they are think that he is offering them dollars to have sex with his good looking wife they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to do her to them this is the best day of their lives not only are they going to lose their virginity one of their lifelong aims but most importantly they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime and unbeknown to them are tracked across the country by the fbi oddly enough it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds they end up travelling right across america visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations their one time out in the big world away from their television they are completely oblivious to it at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra red operated urinals than with the geyser itself beavis butt head essentially have the journey of their lives they even get to meet the president but all they care about is getting their television back and losing their virginity this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny it s unbelievable just how stupid they are and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them the humour is certainly crude but then beavis butt head are just that crude lude and rude in the end you can t help but feel sorry for them a pair of anti social couch potatoes whose life is television in this respect and also with regard to authority such as the fbi mike judge is quite critical of amercian society if you are easily offended or find this pair particularly annoying steer clear otherwise it should keep you laughing the whole way through one note of warning don t take friends who like to imitate beavis butt head you ll never hear the end of it

if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories mostly in ironic way like grosse pointe blank and romy michelle s high school reunion some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones until that happens s would be remembered as the decade of greed when the revolutionary ideals of s turned into its cruel materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times one of such movies one that probably brings the essence of s to the screen is william friedkin s to live and die in l a the money isn t just the symbolic motive in the film it is the major elements of the plot rick masters willem dafoe is an ex convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l a being too intelligent to fall into police traps and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career masters managed to elude law for years and became well connected richard chance william l petersen is a secret service agent adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters however his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another finally he sets up a final sting but his superiors deny him the necessary money being frustrated and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich bill pankow he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway like french connection one of his previous masterpieces this friedkin s movie was inspired by real life gerrald petievich author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay spent many years working as a secret service agent that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency not much utilised by hollywood secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed the beginning scene where the movie s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn t seem like affliction in the reagan years on the contrary those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable compared with him and all the other side characters that want their piece of the action two heroes on the side of law seem like losers instead of being a classical good guy secret service agent richard chance portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement his sidekick who should serve as those better judgement is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end in such surroundings of moral decay the not so happy yet surprising ending doesn t seem out of line although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered the dark atmosphere of l a city of glamour and moral decay is nicely captured by william friedkin s directing skills the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro dean stockwell debra feuer darlanne fleugel and steve james gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his masterpiece great car chase that scene alone with lot of realism thrills and surprise twists is worth seeing the rest of the film the soundtrack provided by now almost forgotten band wang chung is also one of the more memorable of that decade in every case to live and die in l a is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it 
corey yuen s latest film hero is notable on two fronts first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production secondly the film is the re discovery of yuen biao the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai poverty and crime rule most of china a young man ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier tam see is the most powerful gangster in town having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams wing jing s to be a powerful and wealthy man and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love wing jing meets the singer at the club jessica hester and falls in love with her not realizing that she is the star attraction after stealing her picture from a display wing jing and his brother plot to impress her first they rob two foreigner s of their money and cloths and set up a midnight rendezvous unfortunately wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see s night club the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn jessica having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night gives up and returns home see decides to retire he gives the night club to wing jing as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder see arranges the trade and ask his lover valerie chow to take care of wing jing unfortunately she has sided with yeung seung the performances in the film are all top notch with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow the comic turn by yuen wah previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung s eastern condors is a marvelous surprise his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious the stand out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments with a stellar performance his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride his gangster is almost non violent in that he only retaliates never instigates violence but when the time comes to fight yuen biao has never looked better corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late the lighting cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch the action scenes do not disappoint either this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i ve seen in some time actually surpassing jackie chan s work in both rumble in the bronx and first strike the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed also noteworthy is the score for the film done in a marvelously lush orchestral style not representative of most hong kong fare i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both titanic and rosewood as best of the year all in all hero marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing 
in october of the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u spy plane fly overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles miles from the us president john kennedy bruce greenwood and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson s dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in thirteen days one of the highlights to come out of made for tv movies was a entry called missiles of october that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown that teleplay starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in now a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again the last time was for the taught spy thriller no way out to re enact the events of that most dangerous time in america s and the world s history taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p o donnell costner donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event once again as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war as o donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning he deals with the usual family crises and problems meanwhile a u spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment suddenly ken s routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat where thirteen days differs most from missiles of october is as expected in the scope of the project there is a big difference budget wise between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen it shows as the makers of thirteen days craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation the cast a true ensemble is led surprisingly by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner costner s o donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america s preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe but he knows that if the crisis comes to a head his family will be no more the meat of thirteen days is in the big picture not the microcosm of family though this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels the story does not just cover the face off between the world s two most powerful countries it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military cia the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army navy air force want to flex their might and invade cuba while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america s dignity and world leadership intact while the internal battle for power rages in the white house with air force chief curtis lemay kevin conway advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter the tension is palpable the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent instead he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president costner as ken o donnell is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor costner plays o donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast too standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un adlai stevenson who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy using old style video footage to good effect dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara kevin conway gives his general lemay the right bomb them to hell attitude also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who with his wingman takes on the dangerous mission of a low level photo recon into the heart of cuba bravely challenging kenny o donnell s admonition don get shot tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing it s an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right the special f x of the u sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year i give thirteen days an a 
tarzan chad z good g minutes hour minutes animated adventure drama starring the voices of tony goldwyn tarzan minnie driver jane porter lance henriksen kerchak brian blessed clayton written by tab murphy bob tzudiker noni white produced by bonnie arnold directed by chris buck kevin lima based on the story tarzan of the apes and characters created by edgar rice burroughs seen july at p m at crossgates cinemas guilderland ny theater by myself for free using my hoyts season pass theater rating very good sound picture and seats title tarzan beautiful to look at easy to follow review disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story the basic premise is the same as every other tarzan story a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding or even noticing that he s human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala voiced by glen close a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism her mate kerchak henriksen is a mean conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan s extended family he refuses to acknowledge tarzan voiced by alex d linz during the childhood scenes as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it s funny how the adults fail to comprehend this later as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full grown man voiced by goldwyn he is encounter by a party of three humans from england jane porter driver a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist her father prof archimedes q porter voiced by nigel hawthorne who is also a scientist and their slick and cunning yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton blessed it s easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn t seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children s enjoyment sure there s a lot of cliche stuff here like clayton s smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane the goofy supporting characters voiced by rosie o donnell in full brooklyn accent and wayne knight hello newman there s also a lot of fun action such as tarzan s swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks it s just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks those mcdonald s commercials really prove this point ultimately you get exactly out of tarzan what you expect and i mean that as a compliment so have high expectations pros animation and sound are a feast for the senses story is lighthearted breezy and not dumbed down no stupid sing along songs to get stuck in your head cons surprisingly violent should have been rated pg young children may not understand some of the more adult themes parents be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way running time is a bit short would you recommend this to friends not to my friends but to the movie going public i would score or with no rating 
when i first heard about scream in i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies from the master of the horror himself wes craven it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them by making the teenagers do what they know they re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them don t run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door never say i ll be right back etc when i first heard this description i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies was this wes craven s remedy from making real bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn it just seemed cheap to me then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes involving drew barrymore and a nail bitingly intense phone conversation completely changed my attitude scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick it s also a pretty scary movie if you ve seen a million of these kinds of films you know exactly what is going to happen this is part of the fun of watching scream the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent attractive teenagers to those who rarely see these types of movies scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film there s nothing wrong with that misjudgment though i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience the newbies to horror and the fanatics their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive from these varied reviews i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed in my opinion if it was not for the outstanding success of scream the low budget gem may alongside pulp fiction be the most influential film of the s this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs tingle or television programs such as dawson s creek but to others such as myself we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors screenwriters and directors scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly paced script by kevin williamson within the film are characters who tell other characters as well as the audience the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie mainly from the rants of randy jamie kennedy and stu matthew lillard we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well the virgin always survives have sex and you re dead meat not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self satisfaction in this case williamson finds these errors for the audience s satisfaction and amusement i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream which is a spoof of scary movies i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream s perfect subtlety however my last gut feeling about this stuff scream was dead wrong so who knows

as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens i have some idea of how ellie aroway jodie foster feels but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers i can t say that i do exactly her reason is that she needs solid proof there is no proof that god existed so therefor she does not believe ellie also believes in aliens and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist how can she say she doesn t believe in god because of the lack of proof and then say she believes in aliens which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite that s the catch when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them okay well they didn t really fax them ellie wants to be the one to go but because of her atheism she is denied the position how dumb is that she discovers the transmitions then she isn t allowed to go well because of a bomb and a psychopath jake busey she does end up going but not in the way that we would ve thought contact is based on a novel by carl sagan who died during the filmmaking it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the rd kind and will end up being the best film of the year its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some but will stimulate more i m glad at least one movie of the s can portray aliens in a psitive light rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body 
that thing you do r tom hanks s screenwriting and directorial debut that thing you do has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment fun lively and oh so nice it is the latter quality however that becomes a hindrance for this s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast that thing focuses on the wonders a teen rock band from erie pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in when they score a major dance hit called of course that thing you do the group s members are naturally a diverse group there s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy johnathon schaech girl crazy lenny steve zahn the lead guitarist a goofy geeky type known only as the bass player ethan embry and the film s center guy tom everett scott the drummer who has aspirations in jazz along for the wonders ride to success is jimmy s perpetually neglected galpal faye liv tyler hanks proves to be a capable writer director deftly recreating the innocent spirit of which hanks calls the last innocent year the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music which like the other recent period music film grace of my heart was expressly written for the film hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled it s still playing in my mind as i write this it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors eliciting charming likable work from the entire cast most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler who is remarkable in delivering the film s biggest and best dramatic moment the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early s they do not appear to be s grungers playacting retro yet for all the light frothy charms of that thing you do it s nearly nice to a fault while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting everyone is so happy basking in the glow of overnight success marvelling at it all except toward the end but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness ending on an appropriately feel good note there isn t much of an edge throughout that thing the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks s turn as the wonders manager and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it s bland but a little niceness goes a long way these days and there s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do it s just about impossible to hate it s an inoffensive enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming if not singing that thing you do quite possibly for days to paraphrase a passage from the song though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play that thing you do

there s a moment in schindler s list when a number of jews are trudging through snow clean and crisp dark edges and frost on the ground one girl waltzes through wearing a red dress that stings the eyes it is probably the finest moment through out the film when i first saw it i began to cry though i could not say why this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground so black and murky its almost pomegranate red at another time we follow a young boy as he runs searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet which is already occupied like so citizen kane fargo the godfather the godfather part ii greed many of the greatest american films schindler s list plays with the concepts of money power and soul but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing starkly emotional and brutally powerful schindler s list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings the following that it has gained is not suprising this is probably thus far the best film of the decade steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks jaws the indiana jones films and e t but it wasn t until that we saw what a brilliant man he can be the product of his genuis is really something to see it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you throughout we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads we watch oskar schindler liam neeson grow from an arrogant self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment the film requires much work and can be a harrowing experience go expecting a quick entertainment and you ll be bitterly dissapointed it does reward the patient viewer this is a mature spielberg and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece this eqsuisite beautiful film is a rare gem it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies it leaves one breathless uplifted and with much to think about afterwards you can reflect on individual images visions and people laconic removed schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all does much and leaves feeling as if he could should have done more then he did and was able to the change seems natural in the hands of a lesser filmmaker it would be crude and would cheat the audience instead we are told a tale told a story the film is punishing to watch yes but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle and a genuine masterpiece of a movie 
titantic writer and director james cameron s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed epic arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises whether the film is worth it as a business proposition it seems hard to see how it can ever break even but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful if you ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure think again the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers in either case it is filmmaking at its best when we entered the press screening my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long he said no but that the time would go by so fast she d never notice the length amazingly he was right titanic is one of the few long films that doesn t suffer because of it the lush picture filmed by russell carpenter in mm opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean fortune hunter brock lovett bill paxton leads the expedition looking for the world s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship known back then as the ship of dreams the necklace s hundred year old former owner rose dewitt bukater gloria stuart finds brock to tell him her story although almost all of the movie happens in flashback one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk using a computer simulation the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing after twenty minutes the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage in a classic movie theme the two parts of the ship first class and steerage third class exist in sharp contrast the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance cal hockley played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class even with her own promenade deck rose feels trapped on the ship what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes in contrast jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board after jack saves rose from committing suicide they start a brief but impassioned love affair never tawdry and rarely explicit their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma in so many ways small and large he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part when he confronts cal for example he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal s supercilious put downs kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose the chemistry between these two academy award nominees him for what s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility is nothing short of astonishing from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances if the film breaks after an hour and a half which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up you will still get one of the best films of the year peter lamont s sets are more than authentic one scene for example starts with the planning to retire captain played with insouciance by bernard hill having his tea on deck it then shifts to the ship s massive gears and then to the bright hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest at first since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull not some big gaping hole the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else what a lark we ve struck an iceberg now let s get back to our brandy and cigars the ship s musicians play like troopers through it all even after the panic sets in after all they see it as their duty to calm the passengers when the musicians are about to die they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together and they mean it their civility borders on insanity but it is touching nevertheless the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface there are more than enough characters to love and to hate and all of the casting is dead on special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable in titanic for which he created a nine tenths scale model of the entire ship cameron strove for accuracy at all costs the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two and the front section becomes vertical in the water people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately besides being romantic and dramatic the script includes liberal doses of humor from the many deliciously subtle verbal put downs to the physical comedy as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears it s good bye for a little while a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first this boat s for mommies and children there ll be a boat in a little while for daddies basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats it made the decks look too crowded otherwise perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim s on board the ship in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew no thanks the elegantly attired guggenheim replies we re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen but we would like a brandy titanic runs it is rated pg for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up 
naturally at the core of leon gast s when we were kings is the fight itself for what a fight it was thanks to the business savvy of don king an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman fans were treated to an round battle of endurance and strategy as much as brute strength that immediately entered boxing lore with the benefit of the first hand recollections of that old ex pug norman mailer this classic conflict is brought back to life but when we were kings tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary gast could hardly choose otherwise considering the vocal uncompromising politics of muhammad ali a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam ali opens gast s film with a forceful swipe at the united states when ali hollers damn america the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury no viet cong ever called me nigger ali reasons despite showcasing ali s proud unequivocal politics one of the most impressive features of when we were kings is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion listening to the film s numerous commentators it is clear that the geographic location for this rumble in the jungle is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage a coming home to africa foreman reminds us that africa is the cradle of civilisation fair enough but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu a brutal dictator while ali respects mobutu s ability to forge an independent african state mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well stocked torture chambers mailer s insights are lost on most of the film s commentators george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo rather than the newly christened zaire with admirable restraint gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire s squalid ruling elite mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power don king resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the messiah label attributed to him by a loyal disciple passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity understandably foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal he may be as one sympathiser notes blacker than ali but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali the thuggish mobutu and the tacky huckster don king africa zaire inspirational leader or vicious dictator all is left undifferentiated unconsidered in this optimistic celebration of black unity little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali s opponent wasn t white admittedly these issues are only hinted at rather than substantially explored the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves in their own time there is just too much to cover too much that is truly worthy of celebration for a protracted political analysis to be justified the excitement of james brown and b b king in concert for instance and of course there s always ali to consider as he shamelessly and hilariously hams it up in front of the camera shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another we gonna get it on coz we don t get along doubtlessly considering the multi faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover the makers of when we were kings faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues and what personalities best deserved their attention fortunately by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event 
i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set unless i m watching a movie i don t even have cable so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching the x files every sunday night it s the only show that s worth an hour of my time each week though since i don t watch reruns i m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether i am an avid fan of the show and have been for about three years now and i love gillian anderson the x files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off the film is like a two hour episode except that there are a lot more special effects the plot is thicker and the resolution is more satisfying this is a terrific film both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment i expected to like it more than any episode i ve seen and my expectations were met actually the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices but thankfully the makers managed to do it right when the finale ended the fbi branch known as the x files had been destroyed and our heroes mulder david duchovny and scully gillian anderson were left stripped of five years of hard work the film picks up soon after and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building but wait i m getting ahead of myself the film actually opens in the ice age about years prior during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien the alien s blood infects them fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer and the story jumps into modern times during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy and mulder and scully uncover the cover up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi soon they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens as i ve written before it s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this because everything needs to be a surprise fans of the show will know what to expect and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television there are some truly suspenseful and well created scenes here late in the film when they re in the alien spacecraft you ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema the special effects are very good and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic what i find interesting is that the x files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story our heroes are given subtle introductions we re not expected to know them on the outset and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn t required to understand the film there are of course little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans but i ll keep those as surprises it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly the series is strong for a lot of reasons it s original though it has many ties to the twilight zone and owes some homage to hitchcock and impressively eerie for a television show what really makes the series shine however are the actors duchovny has so much presence and is just a fun guy to watch he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man anderson is equally good and paralyzingly beautiful she s also a strong actress both performers have acted in little more than their series however though i think they ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon i enthusiastically recommend the x files both for fans and non fans is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry it s an intelligent film and takes you places that you might not have been or at least might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar the x files is impressive in concept as well fans of the series are likely to be highly critical and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move it s nice to see a risk pay off for a change actually it s nice to see a risk at all

this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city of james cameron s most heralded film titanic postponed from last summer with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history this was one film i was eager to preview so is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday my best guess it will sink though with many awards attatched to its hull no doubt titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date to see a ship fall apart with actual people running across the ship flying across the deck and falling to the water is just amazing to look at the effects are so stunningly realistic you would swear you were looking at actual footage but titanic is more than a disaster movie and that s where the problem lies there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise i ll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic we see actual footage of the sunken ship as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor bill paxton leads the expedition in search of sunken treasure what he finds instead leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage we meet rose kate winslet a young woman who comes from an upper class family rose is to be wed to a man she does not love we meet jack leonardo dicaprio a young man who comes from a poor financial background and wins a ticket aboard the titanic in a poker game the two meet under interesting circumstances and the love story begins add in a jealous fiance and a not so nice law officer played by david warner and you have a story that well gets a bit overplayed and oversappy i must add at this point that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates as a woman with new money who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship she is a pleasure to see on screen when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly into the film and eventually sinks you never really feel for any of these characters the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on the effects are tremendous from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room to a doomed ship cracking at the seams this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other we saw titanic in dolby digital surround and by far it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard when people are in the water at film s end you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles titanic runs far too long the movie is hours and minutes in length and while most of the first hours runs very fast and well paced the final minutes almost comes to a sudden stop and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends don t get me wrong about titanic it s not a bad as i am making it out to be it really is an exceptionaly well made film the costumes and sets are incredible and true to the time period the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form as we see actual pictures of the modern day wreckage transformed into the movie depiction this film will certainly win on effects costume set design and sound cameron has certainly made his best film to date unfortunately titanic is not a best picture candidate it just doesn t have a strong supporting story it s an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside it just doesn t have the emotional impact that i suspect mr cameron was shooting for i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews it is a film worth seeing i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office with its extreme running time and lack of enough robust to get substantial word of mouth i expect that it will do even better on home video this will certainly be the definitive ac movie for all you home theater enthusiasts titanic opens december th and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century fox i give titanic stars that s not bad ron epstein riginally posted in home theater forum 
i m an avid fan of the alien saga so this review is obviously a tad biased at least i admitted it of course that doesn t mean that i m gonna be giving this a four star review or something because alien resurrection the fourth film in the cool as hell series is not an absolutely amazing film much like the first two were however it s a very good film which never fails to entertain and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series in short i had a good time alien resurrection leaves off years after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genre s answer to job had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one of course the last one wasn t very great or anything i liked it though not as much as the first two and more importantly it wasn t financially successful a tawdry million bucks so back we are with ripley back as a clone which means we get another little satirical look at cloning not that that s a bad thing but it s becoming a cliche so she s cloned aboard an even more futuristic looking ship called the auriga by some doctors including the necessary bad government guy dr wren played by j e freeman as well as the little seen dr gediman played by none other than brad douriff mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her once you get past the fact that you can t figure out where they got her blood although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one the film s okay also on board are a band of mercenary pirates including michael wincott ron perlman kim flowers raymond cruz dominique pinon a jeunet sytable and winona ryder who plays analee call who turns out to have a bit of a secret i won t state it but unless you ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years you probably know all about it although it s nicely covered up there s a bit of a non sexual yet slightly homoerotic relationship between her and ripley but it s never really deepened enough oh well well as you might have guessed the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship including some shocks dan hedaya for instance who s death is comical yet sad since well he s dan hedaya and the remaining people about or are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth of course the plot is all balderdash and just an excuse for some good old alien brand fun the real focus of the series seems to be on style not really substance although there s always a bit of it most notably in aliens with the relationship between ripley and the little girl what s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach alien is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights aliens is a wild tense thriller alien is a bleak moody piece of semi noir alien is kind of like an off beat french film filled with lots of humor and cool scares jean pierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like das boot has with echoes hinting at a possible threat the chills in the film are really cool especially with the music which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes there s the most tense surgery scene since face off towards the beginning and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed one is the aforementioned surgery scene another one takes place between call and ripley which is just awesome the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense thrilling and jaw dropping scenes in the entire saga with a small allusion to jeunet s earlier film delicatessen and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool with a lovely allusion to goldfinger but the best scene in the entire film i m sure i m not the first to mention it takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her she has a an tatooed on her arm it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work as it never really deapens a lot of the characters however it does make us care about most of them so that when there s very little of them and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow we are pretty scared and yeah there are some very funny lines ripley who do i have to fuck to get off this boat johner well i can get you off but not this ship the acting is good all around with stand out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad in se en who performed the lust sin as an anxiety ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him winona ryder is good but not amazing like she usually is although she meshes well with the film of course and as usual sigourney weaver steals the show playing a variation on the ripley character less emotional and more rude and bitter she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable she s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for aliens but she s just awesome overall it s a thrilling entertaining film which doesn t really amaze like the first two but is much more amazing than the third installment the style is the best part of the film which isn t really a bad thing but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply but it s entertaining as hell and it s definitely fit for the alien series 
billy bob thornton who had a sudden rise to fame with s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer is becoming one of the most versatile and most accomplished american actors around at the moment as jacob the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton s hank thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers three men hank paxton jacob thornton and their friend lou brent briscoe stumble upon a plane wreck which upon closer inspection yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money jacob and lou want to pocket the cash hank the smarter and perhaps more naive of the three insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find eventually they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found and then split the money three ways things start going wrong though with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan disaster is sure to strike director sam raimi of the evil dead and darkman fame has made an excellent and thought provoking film worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come scott b smith s screenplay based on his novel which i haven t read is a fine example of escalating tension while it does remind one of danny boyle s shallow grave without the abundance of black humour it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality or the lack thereof found in a film with this subject matter alar kivilo s cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen s fargo with the bleak snowy landscape almost becoming another character danny elfman also does well with his moody finely written score if there s a flaw in the film it s that it goes on for just a little too long just when we think that they are about to wrap things up raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further while this isn t really a bad thing it did become a little frustrating at times this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand the performances are excellent with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene stealing turn as hank s scheming wife this is an excellent showcase for thornton s fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films fingers crossed though that this doesn t stop him from making another evil dead sequel 
with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the film noir genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control fargo miller s crossing blood simple and off the wall comedies centered around an eccentric scatter brained lead character raising arizona the hudsucker proxy their latest offering the big lebowski falls within the latter category though there are elements of the crime gone wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film the main difference however is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn t quite have the brains to get it all together the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who s wise to the world but he doesn t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling smoke pot and generally relax that main character is jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges introduced by the film s rambling narrator sam elliott as quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county the dude is unemployed needless to say and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends walter john goodman a borderline psychotic who s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody s cheating in a bowling match has the whole world gone crazy he shouts at a suspected cheater and donny steve buscemi who s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it donny you have no frame of reference here these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana john turturro who when we first meet him is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of hotel california and if it s possible seems to be even more of a head case than walter if that doesn t give you a good idea of this film s absurdist tone then perhaps this will the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude s rug they ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the big lebowski david huddleston and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug he doesn t have any luck but when bunny is apparently kidnapped the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the million ransom unfortunately walter gets involved and fouls up the drop off and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers the dude s car gets stolen along with the briefcase containing the money soon the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german nihilists who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn meanwhile the big lebowski s daughter maude julianne moore a feminist avant garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked wants to recover the money for her family the plot however is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival s run through the jungle and it fits the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully the film doesn t feature quite as many one liners and sight gags as the coens other comedies though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor particularly in the dude s dream sequences and acid flashbacks but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution there s also a noticeable but not too heavy handed thread of social commentary in the big lebowski which incidentally takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin at the beginning we see george bush on television making his this aggression will not stand speech the coens take aim at just about every elite l a subculture in the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bums will always lose shouts the big lebowski at one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and so on by the end we really start to admire the dude who almost certainly harbors the least aggression of anyone in this story his passive resistance emphasis on passive albeit to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters he also turns out to have a pretty well functioning brain in his head even if he doesn t like to use it very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he s getting a run around and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness but they don t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either i think that more than anything is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy it manages to approach characters like the dude and to some extent walter with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter brained audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un dynamic duo by the end of the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first it s good knowin he s out there the dude takin it easy posits the narrator towards the end i dare say that truer words have seldom been

though it is a fine piece of filmmaking there s something about elizabeth that left me a bit cold and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films particularly these days i just didn t care about the characters to me the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters be they imagined or historical as the case may be that the audience gives a hoot about and though elizabeth works well on many levels it falls short of excellence because of that very reason elizabeth takes place in england in as queen mary half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying before she dies though she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs as a result amidst much anger within the council elizabeth becomes the queen of england the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life much of the film deals with elizabeth s love for lord robert a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen there is much ado about her lack of a husband and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece as love interests are such a character driven element i didn t much care about the characters perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett and so i didn t have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen s most loyal advisor sir francis and attenborough as a well meaning but old fashioned lead council why then you must be asking do i recommend elizabeth simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin neither of whom i have heard create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches cellars and castles in th century europe each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown out white light from windows the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot indeed elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade ranking with kundun and braveheart watch also for the incredibly godfather esque mass murder scene it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films 
swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults steven spielberg may not have directed he only executive produced but his touch certainly is evident in this movie and he knows a money making winner when he sees one the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster big action funny comedy and the pacing of a rollercoaster hopkins plays don diego de la vega otherwise known as zorro a fighter for the people he is eventually captured by don rafael montero stuart wilson who also unintentionally kills his wife the film cuts to twenty years later where vega still wants to montero dead however he s far too old now and trains up thief alejandro murrieta banderas to become the new zorro banderas motive to avenge the death of his brother who was killed at the hands of captain love matthew letscher who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie with the scene set the movie goes on full blast with sword fights a plenty and witty one liners banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro s playing each other off with ease hopkins seems to come off a little better but banderas does some excellent work as the bad guys wilson and letscher seem one dimensional but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way the audience does hate them which can t be bad catherine zeta jones also pops up as hopkins daughter and although she provides little more than the usual female lead she delivers a charming but one note performance the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones there s a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed until jones clothes fall off all together the director fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye handles the film perfectly the action is well done and fast paced the comedy put across well the cast help a lot but the direction is still outstanding although the film is very long the plot keeps chugging along and there s barely a dull moment however the film is a little over indulgent and it could have been trimmed it manages to hold the attention thankfully and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel screenwriters john eskow ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script although they ve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action the plot itself is barely existent there s lots of little sub plots hanging around but there s nothing substantial to bring them all together the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to buy california using gold stolen from the guy he s buying the land off this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines however this doesn t seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film so the film is never quite sure where it s going in the end however zorro provides action and comedy in spades it suitable for everyone so put the guilt behind and put some more money into spielbergs bank account you won t regret it 
much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of lolita made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made over its use of pedophilia and as such it s important to address it straight forwardly before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years lying around in vaults san a distributor and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit when seeing this film after all the hoopla keeping in mind that there are people namely me who are fans of the novel who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation well you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution what s even worse is that seeing this lolita especially the first time and if you re familiar with anything lolita is admittingly very anticlimactic this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it it s really quite a film perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne although really look at its competition flashdance fatal attraction and indecent proposal at least besides jacob s ladder i ve seen this lolita twice the first time i wasn t so blown away it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting the second time not really thinking about how i ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre it really affected me emotionally the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one which is why it s such a good novel and why this is such a good film the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young year old girl named dolores a k a lolita is great because it s not trash for the perverted but because it s about human obsession with things that are out of one s reach its protagonist the comically named humbert humbert is not your average pedophile but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology something that will destroy us but that we can t live without these ideas are all worked into this film nicely but done in a way that is not heavy handed at all but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating the focus of this film and the reason for making it it seems was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images and scenes which are blatantly over stylized the tone of the book is a comical one but it s also a tragic one and humbert telling the story from his perspective blows every single thing out of perspective humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed we get a sense that perhaps it s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original year old love and allows himself to embody her as lolita he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions and by the end he has nothing but overly dramatic feelings for her the story recognizes the extreme of this almost out of a test seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions and perhaps bring them to peace the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey we can easily sympathize and even identify with him the opening and final images of the film are the same and who hasn t done a similar action that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen the first time being filmed in shock by stanley kubrick who couldn t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do but did the next best thing he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general in that film he used the traps of society as benefits the studio demanded the final scene that of a heinous murder come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile and when you see it it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession the censors wouldn t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the um relationship between humbert and lolita so kubrick decided to play it as comedy but still allow the tragedy to seep through looking at these two versions especially after reading the novel and we all know that when we ve read a novel and see a film adaptation we are bound to be angered by any size differences it s really impossible to compare them they both go for different things and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was and although it s true that several scenes are similar and are thus up for comparison overall it s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is and i won t say that here however this film is pretty amazing mostly because hey i loved the book and this film nearly reminded me of it it doesn t have nearly as much wit a couple comical scenes and even a lot of good chuckles but just not totally witty but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had some of that is in the casting of the two leads jeremy irons with his deep soft british voice and gentle look is an amazing humbert he s droll in a very unique way and well no one can look distraught the way he does he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience and when he looks at lolita with love and she looks at him with lust you know that he s her prisoner for as long as he lives and dominique swain who plays the title character is rather incredible she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction bratiness and self centeredness that marks the character it s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert she loves the attention and knows that she can have her way with him at any time when he denies her something she blackmails him effortlessly a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic and when he stands up to her she weeps and runs away leaving humbert to follow her there are two other minor characters in the film one who s a road block in the beginning and the other who s a reappearing threat to the relationship the former is charlotte lolita s mother played by melanie griffith in the book charlotte is a monster of a woman overbearing constantly scolding her child overly religious and ultimately selfish and she s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal at least in the beginning as played by shelly winters in the original she represented all these qualities as played by griffith here she s about half of them it s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first and even though griffith is not really bad persay she s nothing more the other is clare quilty the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita and succeeds but at a price langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original quilty was a comic character in the original a threat in the form of many forms popping in states of rambling german proning and eventually drunk langella takes the other route allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending the exact opposite of what we thought of him as you can see most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter stephen schiff but just parts of a whole new look at the novel at least cinema wise this version is beautiful and perpetually saddening the camera movements are stylized and each shot is breathtakingly rich the acting is for the most part wonderful and when we watch it we really get a sense that for humbert who is telling the story the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita more importantly it takes us right up the brink of emotion then jumps right over it by the end with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn t regret we feel that we all lose to something we can never have 
recently i read reviews of pleasantville one from entertainment weekly one from a newsgroup and two from different online resources each review compared this film to the truman show why the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television other than that the two movies are completely different from each other reviewers seem to love to pick one movie i e the truman show obsess over it and make it a guideline for other movies when pleasantville and edtv opened all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman the same goes for the thin red line as well when it opened in decemeber probably of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg s saving private ryan giving thin line no chance whatsoever critics loved private ryan so much that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards this is why i think pleasantville was underrated if the truman show had never been made pleasantville probably would have received better reviews done better at the box office and would be remembered after it s long been on the video store shelves sure it wasn t perfect and it wasn t very believeable but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history with the exception of don knotts as the annoying tv repairman the film is cast perfectly the ice storm s tobey maguire is david in real life he watches the old s sitcom pleasantville to escape from his feuding parents his twin sister jen reese witherspoon is a popular slut who steriotypically smokes and wears revealing clothes but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue those excessive s terms such as like whatever and cool make her sound like the total dimwit she s supposed to be the twins with a little help from a tv repairman casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo esque cast rather than a true acting one are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote their new parents played by william h macy and joan allen are perfect in every way their new names are bud and mary sue and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles the movie begins to take form it s just like watching a sitcom in itself you don t want it to end mary sue has sex with her date the school basketball champion when he tells all his friends about it they stop preforming perfectly at basketball and things start to take color soon we learn that these people don t know how to express true emotions and when they learn to do so they eventually turn into color this eventually sparks a racial war between the coloreds and the black whites entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has none of the depth poignance and brilliance of the truman show yes the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent but the racial setting intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom certainly classifies as deep considering it s what i least expected gary ross did not try to create an intelligent award masterpiece he just tries to convey moral messages within his work take for example big and dave his past films big be careful what you wish for dave good or bad lying is still lying did these movies win big awards no but they won the heart of millions pleasantville could have done that too if it wasn t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films pleasantville a ad am i almost lost my nose and i like it i like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown

in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies payback was better than conspiracy theory but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon in other words it s a decent couple of hours of entertainment but years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson s greatest hits payback probably won t be on it gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll mel s partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt so he puts a couple of bullets in mel leaving him for dead and goes on to pay off his creditors but mel isn t dead it would be a real short movie if he was and he certainly isn t happy to make matters worse he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters so mel goes after the mob to get it back payback is often a very violent film to its credit there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic but the director i m not sure which one more about that in a second made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films the film appears a bit disjointed in places which is understandable considering producer star gibson wasn t thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re shot when the director refused another one was brought in to do the re shoot so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end it s always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain unless that person has some redeeming qualities in this case gibson s character has few redeeming qualities but hey its mel so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role the audience would not be quite as responsive gibson is gibson whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer he does a good job he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast including maria bello as his love interest william devane and kris kristofferson as mod bosses the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn t have a real big part is james coburn as yet another mobster if i had one big disappointment in this film it would be that coburn didn t have a bigger role in the end payback is a fairly solid action thriller just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson s other work

mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv show er her mast famous episode love s labour lost dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood s big blockbuster movies so it s only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster and i have to say after a shaky beginning she does not disappoint peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists which is obviously nothing new the first half hour goes into detail way too much detail about how the weapons are stolen despite a few good images including a train collision and a very impressive explosion none of this was very coherent it s long and drawn out and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture it begins to take off george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two but that is dispensed with quickly the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm frustration determination and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self doubt this is when leder starts to show her true stuff she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city s crowded streets and a madman with a nuke walking among them mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero you re not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her george clooney is a real movie star many of you may have hated him as batman but this guy is for real he has a natural screen presence and an ingratiating personality he ll be around for a while dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker 
cinema has been around for about a hundred years now it s not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film but i d like to think that i m beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time recently i ve seen the films of hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius they are likely to be remembered for well quite a while i like this film too yes it s a disaster slash action movie true its budget is a lot more money than i ll ever see in my lifetime and there s not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money in fact i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film had they thought it would ve been more profitable i certainly don t care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such a skilled director that i doubt he d ever make a film that is difficult to sit through of course skillful direction doesn t complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together the story is well thought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters yes you read that right armageddon actually has characters you can care about if you don t like this film then you have a problem with the genre itself armageddon is as good as a film like this can be if you ve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film so it s up to the u s government to stop it why the u s is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated their plan to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate a nuclear warhead within the head driller is harry stamper bruce willis his group of men is a colorful bunch including a j ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi there s also an interesting triangle formed between a j harry and grace liv tyler who is harry s daughter a j and grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad isn t too happy with the situation it s absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you d like to call armageddon it s not about story it s about viscera and action and thrills a minute and all that stuff it s incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens but bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better i think most of the budget went to cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles take the spectacular opening scene for instance in which a meteor shower obliterates new york a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars the action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways i like his quick edit style because it s abrasive and exhausting to watch it s also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times but it s fun to be obnoxious sometimes the special effects in this film put every other blockbuster to shame deep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable special effects are very important in a film like this if they re not good then the image is not convincing and the film doesn t work everything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid the effects that don t look totally real are still a pleasure to behold and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice looking that it actually qualifies as art of course all of this would add up to little more than an above average light show if i didn t get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action the film is two and a half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots i won t suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions aren t put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way in fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and that s a lot more than i can say about deep impact which was banking on the feel good parts of its story bruce willis is terrific and i m glad to see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing tyler and affleck are great together and make a convincing couple all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level patton who is a magnificent actor thankfully is not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his ex wife and son is very moving the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays a crazy russian astronaut is nifty and keeps the film lively and funny i wasn t challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon and i don t mind too much but the film doesn t insult my intelligence it s pitched perfectly to entertain which is what all it really wants to do it s not mindless and escapist but well crafted cinema it might have been created for the wrong reasons but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good in spite of the producers and the budget i m not saying that films like this are risky moves what i am saying is that armageddon is a big loud expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms 
when i was asked to see this movie with a friend my initial reaction was not hugh grant i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker i just could not picture him in any romantic lead what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script this writer richard curtis whose exceptional first work four weddings and funeral shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy with splashes of drama thrown in between hugh and his hair is almost identical to the character that made him famous in four weddings he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck unfortunately he is type cast in this role but fortunately it works well for him in this movie if only he would dither a little less julia knows this role well the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love there are moments in this movie that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful but to have no one to share it with the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice 
every year hollywood crowns a new it boy a young actor pegged for major movie stardom inheriting the mantle from last year s winner matthew mcconaughey is matt damon and like mcconaughey he proves to be more than just a fresh young face as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release john grisham s the rainmaker and good will hunting damon has his first major starring role a la mcconaughey in a john grisham adaptation in this case francis ford coppola s take on the rainmaker damon plays wet behind the ears attorney rudy baylor who immediately after passing the bar exam finds himself representing the mother mary kay place of a terminally ill young man john whitworth in a big league suit against a negligent insurance company while rudy s and the film s main concern is this case he also finds time to protect a young wife claire danes from her abusive husband melrose placer andrew shue in a mercifully brief role written for the screen and directed by coppola the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously coppola s most notable and effective contribution to the tried and true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself which largely comes in the presence of danny devito as rudy s unlicensed co counsel and golden globe nominee jon voight as the insurance company s hotshot attorney the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous but danes is as superb as always then of course there is damon who nicely juggles the weighty the insurance case the spousal abuse and the humorous rudy s often comical naivete requirements of his role without missing a beat as good as he is in the rainmaker damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself damon plays the title character will hunting a troubled young construction worker janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction an mit math professor stellan skarsgard taps his old college friend community college psychologist sean mcguire robin williams to counsel the abrasive standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life good will hunting is the touchy feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon s intelligent script touches even though no one and if so very few people can directly relate to will s burden of superhuman intelligence the insecurities he suffers are universal the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors williams delivers a nice dramatic turn affleck a hot up and coming actor himself chasing amy turns up in a warm and charming performance as will s best friend and the ever appealing minnie driver shines as will s harvard schooled love interest the clear standout in the cast though is damon who bravely does not soften will s prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard not to care for him so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine but based on his impressive work in john grisham s the rainmaker and especially good will hunting it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come 
expectation rating a bit worse than expected mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull roger ebert gave it a four star review and while he is a critic that uses the full scale and i often agree such as dark city being the best film of he must have seen a better film i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter the landscape is snowy and cold and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner which also reminds me of fargo which i loathed one can almost sense the cold but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead instead raimi has made a more constrained film which probably is for the better this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots the movie also reminded me of affliction as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father and they see a chance for such a dream to come true this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field where an airplane has crash landed in the plane three men find the american dream in a gym bag affliction too was set in a snowy landscape it really seems very simple just hold on to the money until spring and if no one claims it they ll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true but the snow melts and so might several of the character s hopes as in return to paradise some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish the movie s biggest strength is that it fact makes sense i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story for example clear and present danger the biggest problem seems to over familiarization with the story the writer perhaps feels that he doesn t have to present scenes that are clear to him but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan even though the screenplay is by the book s author the movie is always clear on where it s going and always makes sense i m sue a lot was cut but really i can t remember what even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included the man only comes in on mondays but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many turns out well see the movie one should be warned against seeing the trailer it reveals several scenes from the ending moments which yes like in the book it is a downer several plot developments and much of the beginning but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer so if you re lucky you ll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie 
only a year after the initial release of scream the horror send up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre the inevitable sequel scream has arrived in our theaters while the tongue in cheek parodic element is still noticeable in this film it s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story the first film while often violent and gruesome was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant the premise of scream is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called stab based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers courtney cox about the events in scream is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy its conclusion in which a bleeding wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it s a publicity stunt is more surreal and disturbing than anything else the satire in scream thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general although resident horror film geek randy jamie kennedy is back with fresh dialogue about sequels and interestingly enough how they are usually inferior to their predecessors the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well everything from friends and saved by the bell to showgirls and terminator is referenced here horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning and there aren t any wes carpenter jokes this time more importantly this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from scream in fact the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety and one man seems willing to save the heroine s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show understandably scream does not go so far as to actually blame the movies but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted couple that with the fact that several of the characters most notably the lead character sidney prescott neve campbell are fairly well developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine chilling suspense and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right we don t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered and in one case a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner while i have not seen any of his other work it s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated slasher film director as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing unfortunately scream occasionally reverts to the time honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window for example several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that s he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction as for the question of whether or not scream is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor well it s hard to say i gave the first scream stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light hearted send up scream bounces all over the place stylistically but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment i m not sure which is the better movie but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing sequels however much randy might argue do not necessarily suck 
for more than a decade anjelica huston has been one of america s finest actresses in her directorial debut bastard out of carolina based upon dorothy allison s largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth in post world war ii south carolina through voice over narration done by laura dern we find that she nearly didn t survive birth as her single mother anney played by jennifer jason leigh was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident that s just the beginning of her troubles bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come anney meets and weds lyle a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident anney s brother earle played by michael rooker introduces her to glen played by ron eldard a co worker at the mill glen the black sheep of a wealthy family when are you gonna make your daddy proud i ll tell you when never he s told and filled with bitterness courts anney and eventually wins her despite warnings of a violent temper when anney miscarries with his much prized baby boy glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone beating and abusing her while the love dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment while set several decades ago this story remains completely relevant in today s society where abused wives return to their husbands and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other the real star of this domestic drama is not top billed jennifer jason leigh but child actress jena malone who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance her work is of award calibre and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged kirsten dunst tina majorino anna paquin natalie portman christina ricci elijah wood malone s performance stands up well leigh s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine although she s not really given much to do and ron eldard work is very solid skillfully manouvering his character s moods in and out of explosive rage one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure cooker ticking away of the supporting cast special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker s performance there s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms to the familiar sight of a dried up uptight wise old granny played by grace zabriskie sitting on the porch rocking chair to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance still it cannot be denied that anne meredith s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power huston s direction of the film is surehanded and impressive giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast particularly the young malone her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard hitting emotional rather than graphic manner and are very effective huston s talent with camera positioning is wonderful from a visually striking shot done through a fan to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile the film has the toned down feel of a television production bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing 
seen september at p m at rotterdam square mall cinema theater with chris wessell for free using my sony loews critic s pass theater rating good seats average sound picture unstable rounders is exactly the kind of movie parents don t want their kids to see it s not that it s a drunken orgy of sex and violence but because it s a film that flat out says you can make a career out of gambling and to take make things worse it proves this through its original fascinating story there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life this film starts off in the tradiational noir style introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing matt damon stars as mike mcdermott a something law student in present day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played damon narrates throughout the film but the entire opening scene is voiced over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting mike s about to go up against teddy kgb malkovich a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer but then again he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense the look in his eyes his slow movements his intricate mannerisms all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly groomed features but his narration is what brings it all together he never sounds like he s reading from a script nor that he s trying to embellish anything it just comes natural to him the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood from the smell of the air to the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards and all without sounding remotely trite immediately we get the sense that poker isn t for gamblers but for near geniuses with nerves of steel the game is a quiet war with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it comes to the game of poker all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit we learn only a little about mike both past and present presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues with over his gambling they go through a few break up make up cycles until mike s childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison it s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does technically the plot isn t unlike many children s sitcoms in which the good kid s bad friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives but both share a passion for out thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always takes the cards he s dealt and works with them sometimes they pay off i e his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other times they don t i e the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping on a single hand once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places from socialites mansions to taking the tourists at atlantic city to outwitting the gangsters that control it all everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything s a battle against the cards destiny deals one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge martin landou in a perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time matt s good at gambling but he s also got potential to be a great lawyer he could go professional as either but with one he could lose everything or win big but with the other there s stability but not much risk involved can someone who s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker playing then the ending is our test everything is told from mike s perspective but we re finally able to recognize some things on our own this makes the final against all odds showdown seem like just that it works just like the game it revolves around showing us some of the cards but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequences thereof what separates rounders from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end 
if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child would you do it gattaca is a film which presents a future where society has answered yes to this question but then ponders if this was actually the right decision gattaca came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature the lovable dolly the sheep and with this in mind the film only becomes more frightening the way the realm of genetics is heading it may only take a couple decades until the future gattaca presents becomes true contrary to the misleading trailers gattaca is not a sci fi thriller in the way that there s lots of murder hitchcockian suspense and chase scenes this is a quiet sad film about intelligent theories in fact the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley the latter who s novel brave new world featured genetically engineered children it s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia which is exactly what gattaca presents and the main reason i dug it so much the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ethan hawke a man with high hopes but a chance of heart problems and a prospected life span of around years as a child he was put down because of the threats of genetics while his younger genetically perfect brother anton loren dean was promised whatever his heart desired vincent yearns to be an astronaut but when he gets a job at a giant space company it s as a janitor ernest borgnine plays his boss but one day he finds out that it s probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist or something german wings tony shalhoub who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in men in black a life less ordinary who s client is a genetically perfect man jerome morrow jude law who has unfortunately been crippled fortunately though there s no record of the accident and he s willing to give someone else his life since vincent looks a bit like him after a couple alterations some minor some really major he has donned the life of jerome and is doing his job there he meets a genetically imperfect woman irene uma thurman who s genetically perfect in real life anyway hee hee and the two begin a kind of relationship albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man s stats are however a murder of a high level worker at his office is killed and one of vincent jerome s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi wily inspector hugo alan arkin and none other than vincent s long lost brother anton who hasn t seen him since they were teenagers we know vincent jerome didn t do it but with his older picture being posted everywhere not only vincent jerome s in trouble but also the real jerome who s as much in it as he is however there isn t many big suspense set pieces which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in the film would lose it s message and descend into just being a sci fi thriller a la william gibson the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening there are no big distractions from the point of the film much to the dismay of commercial audiences what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created irene has no real spunk in her life and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man claiming that his accident was really no accident what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that and the ending is shocking as it s a definite work of dystopian propaganda but doesn t have the down ending of other works of this kind the production design of this film is probably the best i ve seen this year it s stunning very pleasing to the eye but still very cold since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery and the sequence of all the high level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam esque feel to it showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie like life the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy the acting from everyone is great with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway interesting pointless fact uma and ethan started dating after this film and currently she is pregnant with his child but the best performance belongs to jude law who steals every scene he s in and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i m not sure of gattaca warns us not to go any farther chiefly because we ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are and when i see a possible future featuring a fingered piano player well folks that just creeps me out 
now that boogie nights has made disco respectable again well fashionable at least we shouldn t be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman s the last days of disco stillman who made metropolitan and barcelona using some of the same actors uses disco s final hours to highlight what is another conversation heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director the young upwardly mobile professional don t call them yuppies men and women of the last days of disco frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire amy grant and andrea true connection here they talk and talk and talk intellectualizing about such things as dating success and being liked accepted and admired if talk is cheap the last days of disco must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie harvard educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit perception and style including at one point a riotously inventive deconstruction of the lady and the tramp na ve alice chlo sevigny and sophisticated charlotte kate beckinsale are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house charlotte is confident and outspoken perhaps a little too outspoken alice is shy and introverted like a kindergarten teacher the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot looking good and looking for excitement and that ms beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor here they meet or re meet a variety of eligible men many of whom they knew in college des played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman is one of the club s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back des has reached a crisis point in his life he just found out last wednesday in fact that he s gay whether it s true or not it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend jennifer beals in a small but soul baring turn charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth jimmy mackenzie astin is the advertising exec who by the end of the picture winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain visions of barcelona josh matt keeslar is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say just once book this clown and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice s revolving suitors the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book in fact the entire ensemble is appealing in that well spoken stillman way while the eschewing of ferocious pairing is a favored topic of conversation in the film the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love lust and trouble with each other in an emotional merry go round that cleverly develops its characters through the preferred dynamics of social group interaction more mature than stillman s previous two films the last days of disco is as consistently droll as it is stimulating it s a movie you should definitely get on down to 
as i write the review for the new hanks ryan romantic comedy you ve got mail i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet i am also aware that i have just spent the last hours watching the world s biggest paid commercial for america online and i wonder is that so bad well the commercial part is as for the movie well as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan i think i ll be okay to paraphrase james berardinelli whose reviews i admire very much tom hanks and meg ryan can act they are both wonderful but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan and his glorious triumph in philadelphia i like him best when he s suitably obnoxious tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he s going to get the girl the only question is how meg ryan america s high school sweetheart can act she s had a handful of memorable performances including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally i must not mention what she does due to the well um you get the idea and if you don t get the movie fantastic but i like her best when she s well perky she is so adorably perky cute that together with hanks they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples but i don t really know all i know is that i just like them both they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that s really hard to resist and i m not going to even try they re just really really cute sweet and charming hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle here the setup is a little different kathleen kelly ryan owns a small children s bookstore which her mother founded years ago and passed down to her she is successful beautiful and dates a well known columnist with very radical idea kinnear she is also having an affair of sorts you see kathleen with the handle shopgirl is secretly emailing ny they have a strictly un detailed relationship there are no specifics and they have no idea who each other is ny happens to be joe fox hanks a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega bookstores run by his father coleman fox books has decided to open a store on the west side right across from a little children s bookseller named shop around the corner run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly every morning these two email each other silly and every day they fight to the death it s a charming premise and one that works nicely balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have it also has the great sense of being a classic romance there is no let s have sex tonight mantra if you ll excuse my bluntness this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love hmm well the movie goes through twists and turns having some sad moments and happy ones until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan hook up to use modern terminology and kiss their way into happiness you know it s going to happen the question is now thankfully ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey kinnear chappelle and a host of others including a great scene involving brothers aunts and two sweet kids it s all cute and wonderful and for all of the idealism it makes me feel good hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is he is i believe america s greatest actor does he show it here nah but he s still tom hanks and she s still meg ryan which is what this movie boils down to it s pure confection all the bits about the godfather the jokes the superb script it s all really sweet there are some immense flaws like pacing the last third of the movie really doesn t work as well as i would have liked and for a romantic comedy it s slow once hanks knows the secret it gets really slow i even looked at my watch a couple times to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for so that i could get home at a reasonable hour the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated e mail when my kids are my age i don t know what we ll be using but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history they just work together and it s nice to see it gives you well a smile the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was i ve always believed that movies are very powerful very powerful indeed you see mankind has three abilities he needs to survive the ability to think entertain and procreate movies can definitely do the first two and as for the third well i d rather not think about that i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint and that films that entertained you were good because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had hanks was the driving force behind one of the year s best films in saving private ryan which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world he s also half of the glue behind the year s best example of pure entertainment tom hanks and meg ryan are magical as is this movie it s a sweet lovely affair with a technology twist it may be a long commercial but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face 
 when you get out of jail you can kill him starring ashley judd tommy lee jones bruce greenwood rated r double jeopardy is a lurid prepostrous thriller that s also one of the year s most enjoyable it s an uncompromisingly brutal cheerfully anarchic hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it there is not a moment here when the events on screen don t have a direct bearing on the plot once the film gets going it never stops it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that s probably a correct assessment of the plot but the film itself has little in common with the andrew davis harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones not even bothering with character introduction director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get go and never finds the brake we meet rather hastily libby and nick parsons ashley judd and bruce greenwood respectively a seemingly happy married couple with a son matty age they go out on a sailboat one night and after a period of some rockin sex they go to sleep libby hears a strange noise wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood she follows a red trail to the upper deck where she finds a knife and out of astonishment picks it up at that convenient moment the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested her lawyer a friend puts up a defense in court but though we know she is innocent the evidence against her is too compelling her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison once in prison she makes a phone call to her friend her friend gives her son the phone nick walks in the room little matty screams daddy the phone goes dead libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn t even dead she gets some advice from a prisoner former lawyer who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband they can t convict her of the same crime again meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can t touch her after a weirdly short amount of time she gets out of parole she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees under the command of parole officer travis lehman tommy lee jones she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son s adopter double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime same time same place same circumstances it s not like it matters this is a rollickingly good thriller intense exciting fast and furious it s silly alright but this is the kind of film you just don t question in some films plausibility is everything double jeopardy however is not concerned with making sense its sole purpose is to entertain and it does judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role this is her breakout box office performance and she is terrific she brings some emotion to what could have been a one dimensional role giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive but the movie makes good use of his stone faced wit thankfully too double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film s story this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system it s great to see a movie that doesn t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure double jeopardy is really good but it isn t the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards it s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off otherwise your brain will be busy ruining your experience this is a thriller that isn t concerned with being smart or plausible instead it diverts all attention to the action which this year is second to none 
the second jackal based film to come out in the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo s own alma matter concordia university in montreal canada the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal but does not pretend to be factual plot naval officer ramirez quinn gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal in order to put an end to the actual militant s radical activities he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this assignment and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism intrigue and double personality syndrome which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states critique great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two hour runtime admittedly i wasn t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film and didn t expect much from this movie beforehand but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line the first hour is mostly just a build up of things to come and does offer a great characterization of the jackal but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal but didn t offer anything extraordinary in my opinion sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they ve played in both of their respective careers of late but nonetheless appeared to relish the cold heartedness of their chosen characters i didn t like performance put forth from quinn s wife in this flick but then again she doesn t show up in most of the film so that wasn t so bad i did however enjoy director duguay s interesting style and cinematic vision this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer i thought that was neat having said that i didn t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the fake jackal met with the real jackal s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part but all in all not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre little known facts ben kingsley s real name is krishna banji he stands was born in scarborough england and won the best actor honor in s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal canada joblo s haven of restfulness donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland is canadian and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal 
after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles as a master would teach an eager apprentice you caress the noodles with the chopsticks he says then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying see you soon of course it s meant to be a parody but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat not something you like not something you enjoy but rather something you experience experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts trust me you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point juzo itami s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western set in modern day japan a stranger goro tsutomu yamazaki comes into town and finds tampopo nobuko miyamoto the proprietor of a small hole in the wall noodle shop trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman pisken rikiya yasuoka goro to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen emerging bloodied but victorious goro finds that tampopo s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away just to eat a bowl of her ramen the problem is her fare is something less than popular and less than appetizing however goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert enlist the aid of a wealthy patron and make friends with the former enemy this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems take for example when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner the price is too high but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum tampopo meets him at his store late at night and he leads her to a back room she protests thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives but he insists just when she is about to bolt for the exit he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience this scene while comical is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation then of relief and discovery there s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who despite their economic trappings are all gourmets and master sommeliers we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet the scene is meant to bring a laugh but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor food is something which everyone has in common and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people s lives a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor surrounded by her children she is obviously in her last hours of life her husband comes home and seeing her worsened condition demands that she get up and make dinner the viewer knows the husband s intention is not to be mean he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this in a near miracle the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal then brings it to her awaiting family as the family eats she looks on them and smiles preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her and for a brief moment she too enjoys the normalcy then she falls over dead for a moment the family is stunned but then the father yells at the children keep eating this is the last meal your mother ever made crying as they do so the family finishes the meal the scene is comical awkward moving and beautiful by including the vignettes itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film but surprisingly they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline instead they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble because the film parodies a western the construction of the plot is fairly predictable but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the good guys come together for the final showdown in this case the showdown is against the ramen if they eat tampopo s ramen soup and all tampopo knows she has succeeded it s pretty obvious what the outcome will be but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life you can afford to cut it a little slack 
studio expectations must not have been high for great expectations the film s release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in it s actually a smart move because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn t quite oscar fodder it is strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year great expectations also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann s william shakespeare s romeo juliet great expectations opens somewhere in s florida the original story is set in th century england as eight year old finn jeremy james kissner meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future there s icy year old estella raquel beaudene a pseudo playmate of finn s ms dinsmoor anne bancroft estella s auntie who s quite off kilter over a past romance that never took off and a mysterious prisoner robert de niro whom finn saves the life of finn who lives with his sister s affable boyfriend lone star s chris cooper fancies himself an aspiring artist and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms dinsmoor s lipstick eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion flash forward into the s after a brief stop in the s and finn now played by ethan hawke despondent over a strange hot and cold relationship with the elusive estella gwyneth paltrow receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor it s enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art there finn seems to gain everything he could ever want wealth prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world when estella resurfaces albeit with an aloof fianc hank azaria finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction but she s not the only ghost from finn s past that s going to be paying him a visit comparisons with the afore mentioned romeo juliet seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting great expectations is a much better venture though because it treats its source with even handed respect where romeo was never quite sure whether to be a spoof a homage or both the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki s sexy cinematography notably he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious erotic charge that s steamier than the film s surprisingly muted love scenes the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on screen action beautifully especially new songs by tori amos mono and duncan sheik acting credits are first rate often hiding the screenplay s occasional slip ups hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man something we also learned from gattaca and his finn is quite a likeable guy paltrow s estella on the other hand is rather underdeveloped while the actress is at her icily seductive best we re not told very much about her character and as a result it s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level but oh what a physical level sometimes we root for finn although we don t quite understand why she s fueling his fire robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft a macabre throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous alfonso cuaron s visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie s climax another problem is predictability you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren t familiar with the story despite its script flaws though great expectations is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy and frankly it s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality perhaps that renovated release date awfully close to valentine s day will end up helping great expectations seemingly average box office chances after all 
 a breed apart casts rutger hauer as a crazy bird loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner a bit hard to swallow that s only the first of many improbabilities in this film hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector turner is the woman caught between the two men a breed apart isn t a bad movie exactly indeed i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters even though their goals couldn t be more different the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies for example early on in the film hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at his birds later on the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people and hauer kills a few of them i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn t get involved at that point another problem is the silly love triangle that develops i didn t care one way or the other who ended up with turner i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions however despite this uninteresting sub plot turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there s more to life than money and birds as for hauer he s an actor i ve always admired he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters and this one is no exception he s frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse wearing pirate s clothing and holstering a cross bow despite all his eccentric mannerisms though hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through for example there s a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early he comes off as crazy loner in that scene but a few minutes later he is apologizing to turner and we believe his intentions soon after we find out he s a vietnam vet and his actions become fairly clear to us a breed apart isn t a great movie by any means but it does contain good performances by all three leads and it s worth seeing for that reason alone

it s a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn t need violence to be good or worth watching all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo nuclear war and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon a computer whiz kid david is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game he wants to be the first to play it instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad with the help of jennifer a girl in his biology class he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr war operation plan response a top notch computer at the time but now hardly faster than my own computer i remember being and watching this at the cinema it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn t changed of course a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in i wouldn t be surprised if this gave people nightmares i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers although her interest in david remains a mystery but the rest of the actors are by no fault of their own restricted by the script to play one dimensional grownups david s parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the s movies like secret admirer porky s or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr strangelove if for no other reason you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on far from any k modem my guess is that it s some kind of bps modem the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights just like those you see on star trek or any old sf movie but it s hardly impressing compared with what you can get today what are the lessons we can learn from wargames make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers thank you whoever it was for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers 
for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend there are certain rules that he needs to follow firstly fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship secondly buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes thirdly find the perfect moment and location to propose finally the groom wannabe should probably get her parent s blessing of these four the last one can be a nightmare meeting parents is a rite of passage fraught with unexpected questions bouts of nervousness the reality of being disliked and the inability to make a positive impression if you re lucky things will go smoothly but if you re greg focker ben stiller everything will go wrong and with a name like that how could it not when greg first meets his fianc e s father jack byrnes the grimacing robert deniro greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive when he tells jack that he s a male nurse the incorrigible dad shoots back not many men in your profession huh greg it s definitely not a good start but greg is determined to win him over and it s this desire that fuels the movie he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner it doesn t matter that he s jewish if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace then that s what he s going to gamely do oh god you re such a good god he moons his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle but when jack gives him the deniro squint that familiar unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility it s pretty hard not to grin things get progressively worse for greg and that s too bad because he s a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart eventually he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up committing a host of gaffes that embarrass humiliate or injure other people it s a never ending ordeal of missteps miscues and mistakes he buys some champagne but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances he tries to find jack s missing cat but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble and there are several other episodes each one trumping the next in outrageousness the more our well meaning beau screwed up the more the audience groaned in sympathy we liked greg and we liked this movie meet the parents is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments just sit back and watch greg get into trouble no matter what the situation whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house things will horribly go wrong we laugh at greg s expense but love often makes a person do dumb things and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool deniro is also affable tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside their tug of war is often funny the slapstick is elaborate and there are several topical throwaway gags mostly targeted at the airline industry to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in laws from hell

i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video it really scared me and i didn t want to go see it however after i heard about how wonderful it was i wanted to see it i didn t get a chance to do so until now the film disney s th animated feature opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale a long time ago in the land of prydain there was a king so evil that his spirit was captured in the cauldron it has been hidden for centuries and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors and with them rule the world and destroy it then we meet a farmer wizard dallben and his young apprentice taran taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a pig keeper they have a pig named hen wen one day as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath the pig goes crazy and dallben then realizes after watching hen wen s thoughts through a bucket of water that taran must hide hen wen in the forest an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron and only hen wen has the power to show its location taran leads hen wen into the forest but of course he loses her and tries to go find her along the way he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi who desires munchings and crunchings much to his dismay besides he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen when he hears hen wen s squeal from far away though he races to her rescue only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king s castle from far away taran climbs the castle walls and brings himself into the castle where he attempts to rescue hen wen he manages to do so but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon there he meets princess eilonwy and her magic bauble another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron and the two escape through the deep castle walls along the way taran finds a sword in a burial chamber and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie the three manage to escape the horned king s castle but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic as they rest in the forest gurgi reappears claiming to have found hen wen s trail he leads taran eilonwy and fflewdurr by way of pig tracks to a whirlpool suddenly they all get sucked under and they meet the fairy like fairfolk taran is reunited with hen wen and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage it turns out to be no ordinary cottage three comically strange witches inhabit the place when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron they agree to let him have it in exchange for his sword taran agrees much to eilonwy s horror but at least they get the black cauldron but the cauldron can t be destroyed only its evil powers can be stopped the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will never to return alive things take a turn for the worse when the horned king s henchmen capture taran eilonwy and fflewdurr along with the black cauldron and lead them back to the castle taran eilonwy and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors this is the most horrifying scene in the film because here a dead army comes alive just when all seems lost though gurgi reappears and rescues taran eilonwy and fflewdurr taran is about to jump into the black cauldron but gurgi stops him not wanting him to throw his life away gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron and the deathless warriors decay taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi but he is forced to do battle against the horned king he kicks the horned king away who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron where its powers immediately destroy him completely taran eilonwy and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king s castle just as it self destructs the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away but fflewdurr stops them saying that they never give anything away they bargain in response to this the witches offer taran his sword back but taran instead has a new trade the cauldron for gurgi the trade is made gurgi s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group as taran cradles him in his arms though gurgi stirs he is not dead after all the happy group then returns home where hen wen brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past dallben and even doli await their triumphant return as spectacular as it sounds the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron a sword and sorcery tale for the studio bringing this book to the screen was the studio s fondest dream miller who entitled himself as the executive producer promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron by this time things had gone really rocky for the animation department many of the studio s old men had retired or died therefore the animators suffered a hard time making this film originally budgeted at million the costs raised to million because of constant changes on everything and when it was finally released on june the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics but somehow the film flopped the film was rated pg and the film although disneyfied from lloyd alexander s chronicles of prydain which is what this film is based on was much more scarier and darker than disney s other previous efforts such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it in addition other critics rejected it for having no heart and unmemorable compared to other disney animated features but whatever the real reason the black cauldron was a financial disaster grossing only million the failure of the film grounded the studio s animation department and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio s reputation the next two disney animated features the great mouse detective and oliver and company although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron didn t do much better although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features as for the black cauldron it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron finally the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released because of all this you might ask yourself was the black cauldron really such a bad movie the people who had seen the film didn t think so in fact many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film but of course they denied it for a while it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video until september disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc including me and for those who hadn t seen the film yet i am included here they got quite a treat but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors about seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating in the uk the u rating means universal suitable for all ages kinda like their own version of g somewhere online a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said bring back the black cauldron and because of that disney finally decided to release the video to the united states before that time rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed like the uk video so that it would get a g rating and that they would add in songs those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron would be released in its pg rated version even still when it was finally released to the us some reaction was mixed some felt that it was indeed cut but some felt that it wasn t but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available as for myself when i saw the movie for the first time on converted ntsc video i didn t expect much at all in fact i had heard so many mediocre things about it that i didn t think the film would ever be such a good film much to my surprise when i saw the first few minutes of the film i was asking myself this is the same film everyone saw the one that flopped at the box office the one that critics and filmgoers alike called a bad movie this doesn t seem like all of the above instead it s a classic in its own right the film has a wonderful cast of characters there s taran grant bardsley an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig keeper the story s hero the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all but the opposite is true he is brave loyal and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on there s a likeable character here not that he s the only likeable character in the film there s gurgi john biner a lovable little uh thing who remains loyal to taran even though they don t quite hit it off at first but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman a dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo who is loyal to the film s imaginative and sinister villain the horned king voiced gruesomely by john hurt yet he also fears his neck the other characters including the sidekicks a spunky but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret although pleasant and likeable aren t quite as well rounded as they should be the story itself is an adventurous one a quest involving the mystical pig hen wen the black cauldron itself and an army of deathless ones with everything a hooking opening to a spectacular finale elmer bernstein s music also tells the story perfectly in a dark yet calming manner the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth the animation overall is top notch overall this film is an entertaining endeavor fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one except young kids there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney s other films although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary which is the main reason why this film is rated pg fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie even though it doesn t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film this film is a classic in its own right and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given that better chance has finally come whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared and the film has finally achieved its place among disney s most proudest achievements i can t help but think though whatever would have happened if the black cauldron was a box office success 
this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday jon bennet played by andrew howard is an extremely good assassin as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him he has become an unquestioning weapon he is in the employ of a kingpin david calder far more evil than he is but even assassins have innocent pasts he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin calder is a familiar actor in britain though not frequently seen in the us he was seen in the world is not enough here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake his lair is underground apparently in a sewer where he lives like the king of sewer rats it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet s life paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin s lair he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness by using semi darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world this is a world that is cold and unfriendly sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross but it is sarossy s film all the way it creates indelible images of evil i rate it an on the to scale and a low on the to scale i do hope they do not use the tagline don t mess with mr in between 
 the end of the affair is a dark and moody romantic period piece that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs although it s slow and sometimes confusing to follow it still manages to give audiences a moving experience based on graham greene s novel of the same name the film mainly follows characters there s maurice bendrix ralph fiennes who has an affair with henry mile s stephen rea wife sarah julianne moore sarah finds henry to be a bore because well he s just a normal guy it s all work and no play with him while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah and would do anything for her unfortunately the two break up this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks so that leads us to the present it s a few years later and they both still think of each other so maurice hires a private detective ian hart to see what sarah is up too while this may sound straight forward it s not it s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men unhappiness and the ever lasting love all this may sound like a drag but it really captures your interest with great performances by ralph fiennes doing another english patient type of film only this movie is better and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all films she did in i believe this was the role she had the most passion for and you can see why the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan even though i didn t read the book there s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive what s so moving about it you ask the tragedy of it all it s not the typical romance in which a guy finds a girl they fall in love and all is well this is more complicated and depressing it really shows the complexity of a relationship because nothing is ever perfect everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces back to neil jordan s script it wasn t only red roses there were times when i felt it too be a little slow but most romances are it also tended to be a bit confusing especially at the start it keep jumping around from past to present so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan i d have to say this is his finest achievement to date because quite frankly i ve never really found his work to be up to par it just never did anything for me until now when it ends it leaves viewers a little saddened but provoked nonetheless this is definitely one of the best films of and had some of the best acting most notably by moore not for all movie goers but for those who are film buffs and want something of value 
richard gere is not one of my favorite actors however i like courtroom dramas and this film looked good enough to take a chance on i wasn t disappointed it wasn t a great film but it was interesting and took several unexpected turns one thing what s with the title not only is it extremely forgettable it doesn t really have much to do with the film as far as i could determine in the long run it will probably hurt the film as people won t be able to think of or remember it martin vail richard gere is a grandiose defense attorney he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending successfully rich scum such as mafia men and drug dealers once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby faced alter boy he wants in on the case presumably for the press he ll get we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover janet venable laura linney vail himself is a former prosecutor and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney played very well by john mahoney frasier s father on the tv series there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie people have public faces and private faces we see this in the murdered archbishop in the accused and most strongly defense attorney martin vail richard gere does a fairly good job at first he appears to be a money and attention grabbing lawyer with no consideration of the truth but we see another side as he becomes a seeker of justice and comes to believe in his client alfre woodard as the judge is capable though somewhat wasted in a standard role laura linney also does journeyman work nothing spectacular but acceptable her relationship with vail is believable their verbal fencing adds to the film the actor who playes vail s investigator unfortunately i don t remember his name is quite good his female assistant she looked very familiar but i can t remember where i ve seen her was also capable but unspectacular the best performance in the film was by edward norton he was excellent as the timid altar boy turned alleged butcher boy of st mike s i was impressed by the depth of the plot there are red herrings and dead ends that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending i liked the plot twists the film took and most of the supporting characters thus i give primal fear a respectable b rating 
albert brooks saves the day just in the nick of time with a very poor summer for movies brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up and does so in a positive way while this may not be his finest work the muse still shakes up some delightful humor in albert brook s latest comedy he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter brooks who s losing his edge as his business partners say in desperation he goes to see his friend jack jeff bridges who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past he asks jack for some help and recieves word of a real life muse that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career so brooks seeks the muse named sarah sharon stone and is suckered into buying her expensive food etc as a sort of payment the real punch line however doesn t come until the end it really makes you wonder how screenwriters really get their ideas could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner speaking of brooks he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter every time he graces the screen i can t help but start laughing albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone she wasn t likeable at all brooks had the right idea with her occupation but she never pulled through in a way she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak luckily brooks could clean up the mess and cover for stone s mishap it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance because the muse had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy on a brighter note andie macdowell was also charming as brook s wife she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she s in the funniest moments in the muse in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese i mean imagine brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice like it was something out of the ordinary it was just plain hilarious it just adds to the satire joke of how directors get ideas brilliant move by brooks as i mentioned before the film is a satire much like it s proceeder bowfinger which came out a few weeks before unlike bowfinger this is not a mean spirited film that s desperate for jokes it s rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood bowfinger had it s moments but had quite a few problems that were never worked out but the muse still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour by the end of the film you re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it for once i m not fully disappointed because the film didn t slow down it kept moving even with some flaws thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort i think he ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future 
 note after claiming otherwise my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh s hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap as it happens it didn t take long is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli known mainly to american audiences as the man behind s romeo and juliet required viewing for many high schoolers and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre one of the twin peaks with wuthering heights of romantic literature it might seem peculiar then that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen at first blush hamlet is far removed from romance the hero though a prince is depressed conflicted and confused the ostensible love interest gets little screen time and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus it is zeffirelli s genius however that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace in this italian master s hands romance is everywhere in a son s worship of his father in the bonds of deepest friendship in the private thoughts of young lovers even in the mystery of castles by the sea after all the story hinges on a ghost and what could be more romantic than that what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all namely hiring then reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a lethal weapon in the series of the same name would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language franco zeffirelli that s who and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful not to mention comprehensible his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed his movements and gestures excepting his sometimes too active eyes are totally in keeping with the character this is a hamlet whose pain we feel whose struggle we empathize with and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film s end glenn close the other big name in the production also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet s mother gertrude though i must confess i m still trying to understand the character as written zeffirelli s incestuous interpretation of hamlet s relationship with his mother doesn t help alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone both support the realistic mood marvelously as do the sets and costumes without any overstated effects that declare this is important this is shakespeare i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare definitive and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen but if you ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard this hamlet is an excellent place to start 
good films are hard to find these days great films are beyond rare proof of life russell crowe s one two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller is one of those rare gems a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting an intelligent script and masterful directing together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days genuine motivation in a story that rings true consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan s character in the film all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world i haven t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah s masterpiece the getaway but enough with the gossip let s get to the review the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman david morse an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti government soldiers upon discovering his identity the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for million the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off and no one will step forward with the money with no choice available to her bowman s wife alice ryan hires terry thorne crowe a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative to arrange the return of her husband but when things go wrong as they always do in these situations terry and his team which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year david caruso take matters into their own hands the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character driven vehicle filled with well written dialogue shades of motivation and convincing acting by all the actors the script is based on both a book the long march to freedom and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap ransom situations and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy screenwriter of the devil s advocate and dolores claiborne the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan but that between crowe and david caruso dug out from b movie hell caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe s right hand gun while providing most of the film s humor ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic gunslinger character of terry thorne the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes the bulk of those scenes which bookend the movie work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story s characters the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise director taylor hackford mixes both his old school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film proof of life is a thinking man s action movie it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war and the sacrifices one makes for those choices the sacrifices that help you sleep at night 
quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie he runs into the last dragon in existence and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain eventually they decide to call a truce and they work out a deal since he is the last dragon he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it their scam works at first until they come to a town without any money instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon but of course draco is a nice droagon so he won t eat her there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl of course as you can probably tell by the plot this is a silly movie but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times unlike eddie which was serious all the time you could probably call this a medieval comedy because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined dennis quaid makes a fine hero pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl but lets face it the movie is really about the dragon and what an amazing creation he is connery s voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon so if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic you are going to the wrong movie if you are going because of the dragon you will not be dissapointed and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script 
elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid s it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings internally the catholics wage war against the protestants meanwhile spain scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth cate blanchett will be their greatest hope for survival the film charts elizabeth s tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom as a protestant she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen but her half sister queen mary kathy burke deathly ill and unable to conceive a child pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne mary gives her her blessing on only one condition that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land once declared queen elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault both by her own subjects including the duke of norfolk played with steely eyed grace by christopher eccleston and by forces abroad slowly but surely the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham geoffrey rush in a perfectly subtle performance also on her side is sir william cecil sir richard attenborough her well meaning but misguided chief adviser with few people she can trust elizabeth must prove her self worth any way she can even if it means being the iron fisted ruler she secretly despises blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self consciousness and shrewd charisma though not a classical beauty blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk she is at home with her character s playful tendencies particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley joseph fiennes whether fending off unctuous suitors or playing the houses in court blanchett s elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur s visual delights he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes rolling green hills extravagant ceremonial galas dark and foreboding corridors all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here though writer michael hirst s script gets a little murky at times and his injections of humor get a little overplayed elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing as a whole the story survives because elizabeth s struggle is one which deserves attention by the time she makes her shocking but very sensible final declaration we re ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen 
truman true man burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey s character in this film president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide in spite of or was it because of his stature truman also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans and burbank california brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc if hollywood is the center of the film world burbank is or was the center of tv s world the world where our protagonist lives combine all these names and concepts into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world truman leads the perfect life his town his car and his wife are picture perfect his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light the next day during the drive to work the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian when the radio comes back to normal the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door made to look like the back of an elevator into place two security guards grab him and throw him out truman is really suspicious now it gets even worse the next day when his wife a nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge it s best not to think about it she says trying vainly to change truman s memory truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world you know by now that truman s life is the subject of a television program his actions are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father to the choice of his wife truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is meanwhile christof the all seeing creator of truman s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy it s sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view we root for the captive of the cage world our protagonist is counting on chaos theory to help him escape his elaborate trap the story written by andrew niccol writer director of gattaca introduces some interesting questions such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake although these questions came to mind i don t think the film itself asked them it certainly didn t address them or try to answer them i was particularly disappointed that the film didn t deal more with the trauma of learning one s life is a tv show carrey s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman s pain but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film s pacing earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol didn t see it that way perhaps it s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn t but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here but on its own terms the movie is well made sight sound and pacing are all handled competently much of the first part of the movie is the truman show the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen the music is well chosen and scored the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music when truman s world is still beautiful and perfect when the movie ends the score sounds more like a frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates truman s scenes of suspicion and awakening glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show and the pacing of the story was brisk there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just a few quick title cards a few interviews and then right into the show and the movie one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling there was no token scene of truman s idyllic life before it falls apart because it wasn t necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner there s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down it s a quick straight shot to the movie s end in terms of overall quality i would compare the truman show to niccol s gattaca both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas neither film clicked and became an instant classic nevertheless i look forward to niccol s next film whatever it may be 
not since oliver stone s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary and not since david cronenberg has a so called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility while fincher s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value his major character killings in both alien and seven are fine examples fight club marks the distillation of his pitch black comedic sensibility see s the game into something like a definitive statement jack norton acting as both narrator and protagonist is your typical cubicle clone whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia on the offhand advice of a doctor he sits in on group therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer here he meets bob marvin lee aday aka meat loaf a cancer emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia strangely the release he finds while sobbing on bob s breasts allows him to sleep at night at least until a fellow group therapy tourist named marla singer carter comes along to ruin things for him forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity later he meets tyler durden pitt a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life one night after his ikea furnished condo explodes don t ask you ll just have to see the movie awright he is goaded by tyler into a fight and damned if it doesn t feel good it is pure raw existence a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison he moves into tyler s squalid abandoned mansion and they form the titular organization an underground therapy group where men bond with bare knuckle savagery and very few rules the first two of which are don t talk about fight club armed with charisma and an attractive anti corporate philosophy tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white collar slaves and dead end mcemployees resentment creeps into jack s heart made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla funded by a frivolous lawsuit tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem their initially juvenile pranks like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads quickly evolve into something more like sedition and jack fears that things have gone sour it is after this point when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist it is so contrived and so conventional compared to what precedes it that everything which follows including the ending becomes far less interesting it s a major though not fatal flaw and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher it feels like a cop out fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people in the early going it has a downright dangerous feel it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it i ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don t spring up here and there and i ll be even more amazed if fincher isn t vilified for it by the same humorless witch hunters that are currently after oliver stone they needn t bother because fight club is less a message movie than fincher s elaborate attempt at a joke tyler durden for all his dionysian allure is really nothing more than the logical and far less hypocritical extrapolation of all those self help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me first gospel of self actualization in this context the joke works but like the latest columbine joke some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh and others won t hopefully though their silly moral outrage won t spoil the joke for the rest of us 
in roger michell s romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it s name to the film s title one day american movie superstar anna scott julia roberts walks in to purchase a book on turkey quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an on again off again love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat the film opens with a non verbal cue to anna s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress s appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such without words this sequence gives us a background to her character following however is a set up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives i don t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning but there it is if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view as he is in every scene by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily in fact much of notting hill s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricots from his refrigerator or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image william assures her he wouldn t say a word then adds well i ll probably tell myself now and then but i d never believe it great stuff the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible we re constantly exposed to william s thoughts feelings actions and desires but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the times in between this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grant s film hands down he gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast most notable is rhys ifans as spike william s eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh hugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as william s friends and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst it s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type for example there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as william s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air we re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film s scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect it s kind of a mixed bag but still fares better than many of today s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate notting hill s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all time greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it for a couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and that s not so bad now is it 
hedwig john cameron mitchell was born a boy named hansel in east berlin as a teen seeking his other half he reluctantly agrees to a sex change operation in order to marry american g i luther maurice dean wint the operation performed by a hack surgeon is botched and the angry inch is all that s left now a she hedwig comes to america is abandoned by luther forms a rock band and falls for her year old lover prot g tommy only to be rejected by him later too she and her band the angry inch shadows the now famous tommy gnosis across the us for revenge but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in hedwig and the angry inch first time helmer john cameron mitchell along with composer lyricist stephen trask created and starred in their acclaimed off broadway production that has become the movie and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs outrageous costumes sets and makeup and especially a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for i am by far not a big fan of musicals sure there are exceptions like bob fosse s all that jazz and cabaret but for the most part they are just not my cup of tea hedwig and the angry inch is an exception though with its combination of humor wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from the rocky horror picture show and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols the original songs by stephen trask also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch are full of energy and variety and even though it s not my kind of music i found every one entertaining and fun the audience i saw hedwig with thought so too the main attraction to this one man woman show is the presence of its star john cameron mitchell gives a solid sometimes fun sometimes angry performance as a person searching for self enlightenment and love as a young boy growing up in east berlin hansel is abused by his g i father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that mother would make me play in the oven where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio later as a young man he meets luther another g i and is swept off of his feet the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after flash forward to a trailer park in junction city kansas and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy frustrated and broke she takes on baby sitting and the odd job to make ends meet she also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born she meets falls for and loses young tommy who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation jealous and angry hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommy s tours and with the help of her manager phyllis stein andrea martin is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs hedwig and the angry inch get gigs not coincidentally at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing things finally come to a head so to speak in new york city the popularity of the off broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready made audience base for hedwig the wit humor music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been it is this one man woman show that casts its spotlight on its internationally ignored rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role there isn t a lot going on with other characters though there are amusing little sidebars like hedwig s backup singer lover yitzak miriam shor deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of rent as a puerto rican drag queen the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film attention to details hedwig s costumes and outrageous cabaret like makeup the seedy trailer park setting and the kitschy seafood restaurants are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds all on what has to be a beer budget hedwig and the angry inch may not be for everybody but the energy of the effort the songs the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch if you re a fan of contemporary edgy music it is an even bigger draw i give it a b 
this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood s most famous celebrities some fabulous animation and a compelling story this is the best we ve seen from disney since beauty and the beast this film begins an unspecified time following the happily ever after conclusion to toy story in the aftermath of their earlier adventures buzz voice of tim allen and woody voice of tom hanks are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony content with their lives one day andy broke woody s arm off while playing with him woody is now officially discarged and worthless left with his nightmares where he lies in a trash can with the other discards later andy s mother decides to have a yard sale and she collects a few old toys from her son s room since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang woody goes to the rescue leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back although his mission is successful he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al voice of wayne knight spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series woody s roundup if he can acquire woody al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit so after andy s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy al steals him and it s up to the other toys led by buzz to go into the city to save their friend and so buzz rex voice of wallace shawn hamm voice of john ratzenberger mr potatohead voice of don rickles and slinky voice of jim varney go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys there are car chases gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis who by the way resembles darth vader meanwhile woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family a cowgirl named jessie voice of joan cusack a horse named bullseye and a father figure called the prospector voice of kelsey grammar they offer him another life as a celebrity a toy in a museum in japan he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while before he grows up and be forgotten or be admired by children for generations the problem is if woody escapes from al s clutches and returns home they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage a real effort is made in the technical department the animation is rich and colorful with lots of wonderful details the cinematography is also extremely improved since toy story there are a lot of complicated swings turns and close ups that really make an impression lighting and filters are used to create a mood as in a surprisingly emotional moment jessie s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy the film contains a lot of in side jokes such as the one about videogames and entertaining parodies on jurassic park and star wars the film ends with the failed takes the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film but what in the end makes toy story a memorable experience is not the jokes its multiple parodies or marvelous animation it is its heart and emotions the story about the meaning of friendship love and even life itself it is not difficult to predict that toy story would be a huge economical success but its artistic achievement was unexpected unexpected because the first film wasn t much more than a demonstration of special effects but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn t produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that years this is a big step away from the ancient laws of disney animation off course this is not antz it is not as intelligent this is not a landmark and no masterpiece but i promise that you ll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have whether this is the best animated film of the year i dare not say my choice would probably be the iron giant but along side with american pie this is the comedy of the year i almost lost my hopes for disney but toy story proves that disney hasn t lost their ability to entertain 
 the deep end uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues alluring attractive blues but also icy and foreboding after taking in their beauty the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land the production works that way as well it pulls you in initially as a crisp thoroughly modern thriller with clipped exchanges between defiantly non communicative characters but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as the deep end gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating spoiler alert the following reveals the basic storyline i believe the plot points are incidental because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters but still you should proceed at your own risk with her husband tom a naval officer often away at sea margaret hall tilda swinton holds down the fort taking care of the children beau jonathan tucker paige tamara hope and dylan jordon dorrance while her father in law jack peter donat hovers in the background always watching the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno it seems that beau her eldest is having an affair with darby reese josh lucas a disreputable sort years his senior margaret demands that darby leave her son alone only to have the man smirk at her and announce he ll be glad to steer clear of beau for back at home she tries to talk about it all with her son but the kid won t even confirm that he s gay let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend he does however get attentive when she reveals darby s offer even as he maintains his sullen demeanor late in the evening darby shows up outside tossing pebbles at beau s window like a schoolchild the two meet by the water at the boathouse where something important happens i won t reveal what suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie by the way within a day or so margaret s life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape once margaret coughs up oh what s a mother to do end spoilers written directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel suture the deep end is based on elisabeth sanxay holding s s novel the blank wall which was also the source of the film the reckless moment i ve neither read the book nor seen the movie but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details in holding s story the scandalous relationship is between an older man and margaret s teen age daughter switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary and it also raises questions about margaret s motives many reviews of the deep end describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son but i wonder consider this margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a larger than life figure her father in law is constantly present almost as if he is monitoring for his son and when her husband does call margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family so is margaret a mother who accepts her son s sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea you sort it out regardless the resonance of the deep end comes from two actors goran visnjic best known from the tv drama er is striking as a blackmailer unlike any you ve seen before he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol chivalry and simmering eroticism but the star of this show without a doubt is the remarkable tilda swinton watch the shadings depth resource vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her days after my second viewing of the deep end i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water the deep end is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it 
scream like its predecessor is a genre crossing film it is about horror film and murder mystery the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time scream was also known for its self referential tone many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven again scream follows suit with characters saying such things as sequels suck and the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels scream s story is very similar to it s predecessor s sidney neve campbell having survived the killing spree in scream is now in college gale weathers courteney cox has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film called stab which for all practical purposes is the real world movie scream at the premiere of stab two students from sidney s college are stabbed to death and a new story begins the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer they want to know all about the links between stab sidney and the recent murders the most complex self reference i saw this should be an olympic event was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press the audience was watching the whole filmed scene whew the movie is packed with layers and self references that make it a pleasure to watch even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream that s not to say that these references necessarily make scream a deep or even a good movie the just add to the fun of watching it i recommend it for other reasons as well what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible it is a person in a mask and a robe his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies you have less grounds to say it s just a movie the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself gale weathers and deputy dewey david arquette also from the original track down a killer they are likeable but not outstanding but in combination with the horror aspect the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream the internet movie database says that scream is in the works so i wonder if i ll be doing the same thing on january if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high i ll be happy to mark my calendar 
i don t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people but it s something i used to wonder about when i was younger i can t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat but i m pretty sure andrew niccol screenwriter for the truman show has had the same curious thought the truman show is about a man jim carrey whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public since birth he s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven fla which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign all the people in truman burbank s life are actors and the anonymous townfolk paid extras people watch truman s life hours a day live with no commercial interruptions revenue comes instead from product placement a staple of contemporary hollywood with truman s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else even if you haven t seen the truman show you ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials the trailer and other promotion blitzes if anything i ve written so far is a surprise to you then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news either way you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it because otherwise you ll probably think it sucks it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror reciting the crucial eat me scene from alive wishing his neighbors a good day afternoon and evening and living in domestic bliss with his wife laura linney but weird things start happening a stage light comes falling out of the sky truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child sailing through a rainstorm the death was staged by director christof ed harris who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth not the least of them truman s best friend marlon noah emmerich who assures him he s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he d ever do is hurt him as truman s trusting eyes tear over christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else there s even a daily behind the scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman s existence the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions and it all hinges on carrey who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on he s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura most fundamentally it s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person s life without the person realizing it how they coordinate extras hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this sure the most interesting tv genre of the s has been reality programming and jerry springer s popularity is through the roof but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves and when news shows use hidden cameras it s done in the name of the greater good not entertainment but merge the two and you ve got the truman show right now it s implausible i mean the fcc won t let you say the s word on the air do you think they d let you broadcast every detail of a man s life to the entire world without his consent one day though it could happen and even though it would mean the end of privacy people would eat it up you know they would 
 minutes not rated though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn t very well known to most american audiences but perhaps it should be oshii was the director of last year s best known japanese animated film import ghost in the shell and is known among fans of japanese animation or anime for making films with a deep philosophical bent one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series in its many incarnations graphic novels manga two different runs of made for video episodes original animation videos or oavs for short and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan set in the very near future though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived this atypical giant robot anime features the characters rather than the machinery as the primary focus as a whole patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains giant industrial robots known as labors an interesting play on words considering that robot is derived from the czech word for labor have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century with the rise of labors however has come a new menace labor crime this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions using patrol labors to fight labor crime the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division sv who through no fault of their own have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness sometimes utterly hilarious sometimes almost deadly serious the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers the story as has much of patlabor before centers around the controversial babylon project a gigantic seawall that will on its completion allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists most notably the house of sea organization however the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist but from someone who is already dead shinohara heavy industries the premier labor manufacturer in japan if not the whole world has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors movement speed and efficiency by this hyper operating system hos for short has very quickly been installed into well over of the nation s labors including the patrol labors of sv since that installation dozens of labors including a heavily armed military model have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos some wags have compared this to windows it s up to asuma shinohara labor command officer with sv and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries to find the source of these problems before more labors including sv s own fall victim to them and before hos drags his father s company down with it as was the case with ghost in the shell if you just want a no brainer actionfest this might not be the movie for you patlabor the movie is more of a psychological thriller a technological suspense drama it is closer perhaps to a chrichton novel than to an action movie crichton novels that have been made into action movies notwithstanding there are long thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo similar to sequences from ghost in the shell this movie is fraught with symbolism in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism patlabor s near future setting is aside from the giant robots tromping around very similar to our own present day the film uses this setting to make its central point is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor s alternate setting as far as the technical aspects of the film go referring to the subtitled version as that s the only one i ve seen the film transfer is clear almost phenomenally so the animation quality is incredible though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to the oavs and tv series were more cheerful better suited to humor the movie however makes everyone look a great deal less cute and emphasizes that this is going to be for the most part a deadly serious storyline as far as cinematography goes there are many interesting moments in patlabor the movie i don t think i can recall ever seeing a fish eye perspective used in any other animated film save for ghost in the shell another oshii film or indeed in many other movies at all the cinematography is well suited to the storyline emphasizing what it needs to though a couple of scenes where characters features are exaggerated in anger may seem slightly strange to western audiences the audio track of patlabor the movie is in glorious hi fi stereo and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems it is that good even without headphones sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to come from that side giant robot footsteps are deep and booming the sometimes understated sometimes blaring score is crisp and clear and always right on the mark enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery as far as the subtitles go i have to say that they re among the most easily readable subtitles i ve ever seen for anything large enough that they don t strain the eyes but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen although it does have several action sequences in it most notably the climactic conclusion patlabor is foremost not an action movie although it is a superbly realized film it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story and that could detract from some people s enjoyment my 
in one scene from the people vs larry flynt the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self staged free speech rally as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him flynt strides confidently across the stage delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in patton where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag both scenes were stirring larger than life richly entertaining and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies overall that sums up the people vs larry flynt the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which despite being based on fact feels like a big phony hollywood movie the son of a kentucky moonshiner flynt woody harrelson ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati there he met althea leasure courtney love a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life to bolster interest in his clubs he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine flynt along with the magazine s rag tag management team headed by his brother jimmy played nicely by woody s real life brother steak shake commercial veteran brett harrelson viewed playboy magazine with contempt they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos striving to keep hustler focused on what guys really want explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm and extremely crude humor the film s prime example of hustler s attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt s naughtiness director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine s frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation racism and endless scatological cartoons flynt s rag labored in well deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis which brought the magazine international attention big money and the attention of conservatives an obscenity bust followed the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law lawyer alan isaacman edward norton enters the scene hired by flynt s wife norton an exceptional actor is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt s increasingly childish and bizarre behavior in court we meet the sputtering conservatives headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating james cromwell as keating blathers about flynt s immorality the camera slowly moves in for a close up of his name tag inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating who was later convicted in a billion s l fraud flynt s other prime foe is rev jerry falwell who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would be assassin leaving him paralyzed from the waist down a dark period follows as flynt and leasure hole up in an l a suite strung out on pain killers flynt eventually kicks drugs but leasure succumbs to addiction and later aids after watch falwell on tv describing aids as a punishment from god flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court leading to the film s climactic courtroom scene the people vs larry flynt is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt if they ll protect a scumbag like me then they ll protect all of you declared flynt he s right of course but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt harrelson is an attractive charismatic man and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero even a cursory look at the real flynt who is making the talk show circuit and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene shows a bloated morose and bitter man an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch but a richer one despite its flaws flynt is a fast moving rousing movie with some terrific acting especially by courtney love whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod the story may be candy coated but it s still delicious candy 
it has been years since a terrence malick film hit theaters his new film the thin red line is a strange beautiful enigmatic mess of a movie the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast it is filled with above the title stars the cast for the most part gives great performances john travolta whose role is nothing more than a cameo seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve george clooney whose role became a cameo in editing gives a strange performance one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character s narration the rest of the cast especially nick nolte and elias koteas are unambiguously fantastic these actors and they are with two exceptions men were lured by the name of malick terrence malick is a cinematic legend he has often been called the j d salinger of cinema his two previous films badlands and days of heaven are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures after he made them he disappeared for years this film marks his return what he s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment the narration which fills the film and perplexes many not only lets us hear the narrators the characters themselves pontificate but also lets us hear such of the moment thoughts as i m scared the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult because the story is fractured many stories are here from the clash between the lieutenant elias koteas and the savage colonel a voracious nick nolte to the private ben chaplin who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box shook the box and poured the results onto a table this basically creates a mess but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed i m not declaring that the film has no structure while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about minutes of combat the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video ultimately malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature while some have said that the anti war message and pro nature tubthumping was juvenile it was done with so much complexity and thought that it cannot ever honestly be called childish after seeing the thin red line i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again 
the first thing you notice about this movie is that it s cold placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow covered ground against a background of white just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night as with most coen brothers films this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes each of which works out in the oddest way possible a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does in brief scenes of vicious violence people get shot through the head in the back face chest and various other areas of the anatomy there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen remarkably enough most of the movie is played for laughs even more remarkably it works the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff frances mcdormand who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity with every good film the audience gains new knowledge here you learn two things everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy and don t do violent illegal business with low life amoral degenerate scum sucking losers oh yeah if you get shot in the face using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy 
jean luc picard patrick stewart and the rest of the crew of the u s s enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the s series star trek gone are kirk spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek the next generation as usual a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist s will it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction it doesn t do a bad job other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek fan only jokes while many of the others just fall flat the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet why do they have to be moved the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f murray abraham s aliens who number only a couple of dozen so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion at least that s plausible but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen which makes no sense whatsoever the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf michael dorn the trusty klingon worf was on star trek the next generation so they want to include him in the films no problem so far worf is now a character of star trek deep space nine so the writers have to find a way to have him show up in the last star trek movie first contact the included worf in a credible fashion in this one the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren t hanging on every word on the screen my minor problems with the movie aside star trek insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones while many of the jokes do miss the mark many are pretty good even for non trekkies the special effects are among the best for the star trek series the action is plentiful and well done this is a very good looking movie it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek the next generation that the acting is first rate it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series if you ve always hated star trek there is nothing here that is going to change your mind star trek insurrection is not the best film in the series but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones 
you ve probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over keeping the faith it s a fluffy comedy thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer regarding two moral topics love and religion and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head on as youngsters brian finn jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio while their friendship progressed anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support so neither would feel excluded but tragedy soon struck as anna was forced to move away now adults brian edward norton and jacob ben stiller hold similar but contrastive jobs the likable and kind hearted father brian is a catholic priest while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi on the basketball court they refer to themselves as the god squad in the relationship field brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory everything changes when anna jenna elfman returns to new york to visit her childhood chums now a workaholic she devotes endless hours per week to her business but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail there s bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult but keeping the faith is open entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b edward norton has emerged as one of the finest most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the thriller primal fear after shockingly bitter roles in american history x and most recently david fincher s vicious fight club a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice not in the least norton slips into the director s chair for the first time with keeping the faith and here his incisive resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg weighing every aspect it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut in addition norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian generating a thoroughly likable screen presence stiller the zipper guy from there s something about mary is firm and funny boasting a fully ripened comic maturity elfman s perky repetition can grow tiresome such is occasionally the case on tv s dharma and greg but she seems perfectly rambunctious here the remaining cast members offer fine support from anne bancroft as jacob s animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice keeping the faith is the perfect date flick though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general there is turbulence during the process of lift off as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead once the film does settle in it is often funny and always cheerful stiller norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities we enjoy their interaction understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true this is excluding the ending which is acceptable and all but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements nonetheless a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won t wipe the smile off your face nor anyone else s in the audience keeping the faith is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion aww what the hell the quality is not quite heaven sent but this little charmer could revive our faith in a potentially tired filmmaking genre 
at first glance it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of year olds that s true of home alone and i d bet money that it s true of home alone opening soon but home alone actually has a lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesn t get in the way the mcalisters all of them are going to france for the holidays four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse the littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kids cruelty kevin s patience runs out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza has already been eaten and he s going to have to starve he attacks his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him the fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table a few cousins and an uncle the knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased but they all point their fingers when he fights back the ultimate punishment comes from mom catherine o hara who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night on his way up the stairs he tells her that families suck and that he hopes never to see any of his family again that night the power goes out knocking out the alarm clocks so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport in a surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family heads off without him it s interesting that in a subtle way his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling and second they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class they re two thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child meanwhile kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true he s finally rid of his family life is a dream come true he can jump on the beds watch r rated movies eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips and dig through his big brother s secret box slowly the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane he grooms himself he does the laundry he goes shopping i bought some milk eggs and fabric softener he also starts to miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring the furnace in the basement is a scary monster the old man next door is a snow shovel murderer and two crooks are trying to break into his house macaulay culkin is cute but he isn t much of an actor still we can see that kevin s character grows thanks to some good direction and editing for example acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night just as santa is getting in his car kevin asks the man to pass on his request he wants his family back to the real santa he learned how to deal with the furnace you turn on the lights and it s not so scary anymore he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow shovel murderer who actually turns out to be a nice man they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid finally in the last minutes kevin confronts his last fear the bandits head on literally this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movie s genuine dramatic setup it is dessert it s a lot of fun and it doesn t overwhelm the rest of the movie on the whole home alone is a great holiday movie john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings but it does have its flaws the smallest problem is that culkin doesn t act very well as i said before he is cute but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin s insight into his character the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villains threaten kevin s life about five times instead of i m gonna get that kid they say i m gonna kill that kid some might argue that the tone is the same but i strongly disagree mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux pas i ll probably never see home alone and i wish i had skipped home alone but i do enjoy home alone almost every year don t let your impressions of the others detract from the original which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick

we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist years later we see his subsequent resurfacing in the mid s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown based on the life story of david helfgott this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child genius compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father in the s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy the film traces his relationship with his father whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys david is offered places in the usa but his father refuses to let him leave australia the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher s house he is well lit via the external house lights his teacher isn t home we pull back and see that the dark front room s window has it s curtains open there in a pool of blackness is a grand piano david s fall over the dark cliff has begun instead of being told in a linear mode shine jumps around in time ala pulp fiction this narrative device works well we see david as a boy teenager in london and mental patient in various snippets the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion adult helfgott s return to the light is told in linear fashion the lead role is played by different actors with the teenage david taylor and adult david rush standing out whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia i think this is his first major cinema work his david whilst clearly damaged he keeps quoting his daddy in a babbling word torrent cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts is both touching and funny taylor s teenage david is the more sympathy producing role we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov s rd whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects one scene has adult helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice with a clever subtlety the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping but of the same beat the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd but it s us being clapped we are young david walking up to the stage for our first public show the music as you would expect from a film of this subject matter is critical and it works very well the miming of the actors piano playing is faultless apparently rush didn t mime he really did play helfgott s life is certainly not without it s sympathetic people indeed his return to the normal world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft it shows that with the help of god we can all find our way back home 
this remake of la cage aux folles features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son s future in laws the couple robin williams and nathan lane are about as archetypal or as the less kind might put it stereotypical gays possible williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode williams is excellent as should be no surprise gene hackman as right wing potential father in law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles the real star is lane his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight shooting uncle is hilarious perhaps it is a personal failing on my part but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it luckily for me at least it doesn t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men their son and the deception the question of stereotypes is a touchy one these guys personify the homophobic gay image you can almost hear the swishing if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world you ll be outraged but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals you ll love it your choice 
i know what i would do with million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site especially if i were with jacob and lou huh well in any event that is the situation hank paxton finds himself in he and his dim witted brother jacob thorton and tubby friend lou brent briscoe come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck against his better judgement hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret and is it worth it a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things clay pigeons and even fargo and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle oh and its much better than any of those sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak show horror monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course one of the film s components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick s the thin red line in malick s three hour bore a thon he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass a small bird or a flowing body of water sure there were obvious metaphorical connections but there was no subtlty to his efforts raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters i think most viewers may miss the comparison but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film and then there s billy bob thorton who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood if it can continute to produce people like thorton hollywood will be ok he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade but is is just as complex if not more so jacob is slow and simple and yet we so often see him deep in thought i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say or didn t know how to say or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry though the plot is somewhat unoriginal it has a very appealing new twist in its characters paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group a far cry from chet in wierd science perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice giving wife but she certainly doesn t do anything ruin the picture a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un redeeming but at least this one has an important message unlike so many of its counterparts 
 last night could have an aka tagged on the end of it that says it s the end of the world and we feel fine last night is about just that the last night of planet earth s existence the world is going to end at precisely midnight january st how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained nor is the event itself throughout the entire movie no explanation is given as to why this is happening in doing this mckellar who also wrote and directed the film seems to be trying to transcend the genre he s attempted to make a film about people and how each of them deals with their last night of life the film contains no science fiction elements which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material the film is set in toronto and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence there s mckellar who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs but keeps getting interrupted by a woman sandra oh in search of her husband her husband played by david cronenberg is spending the day working at the gas company informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end finally there s mckellar s friend played by callum keith rennie a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i ve seen in a film in months these people all felt real to me especially the character played by sandra oh we can see her desperation her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours rennie is good too as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies he exudes such charm and likeablity it s not surprising that we re rooting for him to get what he wants but for me the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar i knew that he was a talented director but i had no idea he could act as well his insistence to be alone much to the dismay of his parents is something that most people would find difficult to understand but as played by mckellar we can understand his reasons he doesn t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone s going to die he should immediately find some companionship he realizes the relationship would be forced and they would only be together for the sake of being together mckellar gives a brilliant performance and i hope he alternates between directing and acting my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending i really wanted to know and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn t want the material to rule the film and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious however in not telling the audience what the cause of earth s destruction is he s left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film another problem is we never see anybody panicking i would imagine if the world was ending and there was nothing to be done about it a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds instead we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it s new year s eve i just didn t buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate no one had the urge to rage against the dying of the light despite these small problems last night is one of the best movies of the year as opposed to the moronic armageddon last night treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty and bruce willis never shows up to save the day 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned the teaser trailers for my best friend s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope it looked like the sort of goofy light hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight but little more i d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend s wedding was such a success a strong bouyant romantic comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects featuring a triumphant performance from ms roberts the heroine of my best friend s wedding is julianne potter julia roberts a successful new york restaurant critic and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes rupert everett that years ago she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex lover michael o neal dermot mulroney a sports writer that if they both hadn t married by the time they reached they had promised to marry each other both julianne and michael are both single of course and when george inquires about michael s age julianne realizes that he s mere weeks away from his th birthday and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day however she finds herself even more distraught when michael s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace cameron diaz and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary the setup for my best friend s wedding then is a fairly conventional one and in many ways the film s storyline is formulaic but only to a certain extent the film was directed by p j hogan whose first feature muriel s wedding had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly duckling story and the same holds true for my best friend s wedding which confidently combines traditional romantic comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr hogan for example there s a heartfelt emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film with a trio of teenagers inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks harmonizing in the background my best friend s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen s everyone says i love you i d even assert it s a more successful one my best friend s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well in a typical romantic comedy kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty conniving ice queen and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps this film is smarter than that here kimmy is sweet sincere and innocent julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy s life she d actually like her too the george character is almost a staple of recent film the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason but in my best friend s wedding he gets to have a playful mischievous and charming personality throughout the film the formulaisms one often sees is romantic comedy are given little twists and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion there is a lot of smart writing in the well paced screenplay by ronald bass we re given four interesting vivid and likeable characters with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments my best friend s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts who turns in a top notch confident and reassured performance as julianne this isn t the sort of role one usually associates with ms roberts the julianne character s neurotic fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role but ms roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience if not entirely sympathetic even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable even better than ms roberts though is cameron diaz who turns in a shining performance in my best friend s weddding with a smile which lights up the screen she effectively conveys kimmy s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner and never hits a false note in the film she even sings i won t soon forget her charming serenade of i just don t know what to do with myself rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film his george is a bit of a devilish rogue entirely affable and mr everett s performance is a delight to watch he s clearly having fun and his joy is infectuous dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role unlike the other characters in the film he s not given a lot to do but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms roberts and mr mulroney and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic when julia roberts lustre began to fade and she was usurped from her title as america s sweetheart by sandra bullock i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to

richard gere can be a commanding actor but he s not always in great films everything comes together here gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity it doesn t go exactly as he expects gere s client aaron edward norton is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop the evidence is stacked against him he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishop s blood his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene he has a relationship with the priest gere talks to the boy believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer despite the lawyer s proclamations that he doesn t care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with people s lives he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him lots of complications and twists the prosecuting attorney is gere s former co worker and lover they both work each other s motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on gere s case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas gere is exceptional as the well dressed reserved counselor but just once i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his suit persona even when he loses it you don t see very far inside norton s aaron is convincing he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story as with most of the effective courtroom dramas the cinematography is crisp and rich the story will keep you on the edge of your seat nothing is what it seems 
 psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget third rate rip off but no this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria perhaps italian horror director dario argento s most consistently successful film what impresses most in re watching this surrealistic supernatural thriller is that argento s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near fully coherent narrative screenplays have always been his achilles heel confusing subplots gaping holes totally illogical incidents and reactions no question argento has always been a better director than a writer fortunately he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called suspiria de profundis the film s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance arriving at the school late at night in driving rain she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state what happens next and i don t make the comparison lightly is a murder sequence that for intensity shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock s infamous shower scene in psycho it s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock but with its baroque sets graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin this stunning sequence remains very much argento s own though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria s opening minutes the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour old matriarch from hell roles she does so well several more violent murders ensue including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is well i wouldn t want to spoil things now would i and the film s climax staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms has a gothic ghoulishness that s most impressive the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming and not just for the violence deep red and phenomena for example have been appallingly hacked about fortunately the cuts to suspiria about minutes in this version have not adversely affected the film the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done too excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region and the soundtrack it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else as it stands the use of goblin s music in suspiria is outstanding apparently argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer s overall experience even better see suspiria in a cinema where you ll get the added bonus of widescreen and the colours deep reds eerie blues a superb use of shadow and contrast the cinematography of luciano tovoli whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female is uniformly superb a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento s more surreal excursions the other most notable example being inferno on which bassan also worked suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors and it is fully deserving of its cult status the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated that s always been one of argento s shortcomings but overall this is a fascinating compelling example of italian horror 
 dimension films scream s distributor has asked press to say extremely little if anything about the film s twisty plot that s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here but i will do my best to be vague now there s a first the first one was good but all the rest sucked said a cinematically savvy teen in last winter s wes craven thriller scream her statement referring to the films of the nightmare on elm street series but really putting down franchise overkill in general the comment certainly carries clout for every truly great sequel there appears to be a couple of duds making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas but like it or not along comes scream and believe it or not it s a doozy a slick sinister madly subversive good time at the movies as intent on sending up hollywood s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions scream is definitely that rare movie thing a follow up that can stand along side its original with pride it s been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch esque get ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro california those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives plucky heroine sidney prescott neve campbell is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college her pop culture whiz pal randy meeks jamie kennedy has tagged along trash tabloid reporter gale weathers courteney cox has written a best seller based on their ordeal the basis of which has been turned into a very bad movie called stab and dewey riley david arquette still suffering from wounds inflicted during scream has left his job as a police officer for a while life is tranquil at least for a while several sudden murders bring sidney randy gale and dewey together again but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings if these four people learned anything from the past it s to trust no one thus the possible victim potential killer list includes said quartet as well as derek jerry o connell sidney s new beau cici sara michelle gellar a chatty sorority gal joel duane martin gale s cameraman who s not too thrilled with her blood soaked past hallie elise neal sidney s sassy roommate debbie laurie metcalf a local reporter who gives gale some not too friendly competition and mickey timothy olyphant randy s good friend and fellow film student cotton weary liev schreiber the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother s murder in scream also shows up on campus but why like the first scream craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang this time it s an extended sequence that finds an african american couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending a sneak preview of stab making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non roles of blacks in slasher cinema before tragedy ensues at the screening the movie within a movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments including a scene from stab which turns scream s now famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear b hang up the phone and star his a pinkett yells at the screen it s funny creepy stuff i don t think i ll ever feel safe in a movie theater again that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone assault of the killer on randy dewey and gale in broad daylight it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters there are other superb set pieces but explaining them risks ruining their effect there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count it s something of a trade in the new characters are too large in number to be as fully developed as the original scream gang but this movie packs in knowing performances especially by kennedy and cox and more death for your dollar it can be argued that while the original might outclass it by a tad scream is both scarier and funnier it certainly doesn t skimp with shocks a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart i actually questioned craven and williamson s judgment here considering how much this person has added to these films sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab the two scenes we re shown are dead on but for film fans there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like the usual suspects aliens and the empire strikes back still scream does so many things right it s petty to quibble its penchant for parody is irresistible discussions of the merits of film sequels and all the attractive solid cast is a definite bonus and the denouement while not as shocking as scream s is priceless the film s final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in scream with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper all this and a scream is in the works knowing the series tendency for self reference perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice mentioning scream ll help them in their argument 
full metal jacket very much like every other hard hitting film about the vietnam war is an shocking emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man private joker played by matthew modine during his tour in the vietnam war however full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before boot camp these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning as in platoon full metal jacket gets off to a quick start the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits which is getting their heads shaved from there they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman played extremely well by the former drill instructor r lee ermey apparently the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence vincent d onofrio whom is dubbed gomer pyle by sgt hartman the film is continually narrated by private joker in which he explains his visions on what is going on the entire corps although repeatedly hammered by sgt hartman continues on private pyle however seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation and it basically does not stop that is until sgt hartman comes up with a new plan he will punish the rest of the soon to be marines for pyle s goof ups even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits and things take a turn for the worst pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally physically and mentally cut out for the life of a marine after graduation joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war which is his service he is not a member of the infantry and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat when he sets out on a documenting mission this question becomes very clear from the start joker joins up with a platoon along with his hometown friend cowboy arliss howard and follows their everyday actions interviewing and filmming them along the way he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight or die again as in the tradition of vietnam war films full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti war film or not a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam as have others in the past this film in different ways also can be viewed as more powerful than others that again is up for debate and depends on your opinion one thing is for sure however no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to unfortunately many did 
i actually am a fan of the original or so live action disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins separated at birth by divorcing parents never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again and everyone should know how i feel about remakes especially of films i happen to enjoy my fallacy unless you re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up with a gasp new idea this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list and was actually quite the opposite contemporary live action disney films are not one of my favorties anyway they re usually unfunny alienating and a big fat bore at least to anyone over the age of and above the iq of this one however is shockingly not bad in fact it s actually good not the original good but what s great about it is that it doesn t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining because it s cute and innocent fun because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with because the lead star is immensely appealing because the parents are also immensely appealing and i m repeating myself because it s cute and innocent fun there s nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and it s aimed directly at either kids adults who want to remember the original or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid i personally am somewhere between the second and third i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn t so weird or diverse the names godard and kubrick weren t even a glimmer in my right eye back then when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc s wonderful world of disney where they d show you a live action and or made for tv disney flick an hour per week i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly i remember every single christmas without fail there were a barage of children s animated half hour shows made exclusively for the christmas season that i wouldn t dare missing i can even remember seeing the made for tv parent trap ii on tv one night and after i had seen that one over and over and over again i saw the original parent trap it s more of a late childhood movie because it deals with the issue of divorce but it deals with it in a disney ized version it s playful and witty and charming and if i saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood i d probably dismiss it i d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn t seen the original at such a perfect age watching it i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly perfect parents splitting up and how it affected my adolescence and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fucked up of situations things could always work out if you well manipulate things a bit at least for the better this new version did that for me but it s also charming in its own way it has a new cast a contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for a live action disney flick a tone that isn t corny or condescending but just right the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way and for the first time since the original film the kids actually know better than the foolish adults the story is basically classic by now repeated almost as many times as kurosawa s the seven samurai a pair of twins played here by lindsay lohan just like they were played by hayley mills in the original are separated at birth by their divorcing parents one annie is sent to live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than i had ever noticed in london where she lives with her parents and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz as she works as a swingin fashion designer she grows up refined and classy but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker playing the other hallie is sent to northern california with her father dennis quaid to live on a vineyard with their pseudo maid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming they both meet at the same camp one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged they feud because they look all too similar and are thus in tight competition which results in some nasty pranks which winds them in seclusion together in a private out of the way cabin there they become friends then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent whom they ve only heard of they learn about eachother s lives in detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously ear piercing a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer comes they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan doesn t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original but she comes off just as appealing as she did once she does though add a couple new things she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also adds on an american and british accent to each one with one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake ones accents aren t exactly perfect she s also incredibly appealing not merely cute which is especially notable since this is her first feature film and we know how notorious child actors are especially in their first films she makes a great protagonist and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing dennis quaid in fact hasn t been this likable in about a decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past not just that he s mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasn t ever been this likable period the two make a winning couple maybe not so winning as maureen o hara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this film instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original during the opening credits we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother and when back together again the film s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraine inducing way as in many such films this all brings this new parent trap to a level of entertainment that hasn t really existed since well the original film years ago still my money the best live action disney flick of all time this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot a gold digging sharon stone type played by elaine hendrix who s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film a treat instead of a bore like the original this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it takes two starring the olsen twins because it treats the children as the smart ones and the adults as the silly ones not the other way around and because above everything it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew however in comparison with the original it could be a bit better certain scenes work well but not nearly as well as they worked in the original i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing a lesson extracted from the howard hawks cary grant films of yesteryear and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom compared to the original this film almost drowns in cutedom the original though not gritty was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences as such this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances 
the small scale film in limited release waking ned devine is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town filled with breathtaking scenery characters and delightful music the movie would be interesting even without a plot the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review the film starts out with a sharp opening which gives us a taste of what is to follow country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town pop of tullymore who that person is and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ian bannen and michael david kelly part detectives part scalawags they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds the village consists of several amusing characters a clueless pig farmer temporary priest and a witch there s also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up and up there are no hollywood touches to this film except for the outer space introduction pacing is right towards the end it runs a bit out of steam but that s okay because for most of the minutes we ve been interested in the goings on a mixture of laughs and occasional sentiment all the right emotions are engaged in one brief dream sequence you ll know it when you see it a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists one of the key moments in the film the music available on cd london follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering a fine film that s for everybody except action fans somewhat like the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain but livelier 
most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category but manages to be slightly unique the rocky formula of rocky loses fight rocky trains rocky wins fight is carried out to the letter also the tradition of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky sylvester stallone has become even showing a brief appearance on sesame street then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips hulk hogan a mysterious bad ass known as clubber lang mr t trash talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he pities the fool for not coming out and fighting him outright rocky s trainer burgess meredith tells rocky not to fight but the italian stallion doesn t listen naturally he gets his ass kicked somewhere along the line after this several things happen rocky s longtime trainer dies causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed rocky s wife complains to her husband that he should fight the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky guess who wins the winner s name rhymes with smocky the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang s over the top performance the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film which is good if you like fighting scenes the last match is quite decent actually if you liked the previous films rent this one it s well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series but if you can t stand rocky shouting adrianne one more time see something else 
tempe mills cinema az this movie had us in non stop stitches from beginning to end all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie if you thought they were funny see the rest of the movie it s hilarious how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head bopping on snl to exactly one song easy write an interesting script around tried and true ideas add some good lines and satire and voil you end up with an excellent well done very entertaining flick will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day at night they pursue their life long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills ca the only disco act worth going to the only problem the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door the roxbury closes all the while bearing witness to guys with one hundred dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss the script authors steve koren will ferrell and chris kattan cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury their flower shop van is rear ended by richard grieco who fears a law suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star struck to think about the car accident they just had but not about getting into the roxbury grieco happily takes them in even introduces them to the owner which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers elisa donovan and gigi rice who bet their time and bodies on will and chris what follows are some of the best slap stick dancing routines ever the music is superb and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez s born to be alive the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by for example the bee gees and their stayin alive it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will and chris don t have any mone y and dump both on the spot even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away an art imitates life poke at shallow women it s a scene that s an approximate parody of the vinegar s own rolf luedeke s editorial this week national organization for men nom replaces now ted unabomber kaczynski himself rejected for not having money will identify well with this scene if he ever watches the movie of course the script wouldn t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good looking disco blondes proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby nevertheless will s father wants him to marry molly anyway but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest quarter exile during the wedding ceremony will s heart isn t exactly into getting married and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head bopping music will thinks worse of the knot tieing idea and runs to chris definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony i found this scene a riot however it went over brandi s head she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries instead the step in buddy weight lifter who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy and who has been lusting for a good looker for a long time but ready now to take anyone more art imitates life stuff not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world the idiots mother is played by loni anderson whose barbie doll looks don t play well anymore she s a bit old and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in need of a lot of laughs go with a date brandi laughed non stop as i did and a deaf mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for minutes 
apparently director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film american history x i don t know the details of the fight but it seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether i ve heard about this kind of thing happening before and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce as it is i found american history x to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kaye s focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of a powerful charismatic performance from edward norton it s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton s fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself a star norton is one of those performers who becomes his character and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year he plays a young man named derek vinyard a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly d angelo and sister davin jennifer lien the film opens with a flashback in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car we find out that this lands him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny in the present time of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother much of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that leads to derek s adoption of white supremacy when derek is released having served three years in prison he finds that his brother is now a full blown skinhead derek however has given up the violence and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms it s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach but kaye has found the right note for his material because american history x is a mainstream film there has to be a redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic i partially disagree with this because although i do not advocate racism in any way it s interesting the way kaye presents derek he is a loud obnoxious man but he s also very smart the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men it s clear that he s passionate about his beliefs and that he s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up of course it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part it s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest in addition to getting the look just right he s perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and a whole lot of shouting and norton does it all with ease even when he s at his meanest derek has a likable quality to him and that s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny s school avery brooks becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny the other performances are all terrific with standouts from furlong d angelo and lien visually the film is very powerful kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices and most of them work nicely lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere but like a lot of movies lately american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes although the climactic scene is very moving the picture ends with a pretentious preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point it felt like a slap in the face to be hand fed a theme in such a simplistic way it makes me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film perhaps this last scene was the problem it s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good in a time when so many movies are timid and weak american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way 
bruce willis and sixth sense director m night shyamalan re team to tell the story of david dunne willis a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of to make things even stranger dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed a comic book art dealer named elijah price samuel l jackson who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child dunne doesn t believe him at first but price assists him in discovering his powers and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is writer director m night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years for shyamalan the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash though the answer to that question is not a very easy one either as far as pacing goes the sixth sense seemed almost interminable it wasn t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally and perfectly paced in order to give the audience ample time to re connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached for unbreakable shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which in many ways blows away the film that had come before the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan s direction is excellent with the camera almost constantly moving there are tons of great shots in the film not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis character and another train passenger the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak also very impressive is the film s score by james newton howard who also scored shyamalan s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes as well as this year s dinosaur several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to exercise his powers the music in combination with the stellar visuals really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year this one would be it the film also boasts some great performances including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne who just can t seem to figure out why he s been depressed for the last few years his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him but he eventually grows into his own under elijah s tutelage jackson is one of the better actors of our time and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah though his hairstyle is absurd jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked robin wright penn s role seems slightly underwritten but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again spencer treat clark as the dunne s young son jeremy shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film out of all the characters jeremy s is perhaps the most emotional and clark does a great job with the role where the film does lose points though is during its surprise ending shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense but i found myself saying that was it when unbreakable revealed its own ending it s not that the ending is bad it s just that the ending doesn t quite have the emotional punch that the other film s did plus it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels and i won t reveal the ending here but you ll understand what i mean when you see it essentially what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable the only real problem is that the ending doesn t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor as long as it isn t held to the standard that sixth sense set which it ultimately will be it should be a remarkably well liked film one thing seems clear though shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film 
it s not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts but that s just what happened to me at uhf weird al yankovic s big screen debut uhf is a television parody a la airplane and like airplane the movie is extraordinarily stupid but it s dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb it s so silly and outrageous it s hilarious the movie stars weird al as george newman a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination the type who fantasizes he s indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns george is basically a loser his daydreams and smart alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station george revives channel with innovative programming shows like wheel of fish and movies like conan the librarian as the station s ratings rise it comes into competition with channel the leading vhf network affiliate as r j fletcher channel s ill natured hard nosed owner veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy he really hams it up with his snorts grimaces and scowls uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television including game shows tabloid talk shows children s shows dizzy news women and movies everything from rambo to close encounters the funniest scene the one that made my head spin is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed like most movies in its genre uhf is hit or miss for every gag that works at least one fizzles for instance weird al s mock video of money for nothing by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt although it does have some nifty computer animation but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail we know another gut wrencher is on the way in fact uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane type movie since well since airplane much of the credit goes to weird al s exceptionally inventive script and to the movie s winsome cast weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning but because he s not afraid to look silly he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character the real standout is michael richards as stanley the dim witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children s show stanley spadowski s playhouse stanley s off beat mixed up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over night star he is an endearing mixture of good natured innocence high energy enthusiasm and puppy dog cuteness and above all he s a good janitor who adores his work another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips the cast also features gedde watanabe the chinese foreign exchange student in sixteen candles as the karate master who hosts the hit series wheel of fish also aboard for the ride is fran drescher who plays pamela finklestein channel s roving reporter unfortunately as weird al s girlfriend victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering whining and sulking her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether while uhf is not an absolute must see it s definitely the ticket if you re looking for a wild and zany whacked out comedy the movie is good enough to see in the theaters but it may work even better on television the very medium at which it pokes fun 
it s hard not to recommend the others the supernatural thriller written and directed by alejandro amen bar open your eyes adroitly establishes and maintains a low key atmosphere of menace the cinematography by javier aguirresarobe is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied overall the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old twilight zone episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented only to learn they are actually a child s toy a military test subject or a department store dummy watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter i always wanted to shout get on with it as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in the others my reaction was much the same set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii the story focuses on grace kidman who tends to her children anne alakina mann and nicholas james bentley and worries about her husband charles christopher eccleston a missing serviceman anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all doors protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time at the beginning of the film three servants mrs mills fionnula flanagan young mute lydia elaine cassidy and mr tuttle eric sykes an aging gardener join the family the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not to make matters worse the children are upset nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them that s essentially the whole story with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear earlier there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog the visuals in the otherworldly sequence courtesy of aguirresarobe are simply astounding i also enjoyed the presence of religion a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural grace is a christian and answers her children s questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper when mother is away though the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore just as real children do but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending the others sets out to be a classic ghost story but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist 
no matter what you suspect this isn t your usual action thriller the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up and coming director bryan singer it s one of those movies that after everything is revealed rapid fire at the end you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light plot twists a go go are what you get here i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me keyser soze is a name you ll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason it s not only the name of the mysterious and possibly even mythical crime boss in the movie it also sums up the movie keyser soze in latin means an intelligent crime mystery story from up and coming director bryan singer or maybe i shouldn t have bought a foreign language dictionary from the same company that makes those cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets at the movie s opening a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup including mcmanus stephen baldwin keaton gabriel byrne fenster benicio del toro buckney kevin pollack and verbal kevin spacey winner of the best supporting actor academy award symbol f times new roman s h for his performance in the movie verbal is so named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing he also earns his name as the movie s narrator spouting memorable lines like the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn t exist although obviously he does exist what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri any actor with multiple z s in their name is okay in my book we see the story unfold as spacey retells it the five felons upon being released from the lineup get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars and stealing all the money and drugs in the car it s a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze who sends a minion to them with an offer they can t refuse namely they have to destroy soze s main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship shooting a bunch of people burning all the drugs and stealing million cash spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent cripple character to life and baldwin byrne palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense keeping the viewer guessing until the very end and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv a different mystery i guess which may turn into a murder mystery if that video ever comes on again 
oliver stone s latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents it s a three hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the th century stone doesn t hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done at the same time he creates a very human character a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics which is here pictured as a wild animal he is simply trying to tame it but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president s ability to control them stone doesn t in any way apologize for nixon he blames not only nixon s own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself the system that once set in motion behaves with a mindlessness of its own nixon is a modern shakespeare story a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws there s something almost majestic about the process as nixon goes down in this film there is no gloating but a watery sigh as of a great ship sinking sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding creating a very emotional picture of the th american president joan allen s magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette she is strong and loyal as mrs nixon the rest of the cast is equally magnificent including james woods j t walsh paul sorvino ed harris and bob hoskins everyone does a serious and demanding job no one are disappointing stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy honest and determined he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon s youth and childhood the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin robert richardson s rich cinematography and john williams musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere the film s only fault is that it s a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers still it s an honest and captivating a solid piece of movie making 
 no man is an island one character quotes john donne in apt pupil effectively summarizing the movie s themes while hardly a great film singer s ambitious adaptation of king s short story is challenging nonetheless perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses wonder bred high school honours student todd bowden renfro conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the s and was never heard from again bowden suspects arthur denker mckellan the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby is actually a pseudonymous dussander much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd s theory bowden strikes a deal with dussander in exchange for not revealing his identity dussander must satisfy bowden s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams but like a bystander at a traffic accident todd s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his student among other things bowden who has taken on very hateful qualities he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook engages the veteran in an endless game of one upmanship dussander stands to lose his freedom and bowden his credibility in effect his post secondary school future all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable and unsettling conclusion one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material s excessive climax singer has yet to get keyser s ze out of his system his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence verbal s tics and todd s golden boy reputation are plausible ruses they showcase morally bankrupt anti heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome there was no way you could see the ending coming as it was all a hoodwink anyway thankfully singer has gotten most of the usual suspects film schoolish geek theatrics out of his system some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and or obvious the dream sequences were extraneous but the majority of the film is subdued and singer s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer in training mckellan s and renfro s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan s finely tuned realization i d like to single out renfro s daring work he isn t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold hearted he strips his character of vanity something many of his peers wouldn t do can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor thomas in the same role renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine i hope he doesn t continue down that path because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him as guidance counsellor edward french friend schwimmer also deserves mention he wants to be the parent to todd that todd s own well to do folks are not todd like most modern kids and only children has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger and his sincerity makes the apt pupil s blackening heart even more apparent but one of the film s ultimate questions are we born evil or do we learn evil might be answered in french whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous no man is an island indeed we all have the capacity to make the right or the wrong choices schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible october the excellent collection king s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil but the shawshank redemption originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption and stand by me originally titled the body 
have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally at any given moment in life or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world or outside of it these thought provoking questions are the subject of final destination which is the most riveting horror drama since s the sixth sense stylishly filmed and tautly directed by x files alum james wong the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters in accurately written teen speak rather than overwrought highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn t use all the while developing into a darkly foreboding severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less successful but still suspenseful epilogue at the start of the film year old high school senior alex browning devon sawa is about to leave with his student french class for a field trip to paris progressively getting a case of preflight jitters he spots several mysterious coincidences including the departure time being the same as his september birthday as well as hearing the john denver song rocky mountain high over the sound system in the airport bathroom john denver died in a plane crash alex grudgingly mutters to himself once seated alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff and after causing a ruckus onboard he as well as six other students and a teacher are thrown off arguing in the airport lobby alex s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight killing all passengers including the rest of their classmates as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode the fellow survivors whom he has saved treat him in varying manners carter kerr smith the hotshot jock holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate alex s best friend tod chad e donella wants to stand by him but can t because of his fearful parents the teacher mrs lewton kristen cloke is frightened by him believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker only outsider clear rivers ali larter who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life that is only the setup of final destination and the less said about what follows the better suffice to say the film does indeed turn into a slasher film albeit one that is more thoughtful than most and replaces a knife wielding maniac for the never seen granddaddy killer of them all the grim reaper itself the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes and final destination surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner they manage to occasionally be so intense you don t know whether to shrink down in your seat tap your feet in nervousness or turn away devon sawa a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in s underseen slasher comedy idle hands is even more of a charismatic presence here the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival which he comes to believe he wasn t meant to do as well as the loss of the other passengers is superbly and subtly acted on his part one scene in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful ali larter s varsity blues in the other central role is also effective as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man the exact opposite of her now deceased father the other roles are not as fully written and most remain rather one dimensional the movie is mainly sawa s however and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles tony todd s candyman as an arcane morgue attendant pops up for a five minute cameo but his appearance is rather supererogatory and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy ultimately what is so good about final destination is that within the confines of the slasher genre writer director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten two things that are rarely found in today s horror films if anything it s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again 
with a team of graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft s square pictures final fantasy inspired by the top selling game franchise is visually awe inspiring and groundbreaking no doubt you have never seen anything like this film and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting obviously the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail individual threads in the fabric individual strands of hair swaying wrinkles and pimples on skin incredible water effects overall the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue and the times when they don t sync perfectly really stand out since the animation is usually so dazzling but you won t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes as soon as you catch one the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering wow like the series of games final fantasy s plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind hironobu sakaguchi it s the year and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien phantoms whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors the often invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul for some unexplainable reason while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein james woods to blast the aliens with a zeus cannon dr aki ross ming na and dr sid donald sutherland plan to build a wave using eight collected spirits to counteract the phantoms and kill them off while the images serve the sci fi aspect of the film well the storytelling doesn t it s unfortunate because the plot seems so intricately thought out perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english except two americans wrote the screenplay nevertheless the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes why do these aliens feed on souls if they can pass through bodies and ships how can humans hurt them with guns what is so special about the spirits that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens worse yet the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science heavy star trek episode an installment of die hard or a sappy love story depending on who s doing the talking for the most part it s bearable considering the genre but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don t do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming who always has great cracks during tense moments but when the lights come up and the credits roll you re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked there s no question that the roughly million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film you d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more 
fritz lang s first american film since leaving nazi germany is an eye opener about a lynch mob in a small town joe wilson spencer tracy is a regular joe a hard working stiff a decent guy who is living with his two brothers tom walcott and charlie albertson in chicago he is engaged to katherine grant sylvia sidney but can t save up enough money to marry her she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher before she departs she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother sews up his ripped trench coat corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento and kisses him goodbye a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her he arrives at a near by town called strand but the deputy sheriff buggs meyers walter brennan comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl the sheriff ellis finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money and he fits the general description of the suspect locked in jail he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence in the local bar the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect a mob storms the jail burns it down and dynamites it when they can t get through to the prisoner s jail cell the sheriff called the governor for the national guard but one of his political advisers countermanded that request saying it wouldn t look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him somehow joe escapes but his dog rainbow dies katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell and becomes convinced that he died the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers who are startled to see him alive that he wants revenge he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the leaders in the lynch mob an ambitious district attorney walter abel prosecutes the for murder katherine not knowing he s alive remains in a state of shock but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death the defense claims that it can t be a charge of murder without a corpse the trial proves to be interesting as the citizens in this close knit respectable community lie under oath providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn t have been at the jail the sheriff also lies saying he can t identify anyone in the mob but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film as for proof of the corpse an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe in the note memento is misspelled which makes katherine realize that joe is alive when the sentence is announced of the accused are found guilty of murder but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened katherine forgives him and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have but don t blame lang for all the changes in the film of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive mgm couldn t bear to have it made the way lang wanted it that is by having tracy die in the lynching instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script to lang s credit even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised you couldn t help get the feeling that the citizens didn t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their vigilantes from going to jail even perjuring themselves their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren t going to be convicted lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed and the innocent jovial good guy seen in the beginning of the film has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience 
 the endurance shackleton s legendary antarctic expedition in as the great war descended upon europe sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica this time to be the first to cross the ice bound continent on foot men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years director george butler using film footage and photographs from the historic journey tells their remarkable story in the endurance shackleton s legendary antarctic expedition the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse on foot the vast wasteland of antarctica as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea the entry to the cold cruel continent they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed stranding the men on the flow propelling them away from their goal and eventually into their lifeboats for safety shackleton faced with a desolate situation made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island once on this safe haven shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the mile journey on the world s roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia miraculously the six land after days at sea on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous snow covered mountains covering miles in just hours this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen in the end he is successful and everyone made it back home alive only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war the title of this fascinating documentary the endurance is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived months of the toughest most grueling conditions on the face of the earth the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men with astonishing foresight shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men day to day life the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow after the sinking of the ship the remaining film stock with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world s harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his documentary south an interesting companion piece for the endurance if shackleton s original idea document his trek across the frigid southern continent had been successful it would have been considered a super human feat as you watch the story of the endurance unfold you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent shackleton s amazing mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself there are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work though actor liam neeson narrates the story but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material both film and photo in the documentary s first half as the crew s adventure takes more drastic paths hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks but the treasure of the endurance its film footage is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition i can t think of a true life adventure that shows better the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds the endurance based on caroline alexander s book is an eye opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and even more remarkably all survivors lived to tell about it i give it a b 
before even seeing a single frame of the film it would be easy to snicker at deep impact in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet it is the latest entry in this decade s dubious revival of the s disaster film and the first of two the sky is falling flicks to hit screens this year the other being this coming july s armageddon in which a meteor is the threat its tagline oceans rise cities fall hope survives is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight they came in alone the only way out is together but it s every bit as treacly the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions such as the usual opening roll call in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced the most prominent of the personal stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner tea leoni who is distraught that her father maximilian schell left her mother vanessa redgrave for a younger woman rya kihlstedt what is just as snicker worthy is how this co venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high profile corporate collaboration microsoft and nbc s cable news network msnbc which employs jenny who is the film s ostensible main character in the vision of america presented here msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante s peak but there s one thing about deep impact i underestimated the skills of director mimi leder she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc s smash er which is essentially a weekly disaster movie each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold to make the audience care for these guest characters regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are and powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy handed or overly melodramatic having passed the er challenge in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen as the countdown to impact progresses the ominous feeling of doom is palpable leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension there s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects situations that initially feel contrived such as jenny s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner leelee sobieski and comet discoverer leo biederman elijah wood achieve some poignance and even the more vaguely drawn characters including u s president tom beck morgan freeman astronaut spurgeon fish tanner robert duvall and his rather faceless crew ron eldard jon favreau mary mccormack blair underwood and alexander baluyev aboard the comet bombing spacecraft messiah have their share of touching moments the latter fact owes a debt to the actors who all do a solid job and are well cast with the possible exception of leoni she delivers a decent performance but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister it is the first of the s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true a film that makes a genuine impact even if it isn t as deep as hoped 
the verdict spine chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king featuring an outstanding oscar winning performance from kathy bates geez french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this sorry non british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders my apologies the pair are british comediennes jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in absolutely fabulous who did a series of film spoofs a few years back including alien the exorcist and misery needless to say amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates the resemblance was quite uncanny dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder s legs but despite the lingering memory of their sketch and although i ve now seen the film a couple of times now that hobbling scene was no less disturbing i m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion that may be the most memorable scene but it s certainly not the only worth watching stephen king whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale it s a nicely crafted psychological horror which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon james caan rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes bates who introduces herself as the writer s number one fan he soon becomes her prisoner both the script and kathy bates beautifully masterful performance for which she won an oscar work arm in arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit cake or is that fruity as a nut cake bates relishes her demanding role and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour at times she s a rather tragic character and more often than not she s just damned scary this is basically a very simple tale but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity it s an involving engrossing experience and considering it s basically a two hander mainly set in one locale it s a remarkable piece of cinema there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences this one relies solely upon rob reiner s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan oh i haven t really mentioned caan yet he does a good job as the writer who s a prisoner of his own success annie is obsessed with him and his books but as you no doubt gathered from the above bates is well and truly the star of the show along with the pig of course anyway the tension is built up with masterful aplomb and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense there s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve shattering lengths to poison her wine he succeeds but she knocks the glass over i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well in the immortal words of homer j simpson d oh other nerve wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house we cut to annie in her car she s on her way home he realises this and tries to get back to his room cut to the car again she s getting near will he make it ok so these sequences aren t exactly original nor perhaps unpredictable but they work boy do they work if a film has you on the edge of your couch biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense then it s doing something right of course the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned hobbling annie realises her captive has been out of his room and she s going to stop him once and for all cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer and i feel ill just thinking about it nasty it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho and then we re given one of the most ridiculously over the top fight scenes i ve ever seen she gets hit over the head with a typewriter set on fire head smashed against the wall and she just won t die sheldon isn t in terribly good shape either if it weren t so gorey it would almost be laughable but it s a terrifically effective film and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked misery is a tight tense intense and chillingly entertaining thriller the directing is first rate and the performances bates in particular contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem wonderful stuff for more regularly updated film and tv reviews check out my site http www geocities com hollywood bungalow 
 well this is not mission difficult mr hunt it s mission impossible difficult should be a walk in the park for you agent swanbeck sir anthony hopkins the series new agent phelps takes ethan hunt tom cruise down a notch a russian scientist rade serbedzija has created a new virus and its antidote called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection a rogue imf agent sean ambrose dougray scott wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause posing as ethan hunt ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff hall thandie newton to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods ethan and nyah fall quickly in love but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose s reluctantly he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah although the first mission impossible film was a moderate box office success audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn t much action although being a fan of the series both old and new i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry robert towne and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo the end result is one of the most entertaining yet simple action films made in a long while unfortunately the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah s quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission impossible tv series ethan s conflict is a compelling one but it seems very rushed and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close ups the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film thankfully though at the point ambrose discovers nyah s deception mission impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action packed robert towne s screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus after that the action scenes just begin to build in intensity as is the case with many of woo s previous high octane films the final half hour is an all out assault of action a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer unfortunately as far as summer entertainment goes mission impossible ii is serviceable fare anyone looking for hardcore action won t be disappointed except for during the first half of the film perhaps even if you weren t a fan of the first film this entry deserves some checking out pg 
sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest some people call it original or artsy or abstract some people simply call it trash a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings definitely a generation x aimed movie a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke based musical dream sequence whew anyone in their s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film it s somewhat silly it s somewhat outrageous and it s definitely not your typical romance story but for the right audience it works a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting well sorry folks but i haven t seen trainspotting so i can t really compare whether that works in this film s favor or not is beyond me but i do know this ewan mcgregor whom i had never had the pleasure of watching definitely charmed me he was great cameron diaz s character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp the audience may find it difficult to care about her thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him misguided you bet loveable you bet a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city utah this was just one more thing i didn t know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise but i think even if i had known i would have been just as happy a life less ordinary is quirky eccentric and downright charming not for everyone but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies 
jacques tati s classic les vacances de m hulot also known as mr hulot s vacation in english ought to be the textbook on how to do non dialogue comedy in film the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly and the film operates on the paper thin premise that monsieur hulot played by tati himself is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week s vacation yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don t watch where they re going in les vacances de m hulot the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low key in one sequence for example hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when while his back is turned the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves washes away then comes back up on the other side of the boat while crossing over to get the can hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it when he actually takes the boat out into the water it breaks in half but the two halves flip up against each other trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues tati doesn t waste a single opportunity for humor scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience s expectations and les vacances de m hulot succeeds brilliantly in that area as well tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume no fights or shouting matches ensue instead the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark tati also uses running gags to this effect allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would more often than not we can see them coming and think oh he s not going to do that again but lo and behold he does for example there is a recurring joke in which hulot s noisy sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel s lights coming on one by one then this image turns up again in the finale which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four star film as opposed to merely an above average clever comedy as much as i was laughing during this film i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience suffice it to say that he did the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him alternatively it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons instead tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them however strange or irritating they might seem les vacances de m hulot is not subtitled but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store note les vacances de m hulot was not rated by the mpaa it would at most receive a pg rating 
weir is well respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject matter into deceptively simple powerful films the mosquito coast utopia and fearless post traumatic stress disorder among them in the truman show weir essentially breathes life into the now tired concept of media manipulation by tackling the material from the inside out it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top form playing the title character truman burbank by now you must be aware of the premise unbeknownst to him truman carrey is the star of his own tv series a peep show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants seahaven his hometown and the show itself are the brainchild of christof harris who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon directing over cameras and hundreds of actors and extras for years truman suspects nothing we accept the reality we re given poses christof but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in fiji mcelhone who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement overwhelms him thus christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly rated program in a few broad strokes weir creates a convincing second reality and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three quarters through this allows us to comprehend and accept truman s world before we contextualize it for all his madness christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be well so darn nice like a sibling or perhaps more appropriately a caged animal in an interactive zoo they want to see him succeed the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey he really is an everyman here abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible wide eyed bewilderment cinematically the truman show is impeccable stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images as well it employs wojciech kilar s piece zycie za zycie masterfully and beautifully if the film has any flaws one may find them in laura linney s characterization as meryl truman s wife i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone and in a subplot involving truman s father which feels curiously incomplete there are a few stupendous sequences and the film pulls off a wonderful trick we become truman s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film they wear buttons asking how will it end i couldn t wait to know myself though i didn t exactly want it to end for this inspired movie is possibly the best and most complex summer picture in years 
let s say you live at the end of an airport runway large jetliners continuously pass over your house rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace let s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home now let s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway and offers you more than it s worth wouldn t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed of course you would but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise and the house your castle that s what they are to darryl kerrigan michael caton and although he s happy that a multi national corporation would like to buy his home sorry it s not for sale unfortunately the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice not about to take this lying down darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto tiriel mora and makes a determined albeit pathetic attempt to fight back the castle an australian comedy by rob sitch is perhaps one of the simplest movies i ve seen in recent memory yet also one of the funniest in fact it is this film s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful the good guys and the bad guys are clear the humor is straightforward and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets it s the perfect setup for a relaxing hilarious good time and as much as i hate to admit it i liked the fact that i didn t have to think all that much while watching this film i just sat back and enjoyed myself the situation is one we ve seen before regular joe fights back against the government or big business or whatever what makes this film different is its characters darryl thinks he s got the best life in the world he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal anne tenny and he swells with pride when his son dale stephen curry digs a hole in the yard steve kerrigan anthony simcoe constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for investments like jousting sticks and overhead projectors while wayne kerrigan is in jail as a result of dennis denuto s incompetent courtroom maneuvers the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren t so stupid that they get annoying they re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing we look upon them with a little bit of pity but a whole lot of affection screenwriters sitch santo cilauro tom gleisner and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans sympathy for their situation the laughter they bring us and the family s wonderful characterization simple as it may be leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans but trust me it works i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs don t get me wrong slapstick when executed well can be genius it s just that too often a film will resort to it s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience not always successfully instead the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world when they are by themselves the are funny and when they are with normal people they are hilarious one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film s running time luckily it s a funny little detour that while slightly distracting from the film s main drive is still quite enjoyable with all the levity abound in the castle the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes i m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution of australia and certainly sounds impressive at any rate and for that matter it s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this 
scream has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well during a film class discussion windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are and why sequels never live up to the originals a few rare exceptions are noted but they left out one scream s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america a sequel was unavoidable but luckily the re teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment in fact at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream i would say that scream might even be the better film sidney prescott neve campbell the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro ca in the original scream is now two years older and off to college majoring in theater meanwhile tv journalist gale weathers courtney cox who covered the murders in the first film has since written a book about the dreadful events a book titled stab which has been developed into a major motion picture as scream opens a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of stab and before long a young couple are butchered to death unnoticed in the midst of hysteria this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown copycat sets out to repeat what s been done and finish what hasn t of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film and yes movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds but this is a sequel and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies this is in large part due to williamson s deliciously written script which will easily leave you satisfied as much as the film condemns the use of cliches it is riddled with them but it is done so effectively and with skillful direction by craven that you re not bound to complain i will note however that the whodunit did wind up being the first person i suspected but believe me i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie all the actors outdo themselves here we re not talking oscar performances but cambell cox david arquette as dewey riley and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing the characters remain true to their roots and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years we can see how the events in the first film has affected them but we don t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place the nice thing about scream is that it doesn t seem off kilter from it s predecessor it s a natural smooth and believable as far as horror films go transition from film to film we skip two years but there doesn t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks it flows so well that you feel more like you re reading chapter two of a book long chapters eh than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels scream s entire plot structure correlates completely with the first making for immediate fondness and absorption as i said before scream easily lives up to if not surpassing it s precursor the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream is because it was the first this doesn t mean that it overcasts the unique whimsical humor or overall caliber of it s sequel it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it s own while maintaining it s sought after qualities if ever a film followed it s original so well it would be scream and it makes this a definite must see for all those unbridled scream fans out there scream fits snugly alongside scream and will hopefully receive as many high remarks it would top off the series quite well if it weren t for the fact that two movies don t really make a series it s unlikely to assume that a scream won t appear in the next few years but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror trilogy let s hope they can keep up the fantastic work like they say don t mess with perfection but when a money making smash hit is almost guaranteed who s gonna listen 
towards the middle of the sweet hereafter a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend careens through the steel guard rail and disappears out of sight then in long shot we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow covered field it pauses for a moment before the field cracks under the bus weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment a single smooth second of time compare that scene if you will to the last eighty minutes of titanic when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise and you ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films the scene in the sweet hereafter epitomizes all that s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan s film it s not sensational we don t see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming terrified children being bloodied and battered about the bus doesn t explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake it s a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance using a non linear approach to his narrative egoyan shifts back and forward in time connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy fourteen children died in the accident leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit stephens who doesn t believe in accidents functions as a concerned involved observer scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath while stephens initial drive may be financial one third of the total settlement if he wins his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss his self destructive drug addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics halfway houses and detox units for years egoyan s attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry mychael danna who composed the shimmering music for the ice storm contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles equally impressive is paul sarossy s cinematography capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room the sweet hereafter while undeniably grim urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go it s a film of generous subtlety and emotion
