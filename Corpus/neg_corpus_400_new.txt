lauded as a genius by many stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically acclaimed films as a space odyssey a clockwork orange lolita and dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb now sadly he s added eyes wide shut to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near flawless copybook kubrick alas should have quit while he was ahead this much publicized psycho sexual tease a thon with its star billing of real life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman is nothing more than one long two and a half hours long boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut kubrick faithless to arthur schnitzler s novella dream story has confused eroticism with nudity he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly he has confused profundity with pretentiousness in addition the director has made some strange casting choices leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out pollack the director of such box office hits as tootsie and out of africa is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he s miserably out of his depth and there isn t much depth to begin with unhappily there s not likely to be a director s cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one in fact with the exception of the stark black and white credits snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack and many many grainy tracking shots down lavishly decorated corridors there s none of kubrick s trademark brilliance in this film it doesn t help that the story as delivered is ridiculous cruise and kidman who bring little more than marital torpor to the project play well to do new yorkers bill and alice harford he s a doctor and she s an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler pollack alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy irons like hungarian who s singularly determined to get her in the sack bill too is seen arm in arm with a couple of models before he s pulled away to deal with an overdoser back home bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice s aggressive jealousy kicks in as retribution she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black and white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman it s all way too much for him for revenge bill almost has sex with a hooker he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store then he almost does the hooker s roommate and he s almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious password protected party where everyone wears masks and the women are incredible i e naked this erotic set piece a cult ish bacchanal complete with chanting incense and lots of strategically placed partygoers covering up the dirty might impress the likes of hugh hefner but it s a lot less shocking than it s intended to be what s the big deal bill doesn t exactly do anything other than throw his money and credentials around and alice only ever lusted in her heart whoop dee doo still they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace was kubrick notorious for multiple takes paying them at an hourly rate even geniuses have their bad days eyes wide shut just happens to be kubrick s bad day an unerotic disappointing and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career 
sometimes when i decide to write a short story or a poem i think of a title first and then think of a subject to go with it it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence i wouldn t be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it the title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before the picture even began of course my attention dwindled shortly into the film disturbing behavior like so many thrillers starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous it s a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex it s a suspense film with no suspense it s an evil small town story with no story to speak of it s a disaster a listless and uninspired disaster that just barely misses one stardom because of a few good sequences a mercifully short running time and one terrific set of opening credits our main man is a fellow named steve clark blandly played by jimmy marsden he moves to a small town with his family after tragically his brother shoots himself steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother we learn this through strange home video like nightmares that he has occasionally the big trial for steve is of course to fit in at school and make new friends marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject as a social reject he falls in with some pretentious dope smoking philosophers gavin nick stahl and rachel katie holmes gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks known as the blue ribboners are actually a bunch of zombies assimilating new members into their group while sporadically killing innocent people so it s up to our group of mismatched protagonists to solve the mystery and do something about it by the end of it all something has happened and things have been explained but the film still doesn t make any sense disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg i ve seen his name around recently he was one of the toucher uppers on the armageddon script and i imagine that for the most part he knows what he s doing when it comes to screenwriting he did however have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film and then decided to actually take the time to write it out evil small town films are pretty common the last one phantoms is also a dismal failure but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work rosenberg s script is a complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization and it makes no sense nor is their any purpose when things are finally explained there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks but the film never explains exactly what is happening they get strapped to chairs a microchip is inserted into their eyes and poof they become sex crazed superviolent machine like creatures the doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the film much of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act in one terrible scene gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques while pointing them out in the cafeteria up front i should say that in four years of high school i did not eat in the cafeteria even once that aside the various social groups he points out are general uninteresting and poorly shown for instance he points to the nerds who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops it s such an obvious cliche that i can t believe rosenberg even bothered most of the dialogue is forced no one says bite me anymore and none of the scenes have any degree of wit this picture is not inspired and most scenes flop from one to the other with no sense of momentum or energy the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently likes his films dry horror films should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid there are a few good scenes though such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the film for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn i also liked the school janitor character played by william sadler he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought provoking the acting is largely a waste of talent marsden is as i said bland thought not particularly bad bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted stahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction isn t good enough to hone in on their skills stahl s performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cut outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn t all that cool disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film and it started out a wreck before shooting even began i m surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film or that it would make a lot of money at the box office it s not boring or even blatantly awful but it s an uninspired lump of a film it sure starts off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable so if you go to see this film take my advice appreciate the credit sequence and pray it never ends 
if there s one thing i just can t stand it s a film that oozes with sentimentality here s a note to all film makers films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves swelling saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy and that the situation is hopeless alas my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up what reminded me was that i wasn t choked up or even the slightest bit moved for that matter my giant is a forced contrived and conspicuously un cute i detest the word cute but i ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a cute film here it takes a premise that might have been interesting i liked the preview and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience maybe it will work for some people it didn t work for me billy crystal plays sam cayman an agent who at the beginning of the film is in romania he s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired get in a car accident and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall his name is max gheorghe muresan and sam thinks he d be a great movie star because of his size subplots are as follows sam has a son and a wife kathleen quinlan and he s never around for them so they move to chicago max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money and so their various subplots can all be resolved sam is broke max is dying pass the kleenex my giant as a comedy is only moderately funny it has its moments the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself in one great scene sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal of course his son doesn t believe that he s actually speaking to seagal and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect crystal is always entertaining and he has a few good lines here some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely often however he s countered by a slew of jokes that aren t funny and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes muresan is kind of fun to watch but he just can t act very well quinlan on the other hand is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff here the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that for much of its running time is simply mediocre as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings sam s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family later it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam s reunion with his family and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing but i had a few morality problems with it and i apologize for being vague it s icky it drips with gooey wannabe human emotions my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film more importantly it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is instead it s a complicated overlong and under engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears and since it left me feeling completely unmoved i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world

nostalgia for the s continues as we see a revival of one of the decade s greatest achievements the marijuana comedy however half baked doesn t quite run with all its brain cells and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more the plot follows the misadventures of four ne er do well stoners there s the group s unofficial leader thurgood david chappelle scarface guillermo diaz brian jim breuer and kenny harland williams kenny gets into trouble when while on a munchie run feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse when the animal keels over he finds himself accused of killing a police officer and facing a bail his friends promise to raise money for a bail bond but have no idea how that is until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson clarence williams iii for a comedy the film is pretty humorless not that it doesn t try it s just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat the four leads are nearly all playing the same character only williams stands out while still performing on the level of his humor free comedy rocket man but that is because he s imprisoned throughout most of the film giving a much needed change of pace but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another to help out the film is packed full of cameos steven wright tommy chong janeane garofalo willie nelson snoop doggy dogg and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another none of them work beyond the simple hey that s level in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle not as his bland pothead lead but in his second role as a pot obsessed rapper sir smokealot granted it s pretty much a one joke role and there aren t a ton of laughs but this film needs every one it can scrape up to top it off and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film thurgood is given a love interest mary jane rachel true her role is that of the public service announcement to inform us why doing drugs including pot is wrong her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the your film promotes the use of drugs camp the film would have been better off by sticking with the rebel tone it so eagerly tries to claim yet in the end it doesn t really matter watching the film clean and sober you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is 
the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into heartbreakers ray liotta s character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office while scrambling to collect himself he frantically shouted to her just wait a sex er i mean sec i was struck by a wave of revulsion thinking geez didn t lines like that die when three s company was canceled over the next few minutes as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous i realized that the mindset behind heartbreakers predated three s company suddenly i had an out of body experience as my internal way back machine swept me to the mid s all across america the counter culture was growing like wildfire but there was scant evidence of it on tv while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts on another channel dean martin made wisecracks about booze and broads and peter lawford decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket purred suggestive one liners as he ogled the go go dancers the adults laughed and laughed heartbreakers reeks of that stagnant mentality from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt s vah vah voom breasts to its leaden screenplay which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex obsessed to realize they are being manipulated in addition to liotta and hewitt the cast includes sigourney weaver gene hackman jason lee nora dunn and anne bancroft i can t imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the s if so they were sadly mistaken the story revolves around a mother daughter con team it opens with the marriage of max weaver to dean liotta a new jersey chop shop operator having withheld sex until the honeymoon max pretends to pass out on their wedding night the next morning she feigns illness sending a very horny dean off to the office where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary just as the two are about to get overtly physical max bursts into the room and catches them the horrified bride dissolves the union garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way of course the secretary was really her daughter page hewitt and the whole thing was a set up the women move on but an irs agent bancroft catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes in desperate need of funds max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam their mark this time is william b tensy hackman in hideous make up a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking max starts to put the game into action but page is so repelled by the old man and angry with her mom that she slips off to enact her own score targeting jack a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune complications arise when page realizes that good natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart as if that wasn t enough dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior a fish called wanda i won t bother to compare the two suffice to say that everything done right in wanda is done wrong here heartbreakers is soulless inept and at minutes at least a half hour too long sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters gene hackman is utterly wasted in a one note one joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich but only a bit the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince while doing half assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue bear in mind though that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points if you remember bob hope specials with fondness this might be your cup of tea as for me i m going to watch a fish called wanda now and try to forget i ever saw heartbreakers

capsule silly and inane adaptation of gibson s short story which is nowhere in sight gibson s script only adds insult to injury johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie i say awesomely because it s one thing to fail but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged keanur reeves who is terrible stars as johnny an information courier who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head he is given one last job whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words run which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories but it s only followed up on in a token fashion for his trouble johnny gets chased by the yakuza who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high tech thrillers what s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made in japan there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics but of course there s no room in this movie for any of that the yakuza are simply used to point guns wave swords flaunt tattoos and grimace menacingly i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies bound by honor sugar hill and american me come to mind when asians remain perpetually stereotyped but that s another essay anyway johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark why newark maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york that s why there he meets an assortment of odd characters ice t dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture it turns out what else that the data in johnny s head could save a lot of people but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn t kill him handled right this could have been absorbing but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other better movies blade runner and brazil come to mind everything looks run down and scummy everyone dresses like they re punk rockers and videophones are commonplace snore the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un technical fellow would think it would look and behave like a hacker of johnny s caliber would be blasting away with one command line function after another instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms but of course that s not cinematic whatever what went wrong with this movie gibson wrote his own screenplay which i guess is part of the problem what works as a short story doesn t work in a movie his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn t advance it convulses from the script on out it was probably all downhill renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless there s no fun in kicking a wounded dog is there 
at the outset of swordfish john travolta s gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today basically he says it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers how ironic as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture swordfish is loud violent and amoral it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life and how does travolta s gabriel plan to do this by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out terrorize terrorists swordfish is a very cynical movie it relies on an audience s perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non human faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration the movie s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down you d actually see how ridiculous it all is this is a live action road runner cartoon moving so quickly that it s over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson hugh jackman recruited by gabriel to crack the government s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti terrorist campaign talk about whacked out patriotism my objections to swordfish are many the body count is high but that is expected in a movie of this sort it s becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers police officers and government agents blown to bits another example is the family dynamics between stanley his year old daughter and his ex wife stanley though having served time in prison for hacking is shown as a loving and caring father forbidden by his ex to see his little girl audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband s adult films thus when she is found murdered late in the movie neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve in fact subconsciously many in the audience are probably glad she was killed then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich in recent films there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on screen victims as well yea it s only make believe but that doesn t mean you have to tolerate it travolta is cool deadly charming and flamboyant as the near crazy gabriel his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face off jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel s assistant while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger than life character in gabriel viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain and maybe that is the movie s underlying flaw there is no real hero to speak of only those doing their upmost to survive and that is not enough this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water 
the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride and it s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year s finest films so naturally when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found this notion left me puzzled it is a rare thing for a children s movie to be praised this highly so wouldn t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly magical piece of work a tad bewildered but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films i sat back for minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind having great expectations for the film looking back i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater believe me i wanted to like babe pig in the city the plot seemed interesting enough after the events that took place in the original babe the sheep pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon but after a fateful encounter with a water well arthur hogget james cromwell who the movie could have used alot more of has been rendered bed ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially the only solution that his wife magda szubanski going from delightfully charming to downright annoying can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair i think and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public problem is the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded city a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion setting the main plot in motion mrs hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright here is where the film took a wrong turn up until this point i had being having a rather enjoyable experience the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs hogget is accused of smuggling drugs unfortunately the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel none of them being even one tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe the main topic of discussion surrounding babe pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children and i believe it is at one point a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown at other times we are treated to surrealistic flash backs to mrs hogget s full cavity search at the airport in fact the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing however that is as they say neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half let alone entertain a child another problem i found with the film was it s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story if you re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel fine it may not be my cup of tea but at least it is a noble ambition but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs hogget swinging from wall to wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls it just didn t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining and the same goes for the rest of the movie 
there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong worded attack on a group of stoic doctors when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture you see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it and i actively hate it now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories i hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyac s shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey the badness of patch adams is stupefying it s confounding i can t believe a film can be this bad and yet it s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make in the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human in the beginning of the film patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn t want to kill himself while there he notices that the doctors don t care about the patients and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings so patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients he goes to medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that it s good to help people he also meets carin fischer monica potters the anti male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor naturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants to thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams so patch decides that he s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have and that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of on a superficial level the film is not particularly bad i wouldn t say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for i actually liked potter s performance even if she is wasted but the film fails fundamentally in execution every scene swells with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard take for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting on a bus we don t know patch yet but there s sad music and it s supposed to make us really sad that he s sad later on patch makes a lot of progress he helps a dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively and when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions real drama is character based you grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it we don t ever grow to know the dying patient he s simply a vehicle for patch s greatness real drama doesn t seem forced or present just to make the audience cry that s why patch adams is not real drama it goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman s sickening musical score sentimentality like this is indeed bad but it s not as bad as half baked simplistic themes you see patch is a really great student he aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think he s cheating but patch doesn t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor why don t we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds well patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort most of us have to study and a doctor who really wants to help but doesn t know a toe from a finger probably won t be too successful in preventing death oh wait i almost forgot the point of doctors is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life yes that is true and you can not do that without studying you can not do that without going to medical school what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later follow the rules bah who needs the rules only uptight doctors follow the rules the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants and then there s the free clinic issue which i find shockingly frighteningly idealistic a free clinic in the middle of the forest where patients can be taken to be helped for free how will patients be transported to the free clinic will it have an emergency room or is it just for mental patients and who may i ask will pay for it the film does give some token attempts to question patch s motives i think another character asks him how he s going to pay for it in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly don t explore or challenge patch s ideas to any meaningful extent reader please understand this i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams i know nothing about him if his beliefs mirror those of this film character then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them but regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony and in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch does a lot of shouting actually robin williams does a lot of shouting he shouts a lot about helping people and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words i won t tell you that you can t be moved by his words because i too was moved by his words i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be patch adams is the cheapest of them all 
writers dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer starring jamie lee curtis william baldwin donald sutherland joanna pacula sherman augustus marshall bell cliff curtis julio oscar mechoso i suppose i m not extremely surprised that virus comes to us from a deciple of james cameron john bruno and if i strain real hard i could even say that it s an obvious given particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr cameron s early works in fact virus is yet another in the long line of action horror paranoia thrillers from the aliens vein a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally threatening entity is out to get them a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies and maybe even to the first pictures albeit redeveloped by cameron in his blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future no such thing will happen to bruno whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature while bruno may have studied under cameron s wing for years and years i m beginning to wonder at what capacity and what exactly did he learn from him in fact virus should at least be mediocre the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron a director who if anything just knows how to make a movie and then make a film like virus is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z grade schlockfest of a film albeit a z grade schlockfest with a respectable budget the film seems to not only borrow it s plot from last year s similarly fated deep rising but also from a clunkish b movie from the s called leviathan an underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part alien part john carpenter s twisted remake of the thing virus again has a similar uh selling point a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water they get on they break up into pairs and investigate and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy has taken over all the machines on board have meshed the machines with parts from corpses and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ha ha not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond ian opening the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir destroying any of the suspense in what could happen but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters of its motley crew it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper a masculine potential romantic interest a drunken captain a black technician a tatooed aborigine a manic russian survivor and a couple other candidates for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin plain piece of writing paper and it s not the traditional argument for films like these where you may in fact want them all to be eaten even aliens played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers but this was more of a plus side for the film as a whole than the opposite instead as another cliche goes you just don t give a damn i almost don t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par to horrific the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is and she is just not really here and the latter being and it pains me to say this as he s a particular favorite of mine donald sutherland who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance of which he should be ashamed like anthony hopkins for legends of the fall the line scrooooooo em has been thus embroidered upon my membrance or peter o toole in caligula great actor horrific performance it happens every now and then and it only helps sutherland s career that no one except for an elite few even bothered to see this film though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can read early january when everyone s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominees it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film it s laden with complex machinery boasts respectable production design and it may even feature believable special effects if of course i or anyone else could see them virus mostly takes place on a large abandoned cruiser and mostly at night until the dawn and mostly without the use of lights not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey but more so because as the hollywood cliche seems to go if it s dark enough then the special effects will be more believable and if you don t believe me go back and rent godzilla and tell me if there s even one shot where we see godzilla either a in his entirety in one wide shot or b n the light so that we can at least see him well you don t really have to sit through it again just take my word for it but all of this doesn t matter since virus is basically just one loud cluttered mess of a movie the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i ve ever seen my um favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves rain and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned well i must say thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn t figure it out when i saw it imagine the first attack of the aliens in aliens shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity and that s basically the whole of virus one horribly directed action scene after the other capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members and my god it s a long damn sit with no interesting characters no dramatic urgency no tension not one good moment of action and no mesmerizing visuals it s a wonder that it even got made we already know that big movie studios mentality is shallow at best and movies like out of sight and saving private ryan give you more faith in them but movies like virus manage to drain a little more out of the pool i almost wish that instead of making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light they read the script they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack and he is and they still went ahead with the project only to have bruno and company shit back in their face even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie i d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr bruno for making a movie that could be this bad in fact shouts of egad man what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway are not only justifiable but encouraged 
plot two teen couples go to a church party drink and then drive they get into an accident one of the guys dies but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life and has nightmares what s the deal watch the movie and sorta find out critique a mind fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea but presents it in a very bad package which is what makes this review an even harder one to write since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold mess with your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films and these folks just didn t snag this one correctly they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly so what are the problems with the movie well its main problem is that it s simply too jumbled it starts off normal but then downshifts into this fantasy world in which you as an audience member have no idea what s going on there are dreams there are characters coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparitions there are disappearances there are a looooot of chase scenes there are tons of weird things that happen and most of it is simply not explained now i personally don t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again i get kind of fed up after a while which is this film s biggest problem it s obviously got this big secret to hide but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes and do they make things entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime not really the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this so we actually figured most of it out by the half way point so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense but it still didn t the make the film all that more entertaining i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding i mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy okay we get it there are people chasing her and we don t know who they are do we really need to see it over and over again how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie apparently the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves and it shows there might ve been a pretty decent teen mind fuck movie in here somewhere but i guess the suits decided that turning it into a music video with little edge would make more sense the actors are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in a new neighborhood but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller who holds her own throughout the entire film and actually has you feeling her character s unraveling overall the film doesn t stick because it doesn t entertain it s confusing it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it oh and by the way this is not a horror or teen slasher flick it s just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since whatever skip it where s joblo coming from a nightmare of elm street blair witch the crow the crow salvation lost highway memento the others stir of echoes 
well what are you going to expect it s a movie about a big snake that eats people that s what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more instead i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me too anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river led by anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz and terri flores jennifer lopez the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives along the way they find poacher paul sarone jon voight and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda to simply say that this is the world s largest snake wouldn t be doing it justice since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide if this isn t a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers i don t know what is at the beginning of anaconda we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past but that seems to be more or less over now i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line but it ended up being a set up for nothing cale chokes on a deadly wasp don t ask me how that happens i don t know and is put out of action relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone s plan to capture the snake however this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle most bad characters are either annoying or stupid in this movie they re both since this description applies to all the characters except sarone it s hard to find someone to root for you re supposed to back the good guys but you really end up cheering for sarone because he s smarter than everyone else or maybe he s just not as dumb as everyone else at times i almost found myself rooting for the snake there are no standout performances here everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason no matter as in most monster movies the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway in most of the scenes the snake is computer generated and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real however the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences sometimes for example the snake just moves too fast it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall for crying out loud then there s another scene where the snake eats one of the characters and we see the snake s skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim s pained expression from within the snake s belly absolutely ridiculous a testimony to the film s bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is in a scene totally unrelated to anything else we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard one of the panther s eyeballs pops out eeeewwwww above and beyond the sick factor however this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed in films like these a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don t know about and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown in a case like that the showdown just ends up being a letdown when i saw the snake for the first time i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn t the real danger this one was just a decoy and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe no such luck okay maybe anaconda is actually a decoy and there s really a better movie waiting to make its debut 
when respecting a director you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect woody allen has made a couple less than good films and he s my favorite even martin scorsese hasn t had a perfect track record kevin smith after a smashing debut with the classic clerks stooped as low to sell out and make the dreadful mallrats i mean so far the only director who s made several films none of which have been bad is richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all which were great now i adore quentin tarantino his first two films were classic films the second one being one of the greatest films of all time but just wasn t that good of a year for him he made way too many tv appearances he mispronounced jackie chan s name on the mtv movie awards and he made this film he was also awarded an oscar so i guess that would be a grand exception robert rodriguez is also a great director not a brilliant one but a cool one i ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film so i can t comment on them but in this crap ensemble director s film all four give pitiful efforts pitiful for any director too now in all fairness ensemble director pieces never really work out i ve never seen all of new york stories but have heard the first two films by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap i saw woody s one which was hilarious but not totally up to par but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film exposition a simple one a bellhop ted the totally overdone tim roth who s a god and all but not in this one though he has a couple good moments is working on new year s eve for his first shift in an old fancy hotel he s the only one there again and he only has a couple rooms yet again the old bellhop the seemingly immortal marc lawrence who hated pulp fiction actually hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily as the night goes on he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile yea the short films are presented in order btw the missing ingredient writer director allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt this one starts it off horribly with no plot no intrigue and crap dialogue the situation is so terrible that it s physically painful to watch the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is gasp stuck inside some object in their hotel room the witch that was supposed to bring it ione skye calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it yeah that s what i said stupid plot inane characters who aren t interesting at all etc etc etc the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which in turn it wastes pitifully not even actually funny for a second my rating out of no stars the wrong man writer director alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at coming back who are playing sex games ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon but at least this has a bit of comedy in it just not that much and david proval has never overacted as much and it s pulp fiction producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window a masterpiece compared to the first one but still the misbehavers writer director robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek s navel nope luckily she s on the tv dancing so we get to see her surprisingly enough when i read the screenplay about a year before actually seeing it this one seemed to have the most potential it was fast paced funny and well funny but when i watched it it seemed anti climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once antonio overacts nicely and the two kids lana and danny are funny but as i said it moves slowly and in that way it s more painful than funny but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time oh the plot antonio is a supposed gangster assumed really who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife tomita go out to get drunk at a new year s party antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long but things go wrong it was okay the man from hollywood writer director quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again ironically this one could be considered the best for a bad reason it best represents what quentin has done with this film he plays chester a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row they re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn t light they also pay him a lot of cash this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it s campy tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves cause they ve had hits major or minor it took quentin to realize that but the thing is it doesn t seem like he realizes that if he did i d give this a good stars but this sucked it was anti climactic and the dialogue wasn t very good he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes that makes no sense it s cool for a while then he makes it uneven it s long and it s just not very good hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one conclusion what s the moral here if you ve made celebrated films don t do an ensemble piece they should have re watched new york stories and then stopped in their tracks none of these have any point to them and they re embarrassing to not only the writer directors but to the actors cause they re working with crap but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin s next directing job even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool from dusk till dawn which i found exhilerating i love quentin and i suppose it s good he made the man from hollywood because it makes him seem more realistic and not some god of cinema i seem to respect directors if they aren t gods and are actually human beings who make mistakes the man from hollywood is his big mistake and let s hope he doesn t return her continuously 
i ve heard it called jaws with claws and that s a fair summation of the plot though that tag line does little to quantify quality director stephen hopkins blown away predator and screenwriter william goldman maverick misery would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the th century they ve stacked the deck with two big stars val kilmer michael douglas a bigger production design beautiful photography by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music the movie doesn t make a lick of sense though either as an epic or as your basic boo fest in fact some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater the movie how about the three guys with rifles who trap a lion and then can t even hit the damned thing or the ham on wry acting of michael douglas who chews more scenery than the animals ever do or my favorite lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops 
i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews and in both instances he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon now i personally remember those films as a starring a major motion picture star b being funny c having great action sequences d great chemistry e decent character development hmmm okay now on to my review of chill factor plot a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex army general to propose a nuclear device to international prospects when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps they must keep it cool on ice and rush it over to an army base before the contraption ticks over degrees fahrenheit and kills millions of people critique speed on an ice cream truck is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one tone movie to its backers but unfortunately the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension filled original two hours of cinema is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film and the lethal weapon movies stood for this film is seasoned in cliches with plenty of badly written dialogue over the top acting from cuba gooding jr zero chemistry between the two leads and horribly tacky bad guys tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously written that we just had to crack up that and the formula for the film s script which followed the proverbial and you guessed it scenario and what about all those catchy hip names to get us to relate to the characters elvis and nighshift oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters and yes it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr got involved in this one week old blue cheese smelling project did they actually think that it would boost their careers or did they know that the script sucked but discounted any fall from grace knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall most probably the latter have you seen either fled or bulletproof well despite the slight differences in plot the essentials are basically the same here you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people having no choice but to work together to get somewhere hating each other at first but over time learning to respect one another as individuals yawn add to that the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black drive black cars and black vans and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head not too conspicuous eh call me a party pooper but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy this film just doesn t even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island do not a fun buddy action flick make show cuba the money everybody little known facts about this film and its stars this is not a little known fact or anything but damn is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great looking actor johnny depp skeet s real life nicknames include chester skeeter and mosquito he stands was born in north carolina and got married in to that sex kitten actress from clay pigeons georgina cates they own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs skeet has a long scar on his chest from open heart surgery done when he was to correct a ventricle defect actor cuba gooding jr was born in the bronx new york in he break danced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles he stands actress hudson leick who plays one of the bad guys girls in his movie is better known from her role as callisto on the popular tv series xena princess warrior this film reportedly had a budget of million i m not exactly sure where all this money went but it certainly did not register onscreen interestingly enough director hugh johnson who makes his big screen debut with this film was the cinematographer on the film white squall and the demi moore vehicle g i jane 
 showgirls is the first big budget big studio film to receive an nc rating and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence but if showgirls is any indication of hollywood s future the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values bad moviemaking showgirls is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas who collaborated on another shock value project s basic instinct follow the plight of a young woman teen tv star elizabeth berkley determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer it s a hackneyed premise to begin with so not surprisingly all of the stock characters are trucked out there s the demanding producer the loyal friend the bitchy competitor lest i forget the scummy club owner of course any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film s main attraction an endless parade of full frontal nudity unfortunately showgirls doesn t satisfy in this department verhoeven s slam bang in your face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic to make matters worse you ll be forced to sit through the movie s clothed scenes which don t cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground but if it s adult entertainment you want stay home and watch the playboy channel you ll be the wiser for it 
the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits the rationale is sound but in many cases of this and recent years the sequel is a shoddy product that s exposed for the cash milking vehicle it really is last year s speed and scream as well as this year s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory in some cases a sequel can even discredit its predecessor as with the latest neo slasher flick i still know what you did last summer whatever uniqueness the original might ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller julie james jennifer love hewitt and ray bronson freddie prinze jr are back from the original to star in i still know reprising their roles in typical fashion julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling out at the beginning of the movie leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson matthew settle will and julie hit it off and along with friends karla brandy norwood and tyrell mekhi phifer the foursome heads off to a radio station giveaway vacation in the tropics unfortunately things aren t so peachy once they arrive and with a regularity you could set your watch by the infamous fisherman muse watson is back with his hook it s another bloody showdown complete with cliffhanger ending there s not much that s original about i still know and with the market saturated by gen x thrillers like this one it s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel for die hard fans of the genre this will be required viewing material but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work but rather a tense string based score and manipulative editing the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point the whole reason the plot exists julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station is a dead giveaway lessening suspense and creating a hurry up and wait timing problem and whereas the killer s identity might ve been a question in the first movie it s almost a given here which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as the killer they re almost used to it and the performances show it not hewitt nor prinze nor brandy nor phifer give a decent show and so in the end it s left wide open for a third movie and most likely a brand new supporting cast god help us 
here s a concept jean claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie now if that isn t enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie i don t know what is all sarcasm aside it is certainly a different way to start a movie of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother so lucky us we get to see more of jean claude van damme works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives van damme is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after gets killed in france the remaining twin the french cop goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death once there he hooks up with his deceased brother s girlfriend played by natasha henstridge and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are jean claude s acting abilities don t seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie in other words just in case you missed the sarcasm his acting is worse than normal on the upside natasha henstridge is in this film and she does what she did best in species she gets naked sadly this is probably the high point in the movie she is actually a decent actress but didn t improve as much as i thought she would after species this is the typical van damme movie with jean claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents nothing new here and certainly nothing we haven t seen in every other van damme movie simply put there is absolutely nothing new about this movie it has a retread plot this isn t the first time jean claude has played twins he still can t act we all saw natasha s breasts in species although this is one repeat performance i m not complaining about this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in sub par

i ve always been a kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs great performances the minute i saw the trailer for this film i resolved to see it besides the fact that kline starred it looked like a hilarious film i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent however as i also thought wow if there s this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film oops i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo my name for our local multi multi plex the film began the film concerns an english drama teacher at a suburban high school named howard brackett he loves poetry and great literary works but his class is more interested in his famous former student played by matt dillon i d put in his name but my wife won t let me take notes during a movie and i ve forgotten it they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him brackett has been engaged to another teacher played by joan cusack for three years and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her the wedding however becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual kline spends most of the first two thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn t the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference his closest friends don t help matters bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party there are some genuinely hilarous moments one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows if you want to be surprised don t read i am going to reveal the ending instead of saying i do in front of his parents and most of the town and even some cameras he says i m gay this is where the movie in my opinion falls apart most of the humor in the film had come from kline s insistence that he was straight while at the same time loving poetry and being a senstivie guy dressing well and occaisionally acting prissy it reminded me of the effeminate heterosexual sketch from saturday night live it was funny it was sustainably funny and kline s performance made it doubly so however after the wedding the film drags on they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion but it then gets into the serious side of what he s done he reconciles with his parents and his friends some of which had turned on him there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time the scene with his mother and her friends which was hilarious seemed pointless and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless finally even though i am not catholic i found the scene with the priest to be condescending the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship proclaiming to brackett in the third person he s gay it got a chuckle from the audience but i was distracted by it and began to tire of the film by the time the wedding had come and gone i found myself hoping it would be over soon much like this review you are saying overall if i have to quantify it i say rising action gets and climax and falling action gets see it in economy time 
 jack frost is one of those dumb corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching this does not come as a surprise since the studio that made it is warner brothers who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other jack frost michael keaton is a struggling middle aged rock musician who loves his wife gabby kelly preston and year old son charlie joseph cross but doesn t spend nearly enough time with them when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas halfway there jack has second thoughts but on his way back home is in a car accident and dies switch forward a year christmas is approaching once again and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack s death when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack s spirit jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise frosty the snowman is a classic cartoon and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated but as a live action film it doesn t work at all after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established jack frost quickly goes downhill especially once the snowman comes into play since jack has been deceased for a whole year you would think there would be many questions to ask him such as what happens after you die or how does it feel to be a snowman but instead the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie the performances are respectable enough but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this michael keaton at least got off easy since he disappears after the first twenty minutes but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here i have always liked kelly preston she is clearly a talented charismatic actress but has never been given a good role in her life usually having to settle for a one dimensional supporting character as in s nothing to lose and addicted to love joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent in one of the only subplots that actually works due to its wittiness henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side however by the tried and true main plot at hand which is the sappy story of a father and son since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid cringe inducing lines of dialogue some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father you da man says charlie no i da snowman replies jack or how about this little zinger coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out snowdad is better than no dad do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this the snowman created by john henson s creature shop is more believable than the snowman from last year s unintentionally hilarious direct to video horror flick also called jack frost but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects either way it was an awful lot of work to go through just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project as a seasonal holiday picture jack frost is pretty much a clunker a better christmas film from this year is i ll be home for christmas better yet my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film such as it s a wonderful life a christmas story or prancer jack frost is an earnest but severely misguided film and children as well as adults deserve better i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent anyway 
plot two sister witches have to live with a curse placed upon their family which prevents them from ever enjoying a full life with a lover the hex invokes the eventual demise of their loved one when one of their past loves comes back to haunt them they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma critique i ve been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now but hold on to your brooms and incantations cause this puppy is far from being it for a film that has the word magic in its title this movie contains very few moments of magic or humor for that matter drama suspense or romance well actually there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled it never lets you in on whether it s a comedy a drama a horror show or a murder mystery or maybe it s a romance eh it doesn t really matter cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them or the film as a whole if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack this film might ve had a chance to be more than what it is now which is an unentertaining crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab bag of stupid voice overs overdone songs melodramatic romance undeveloped story and uneven acting i only wish that i could make that one hour and forty five minutes of my life re appear but alas it is lost in the spiritual world of interesting ideas gone wildly awry little known facts about this film and its stars this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman co screenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for s batman robin director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours 
 i seem to have glued myself to myself starring jason biggs seann william scott chris klein thomas ian nichols allyson hannigan shannon elizabeth natasha lyonne tara reid mena suvari eugene levy jennifer coolidge directed by j b rogers rated r american pie reunites the cast members from american pie in a different setting instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives jim jason biggs is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance oz chris klein is still the sweetest guy on the block having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studying abroad girlfriend stifler seann william scott is still a horny stoner kevin thomas ian nichols still has no personality and finch eddie kaye thomas still longs for stifler s mom have i missed anyone so obviously not much has changed this is not a problem provided that the movie boasts the rapid fire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original but american pie is the very definition of sequelitis it s coarser yes and it pushes the envelope even more but its heart isn t in it it s easy cash to capitalize off the first film s success but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original part of the reason why the film doesn t work i think is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was a coming of age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness here everything has been cheapened they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking they have no motivation except for sex sex beer and sex that s not to say that you can t make a decent comedy from that premise but it is one of american pie s undoings missing too is the sweetness that permeated american pie the this could be you quality of the main players here the characters are too aware of themselves as pop culture icons and they re even more one note stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim oz and kevin are forced to make awkward self discoveries at arbitrary moments none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see and then there s the soon to be notorious scene where jim superglues himself to himself which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the film s ailments one that also permeated say it isn t so director j b rodgers debut there s a fine line between comedy and abject humiliation and american pie is on the wrong side of it it s hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie if there s one redeeming factor to american pie it s the inimitable eugene levy as jim s dad who pops in on jim as he s about to score and utters lines like your mother and i have been known to get frisky not so much anymore but and then when the girl s parents walk in blurts out this must be your daughter i didn t get her name but hopefully my son did if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levy s performance this is an unworthy sequel to a gross fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy the box office of this onw should keep the genre going strong which is disappointing the genre needs a hiatus filmmakers are getting lazy

this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james dick turpin sid james and his gang which includes harriett harry barbara windsor and tom doc scholl peter butterworth terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies stand and deliver owing to the increased occurrence of turpin s robberies captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners kenneth williams and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp jack douglas visit turpin s area of influence to bring him to justice they are under the express orders of sir roger daley bernard bresslaw their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin sid james whom they confided in earlier they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies however once they catch harriett and put her in jail and sir roger daley takes complete charge it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin then again sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable kenneth connor to keep an eye on their prisoner there is no doubt that this is a sid james carry on movie he excels in double roles as in carry on don t lose your head and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang and hattie jacques small but effective role as the rector s housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom and bernard bresslaw s character appears only briefly in the film the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the birds of paradise and sporting a fake french accent when her girls and her are robbed by turpin she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit a carry on by the numbers this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie the jokes are bluer the script is poorer it is the last script written by talbot rothwell but the music is a marked improvement although nearly all the regulars appear they seem to be just going through the motions none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double entendres 
synopsis original jurassic park survivor alan grant neill is tricked by paul and amanda kirby macy and leoni into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur to rescue their stranded son grant s team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought review there is one reason why jurassic park iii is better than its immediate predecessor the lost world jurassic park the latter wasted minutes of my life the former only the first park was a marvellous film full of awe inspiring sights interesting characters and genuine thrills its two successors have been pale imitations amounting to hundred million dollar b grade horror movies at least this third entry realises it whereas the lost world tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot jurassic park iii simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie the computer animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting and even the first time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie nothing in this rehash even comes close add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman payne and taylor and phoned in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character and there is much less gore than in the lost world making this installment more suitable for children 
so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci fi films such as close encounters of the third kind a space odyssey apollo and contact well whatever it is you d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange considering the disastrous results we re left with here this is a film that takes a little bit of everything but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing it s like i said this movie sucks plot a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet critique extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie uneven would be another the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise the buzz around it had been so so and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes all leading you to believe that it s actually going to go somewhere but it isn t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry colored planet tries too hard to get us into the pain of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix in a sci fi movie well i don t know much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half only to figure out some big secret in the end a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement ultimately this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise joins the crew in their misadventures in space for the main crux of its journey and eventually settles down for one of the most anti climactic endings this side of contact mind you if you enjoyed that film s shrug of the shoulders ending you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well of course i don t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story ugh what a friggin mess films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again didn t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script didn t they read the bad dialogue the cheezy lines the obvious derivative nature of the work mind you with a director like depalma at the helm that ain t saying much of course you can t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o connell in this fine crew of thespians nuff said neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film s musical score during the last fifteen minutes presumably in order to wake the audience up okay we get it brian this scene is supposed to be powerful wow yawn my ears hurt so is anything salvageable in this movie sure gary sinise does another great job as does cheadle the film doesn t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening and yes the sand twister effect that you see in the commercial is well done other than that i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies oops did i say admire i meant am disgusted all in all this movie delivers very little in actual substance offers two bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci fi mumbo jumbo pretends to be deep when really it s just sappy and eventually just settles into an ending which other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck go see the ninth gate now there s a great movie and on a personal note i think it s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial minute uninterrupted film sequences and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting 
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast who would have guessed that the most savage mad dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by ben kingsley my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark henry fonda in once upon a time in the west or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild sympathetic or even ineffectual character roles the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast gary gal dove played by ray winstone has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one two punch the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa the second punch comes from gal s past back in london gang boss teddy bass ian mcshane tv s lovejoy is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ben kingsley to fetch gal don will accept any decision gal makes from yes to certainly however if gal says no don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy s ex porn star wife deedee amanda redman in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody s skin kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness there are some serious problems in louis mellis s and david scinto s script that should have been caught before filming when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success beyond an ability to use skin diving gear no special talents are required of him any local hood could have done what gal is needed for additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault flooding the vault no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool in spite of the provocative title the story is cliched and overly familiar i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade the story is usually of the reformed outlaw a robert taylor type who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability the old gang however wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git im it is not a great plot in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film it is an old plot dressed up to look new if the plot is old at least the style is creative this is director jonathan glazer s first film but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes we see one side of a person s faces but the other side fades into the darkness a sort of metaphor for the half world these characters in habit half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking the heavy accents and the cockney language sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre the london crime film the plot may be new to british crime films but it would be overly familiar as a western further respectability comes from ben kingsley s high powered performance i give it a on the to scale and a on the to scale 
 there s nothing new under the sun is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means let s find something to copy of course there are very few completely original ideas even earth shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience there is after all no need to re invent the wheel time after time recently it seems that hollywood doesn t feel the need to even re write the script my understanding of the word sequel is a continuation of the story the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma s adaptation of the steven king novel this is your dream come true rachel emily bergl a high school outcast is beginning to notice weird things happening around her doors slam shut by themselves glass globes blow up her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out the in crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event any of this sound familiar once the audience catches on that this is the same story as carrie there s little to do but wait for the inevitable ending the effects are a bit better this time around but the film doesn t work nearly as well there are a couple of minor plot differences rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest and uh there must be other story changes but none stand out one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell over years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie now a high school counselor she befriends rachel but her character s potential is squandered there s too much about sue that doesn t make sense after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel s mother is in still living in the same small town the woman with a well known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease this may be the one original idea in the film but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a disease is never explained sue s eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn t figure out what to do with her blink and you ll miss it some of the events are filmed in black and white but the rationale for this is unknown it doesn t add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random the rage retains some of the trappings of carrie without the meaning in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie s onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating here there s an abundance of red but for no apparent purpose the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film and the flaws in this one 
teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights wallets in hand the formula is very simple you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in minutes the typical teenage attention span the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it s money on almost any film set in an environment they can relate to and most importantly they don t care to judge films quality so any piece of trash will due that is just what never been kissed the latest film from director raja gosnell is trash josie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times she has her own personal assistant unlimited supplies and her own office but she is very much dismayed with her position in life there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field where she can play a more active role in the chicago media so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jumps at it with elation constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gus john c reilly the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter however since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes and josie is headed for the field obviously the field assignment involves a high school specifically she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them i don t think that i need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring so i won t the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was and she appears to be heading down that road again fortunately for this lame production other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting they include the predictable love stories between both a student jeremy jordan and a teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing typical for teenage films it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy but those still don t recover for the total lack of quality in this movie following this trend of high school movie rules comes the general acting it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch she is required to play her character on two levels having some very black and white transitions and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher but she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic it is these qualities that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film david arquette scream takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini plot which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed in a dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the hit risky business never been kissed is a mediocre film at best the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood that it is sickening to watch time and again and this film is no exception the acting is just as bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light unfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be a success because teenagers will pay to see any trash 
a documentary from the twin hughes brothers allen and albert dead presidents menace ii society about street pimps all of whom are african american an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho s and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be is what you get i learned that the word bitch is their favorite word as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about then some of what they rap about might seem amusing they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money it s also a power trip accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place this sleazy pic soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models the feather hatted fur coated diamond ring wearing gold chain wearing flashy cadillac cruising pimp of the late s blaxploitation movies like the mack and willie dynamite also used as reference was iceberg slim s best seller pimp the story of my life we meet pimps such as fillmore slim c note charm k red gorgeous dre bishop don magic juan and rosebudd they readily discuss their business arrangements including percentages lifestyles knockin stealing another pimp s ho and the thrill they get from women giving them money these dudes needed no prompting to talk as they just love to brag about about themselves priests need nuns yaps c note a san francisco pimp doctors need nurses so ho s need pimps as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make that the girls need them to show them the ropes how to make money to be their security blankets protectors and counselors the race issue was brought up right from the film s onset as a number of white interviewees regular citizens note that their impression of a pimp is that he s the lowest form of human while we are told in the black community the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur riding around in fancy cars flashing wads of money dressed in a flamboyant style where his snake gaiter shoes might cost him a grand and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery of master and slave relations the film was all about pimp style and their projected image as they run a hard sell riff about the virtues of their work there are different styles of pimping but the film mentions them only as being macks and players or real pimps and perpetrator pimps but no further clarity is attempted it is also failed to get the women s side to this story of abuse primarily taking the pimp at his word the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing hungry for their minutes of fame the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp s wardrobe while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd married his ho and turned square working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer 
the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images the tinkling christmas tree bell in it s a wonderful life bogie s speech at the airport in casablanca little elliott s flying bicycle silhouetted by the moon in e t and now starship troopers director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug starship troopers loosely based on the robert heinlein novel is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects in the hands of verhoeven the mammoth sci fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale to put it simply it s a bug bomb in robocop and total recall verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence special effects and social satire and starship troopers starts off in similar fashion with a tongue in cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise things go downhill fast though as we meet our heroes a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school inexplicably johnny rico carmen ibenez dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial it s a veritable alpha centuri as we watch the love smitten teens squabble in the name of love michael ironside plays their teacher who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities eventually the kids join the military with dreams of glory in their addled little minds one of their classmates carl jenkins doogie houser s neil patrick harris snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother s leg a long dull boot camp sequence follows enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the showgirls director s camera roams over their buff bodies finally a full hour into the film the war finally starts and we meet the enemy the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears yes incredible as it seems the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary but the close ups are a different matter the insects have an odd artificial look like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating the attack scenes are intensely violent as one would expect from verhoeven but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension while the action is frantic the military strategy wildly illogical even by hollywood standards grows tiresome quickly verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage but the faux jingoistic scenes of children doing their part for the war effort by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren t enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here his customary one part satire two parts ultra violence formula is way out of whack and most of the film just flounders in showgirls fashion some scenes are almost bad enough to be good an intergalactic kegger party with jake busey playing dixie on a green plexiglas fiddle has a certain bizarre appeal a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug but tells her hero that she doesn t mind dying it s okay she gasps i got to have you and then of course there s doogie s mind meld with a bug it s possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel heinlein s pre stranger in a strange land books were aimed at adolescent males and starship troopers has the antiseptic retro future look of late s early s sci fi the one cityscape shown is a jetsons like gleaming metropolis with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting the hairstyles are retro too straight from the frankie avalon annette funicello school of fashion ultimately verhoeven s motives are irrelevant he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie avoid starship troopers at all costs 
sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom by way of the everglades to defend a young educated black man blair underwood the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl and says that his confession was coerced from the region s tough black cop lawrence fishburne watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough but the plot s a joke there s no logic at work here tone is also an issue there is none director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say is it a statement on human rights is it a knock off of silence of the lambs glimcher never tells instead he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop over drawbridge after drawbridge hoping that the audience won t notice what s missing just awful the madness of king george min not rated still wondering who nigel hawthorne is then check out his oscar nominated work in the madness of king george still playing in both raleigh and chapel hill stage director nicholas hytner in a remarkable screen debut has adapted alan bennett s tragic comedy to fine effect sumptuous looking and only mildly stuffy the film charts the madness that plagued king george iii hawthorne almost years into his reign a man of no importance min rated r in suri krishnamma s a man of no importance albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that it s a shame when the film gets so serious around him his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde he reads to his riders and once a year with their help he tries to stage one of the author s plays this year it s salome for about an hour there s a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of working class stiffs conflict arises but it s small stuff an administrator from the bus company here an outraged catholic pork butcher michael gambon there but with finney at the wheel so to speak the film rolls smoothly over these plot points just like the gorgeous leland double decker bus in the story where things get serious is toward the end of the film when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride the twist makes sense and helps paint a complete picture of finney s character but the trip to get there betrays the light airy atmosphere of what had come before it s not a fatal misstep mind you and it doesn t send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity it s just a turn off dr strangelove min not rated mein fuhrer the most fun that i had last month was in durham at the carolina at a mid week screening of stanley kubrick s pitch black comedy dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb the film stars peter sellers in three roles george c scott sterling hayden and slim pickens their antics brought the house down which to my surprise was packed by an audience younger than the film 
sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades like twelve angry men serpico or the verdict but in the same time almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet s reputation a stranger among us rip off of peter weir s witness belongs to the latter category the heroine of this movie is emily eden melanie griffith tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york during one of such actions her partner nick jamey sheridan got hurt and as a result she becomes depressed in order to help her recover bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community she decides to go undercover that isn t easy because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal using peter weir s formula isn t the greatest flaw of this film even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent but the worst insult to viewer s audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith the author of this review never liked this actress very much but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles role of emily eden unfortunately isn t one of them first of all she can t pass for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn t much better screenplay by robert j avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch but on the other hand other actors are more convincing lee richardson as an old rabbi thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community also the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time 
ugh that about sums this movie up just ugh the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic and when reviewing the previous films each film had a certain degree of intelligence and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following in spite of bad special effects horrible dubbing and a man in a lizard suit they maintained a certain degree of how to put this dignity not quite the word i m looking for you understand right and in years godzilla has maintained that degree of whatever leave it to america to screw the whole thing up from the geniuses that brought us independece day arguably the worst sci fi movie of all time to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had while they do bring us eye popping special effects that will amaze you they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies a storyline summing up the movie is simple heck i can do it in one sentence giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it simple as that matthew broderick stumbles over his lines and it s hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog walking character on the television show mad about you the dialogue seems to be improvized almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all i can see the scene on the set right now all right we spent all of this money making big special effects and we ve gotta get this movie out by summer or it s going to bomb in our faces so you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head all right make up something m kay good roll film the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing and some of the cinemtography is well done the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind still an hour into it you will become antsy wondering how long they can drag it out and drag it out they do i have to laugh the slogan for the film is size does matter i think they cut this too short it should read size does matter acting does not 
isn t it the ultimate sign of a movie s cinematic ineptitude when you can t think of much to say about it other than it sucks one of the first official year releases supernova is such a movie i can t seem to get past one word adjectives with this one although boring stupid and absurd doesn t amount to much of a review a shame i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate but c est la vie here goes nothing i ll keep it short i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill hours removed his name from the movie requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee the film s fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press an event usually signifying a studio s lack of confidence in a particular movie hill s and mgm s actions were prudent when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer for some reason james spader is forced to take command the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and on arrival picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony one of the crew members angela bassett knows this passenger who is played by peter facinelli and has some bad feelings about it and we all know what that means this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it another one of the crew members experiences this first hand after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo he does some impressive handstand pushups evidently touching this enigmatic egg shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger how why the movie never bothers to explain soon enough though spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad being chased by the all of a sudden superhuman facinelli to be honest i don t even remember exactly why i just remember that i didn t care supernova s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing in fact everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set well the effects are good though there s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i m not sure whether that s so remarkable an accomplishment the performances are hardly worth talking about i m not even sure i can call what s here performances though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger james spader is not a bad actor but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i ve seen in a while mostly because he isn t given a character with a personality the action scenes are just as bland since they re pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren t particularly entertaining the first time around and since the action scenes are everything to this movie it s pretty much dead in the water and for the life of me i can t figure out why it s called supernova 
kate jennifer aniston is having some problems it appears the twenty eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired she learns that her problems are related as the owner of her advertising agency mr mercer kevin dunn explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company taking clients with her a solution presents itself in nick jay mohr a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with kate s boss darcy illeana douglas uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick kate is at first repulsed by the idea but after getting immediate positive results she pursues it her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc at a dinner with kate s bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up she meets nick to propose the plan he accepts kate s new status brings unexpected results in other areas the office bad boy sam kevin bacon who wouldn t give kate the time of day now does now that she is engaged he pursues an affair with her as doing so would destroy her good girl image hence sam s sudden interest things start to fall apart for kate as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her and does not wish to break up with her after some provoking nick does oblige but problems continue for kate it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available or maybe kate does like nick but reconciliation will force her to admit her lies to her employer adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother olympia dukakis who wants her to get married and settle down there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is from the waist up only wearing a bra it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer it s like the director said well we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren t that great so what the heck let s show jennifer s assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating quite frankly it s insulting i don t think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie she did a decent enough job in ed burns she s the one because it was a smaller and supporting role and she just doesn t deliver the goods effectively in this movie her performance was not convincing unfortunately as far as romantic comedies go this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies the film is similar to my best friends wedding in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions gets no sympathy from me when things go awry i didn t care for how quickly kate puts down nick s profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn t glamorous enough for her co workers at least my best friends wedding changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending no such luck with picture perfect every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away including a couple that really made no sense after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first let alone consider a relationship was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick throw in the fact that i don t think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision i believe that kate liked him but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away i doubt it and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers well i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars then that would make sense picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate jennifer aniston nick jay mohr sam kevin bacon mercer kevin dunn darcy illeana douglas rita olympia dukakis written by randy turgeon february visit my movie reviews www xtdl com canran 
jet li busted onto the american action movie scene when he stole the show in s lethal weapon with his wicked looks his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma it only took another two years for mega producer joel silver to set him up in an all american movie primed to take over some of the empty action hero seats left by alleged coke head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts namely chow yun fat and jackie chan let s find out plot rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another when members of their respective families start turning up dead that s when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother s death and to exact some of his own style of revenge critique three words not enough action simple enough not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay bad actors crappy dialogue and oh so many over the top melodramatic moments and a romance angle why one must ask why i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences and jet well the poor dude was barely in the movie and i thought this was supposed to be his big break how bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung fu fighting chops slap him in a few more scenes and give him more chances to practice his acting english abilities what a letdown even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up empty shell of a film in fact i am sure that more time was spent gathering the hits for the soundtrack of this film than were on the so called screenplay i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn t matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines but no save lindo and aaliyah who weren t too shabby i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some year old looking guy acting like he s the overlord of a drug ring what a mess then again i don t want it to seem like i m complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway not the story well i guess that s what disappointed me the most out of this film there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving also as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt it should be seamless fellas not necessarily against the laws of gravity the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow but that simple creative touch couldn t save the rest of this film s uninteresting plot movements i m disappointed for jet li that this film didn t give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes hopefully the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor for now i just hope that for his sake the film s title isn t a premonition of the movie s ultimate fate at the box office 
 years ago national lampoon introduced us to a new family the griswolds in the griswolds embarked on a cross country journey with the destination of wally world a world renowned theme park in california we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured two years later we watched again as they went to europe and four years after that we shared christmas with them now eight more years have passed and the laughs have done more than die they ve been cremated vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold the good intentioned but ill fated father of two the premise is basically the same clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation this time to las vegas his wife ellen beverly d angelo and teenage kids rusty and audrey always played by different actors this time around by ethan embry and marisol nichols respectively join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick of course a vacation movie wouldn t be complete without good ole eddie reprised by randy quaid the misfit cousin showing up at all the wrong times there isn t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it it s really just a skit movie there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie which is not a real term as far as i know the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours therefore coming off like a two hour skit the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits each lasting about five minutes vegas vacation comes off like the first a good example of the latter would be last year s black sheep the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast and it doesn t really fit into a movie mold in these cases a plot which is generally very thin is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags i e have a good vegas joke make a vegas movie such is the case with this movie s mini plots clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold s money ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie shae d lyn as an exotic dancer the simple fact is this movie isn t funny at first i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes but when the movie got rolling my interest suddenly stopped chase plays clark griswold really well he made the character and he is the character d angelo to be quite honest never was too impressive as ellen and this movie doesn t show any signs of redemption as for the two new griswold kids the word blah comes to mind the vacation series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters the simple reason being that there is nothing to them they re so generic you ll expect the credits to read girl as audrey griswold vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor yes it s true that vegas vacation isn t even close to being close to being as funny as the others which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart first off why did they leave off the national lampoon s heading on the title i couldn t find any reasons why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn t want to be associated with such a lame film that s saying a lot especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon pcu etc if they expected this to be another hit you would assume they d be proud to tack on the notorious header but for reasons only we can guess at like the movie sucking they didn t there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact the first three films in the vacation series were written by john hughes a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the s including mr mom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris bueller s day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck wowzers what a r sum looking at the names you d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the s well that s not all this guy also brought us s hits including the home alone series the remake of dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber vegas vacation however didn t have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious this time around the script is in the hands of elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four made for tv movies vegas vacation plays very much like one and it would actually work much better as a made for tv sequel if this sounds like a wild idea it s not revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like it vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a a m sunday morning movie but as a silver screen major motion picture it s quite out of place stephen kessler s jejune direction doesn t help things either he only makes the film even more tv movie ish each consecutive vacation movie has suffered a drop in directing power we started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co writing ghostbusters not too bad then we had national lampoon s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling who would go on to direct the hits look who s talking and clueless as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high lastly we had national lampoon s christmas vacation directed by jeremiah s chechik who went on to direct the charming benny joon kessler so far has one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received an oscar nomination in granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get a movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal if you loved the vacation movies and i know some of us did there still isn t anything here worth seeing if you loved them don t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte if you never did like the series why the need to confirm why 
it s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying osmosis jones is crude gross disgusting and was directed by the farrelly brothers the twisted siblings behind there s something about mary me myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt not that there s anything wrong with scatology i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor such as it was it s merely that with osmosis jones the farrellys humor is too juvenile too predictable you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho the trouble is the animation may please the very young but the jokes may be over their heads while the teen age audience may find it too tame for their tastes adults well let s just say most will find it unappetizing osmosis jones plays like a minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby the live action sequences revolve around frank bill murray who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower frank much to the consternation of his daughter is a fast food addict eating anything and everything that can kill you he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner and presumably smell better than he does frank s body is invaded by thrax a lethal virus after frank eats a hard boiled egg that had fallen to the ground it s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth nope the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg wresting it from the primate s mouth like i said the gross meter tips the scales on this one after ingesting the egg the movie begins its animated sequences here osmosis jones voiced by chris rock a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix voiced by frasier s david hyde pierce a hour painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne basically what we have is a cliched cop buddy movie rife with all the clich s of that genre and this is why osmosis jones doesn t click it merely falls back on tired familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations the jokes and puns are lame osmosis searches out a snitch a former flu virus after pumping him for information drix tells osmosis funny he doesn t look fluish and the jokes don t rise above that level the live action scenes are no better frank is such a slob so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child he s almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left the animation is rather two dimensional and flat it lacks scope and depth it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater 
a sensuous romantic comedy about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out its the kind of stuff i ve seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen lope cruz who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot but who can t get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story pen lope was wonderful in pedro almod var s all about my mother but here she is so visible in such a stale story where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking that she somehow looks ridiculous as if she got egg all over her face the best you can say about her is that she s not to blame for this picture being so off this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex is in my opinion worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will the story is all about the love motion sickness and cooking ability of isabella cruz who is born in bahia brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents cook to cure her motion sickness her parents tried every remedy until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure she is able to control it now as long as she doesn t drive a car ride elevators follow in dancing and is the woman on top when making love in other words she has to be in control of things in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter toninho oliveira murilo ben cio and marries him they open up a successful restaurant where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it even though he s a loafer one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco we don t see her in flight so i can t tell how she handled her motion sickness problem unless she flew the plane she visits her friend s apartment monica harold perrineau jr who is a cross dresser blending right into the san francisco scene to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell freeing her from ever loving him again her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff mark feurerstein gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show you can really write the script from here on by yourself as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had but things continue to go bad for him there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village there is no chef to replace his wife as the restaurant is about to close for good so he comes to san francisco figuring he can charm her again he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians the ones he used when courting her when he serenaded her under her window he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick the yuppie tv producer chasing after her and sees that she is no longer charmed by him when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her the ratings go up and he s hired as a regular on the show the show gets so big that the network honchos come onboard taking it national but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show get rid of monica because he s a freak have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses and they change her ethnic dresses to low cut vanna white type of sexy dresses cliff her would be boyfriend acts creepy and sides with the network big shots even though he loved everything she did these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos they were revolting it was an insult to one s intelligence i m sure that i m not spoiling the ending for anyone when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again if the film wasn t terrible enough monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers it was so awkwardly done that it had no sense of truth or humor to it this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film because it doesn t look or feel like an almod var film the type of film it aspired to be but more like a film that was interferred with from above its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic as it searches for box office heaven 
and now the high flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics and it isn t pretty this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer a version of dumas s the three musketeers by bringing in popular asian actor stunt coordinator xing xing xiong whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting the end result is a tepid and dull action adventure rip off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay d artagnan justin chambers is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents in paris he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu stephen rea who is trying to overthrow the king and richelieu s man in black associate febre tim roth the killer of his folks he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk so he rounds up aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steven spiers to free the musketeer s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king s prison d artagnan and his new frisky love interest chambermaid francesca mena suvari play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen catherine deneuve ends up being captured by the menancing febre forcing the musketeers to regroup with d artagnan leading the charge and save the day director peter hyams end of days obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles but here it s a disaster one problem is that in reality most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones jet li s high risk is a rip off of die hard not the other way around ironically there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with to minute action sequences because they know the scenes have to carry the picture the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano sudden death horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers the wedding planner to deliver his mousy self as a leader chambers d artangnan isn t a musketeer he s a mouseketeer and hyam s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of th century paris are well noted but that s the only standout in an overall flat production 
for better or worse the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated oversexed underwritten thrillers apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn t change a thing since body of evidence wasn t written by him but has a puzzling eszterhas ish presence all over it in other words it s a really dirty and b really really stupid madonna first warning sign stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi naked presumably for the edification of the shrimp she s been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she s under thirty or at least looks it and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men what s worse is that the movie confirms all the above and wallows in them as well madonna s character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition and yes there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy this movie leave no scummy stone unturned anyway willem dafoe very good but completely wasted also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna s sexuality how do we know this because his character is set up with the token wife and kids how obvious is it that he s gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up and get kicked out of the house and get welcomed back anyway don t skip to the end yet we re just getting warmed up dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie most of it is about as erotic as open heart surgery since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don t know the first thing about really kinky sex and smashed light bulbs don t ask another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story it s insanely dull what s worse is that body of evidence is dull everywhere not just in the sex scenes the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes the thriller business itself is ridiculous it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor and the ending another homage to eszterhas maybe is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact frame where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in the director is uli edel all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f everyone has to eat i guess but this isn t a meal ticket it s leftovers 
susan granger s review of the musketeer universal pictures hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this million adaptation of alexandre dumas s novel that s strong on action but weak on drama fusing hong kong martial arts with th century swordplay the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d artagnan justin chambers as he leaves his village of gascogne headed for paris to join king louis xiii s elite guard the royal musketeers and to search for the man who killed his parents years earlier this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre tim roth vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu stephen rea the traditional musketeer trio aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steve speirs don t offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca mena suvari chambermaid to the queen of france catherine deneuve scripter gene quintano and director cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring do as evidenced by choreographer xin xin xiong s elaborate but not original stunts including a fast paced stagecoach chase a tavern brawl on rolling barrels high wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes and a ladder fight sequence filmed in southern france the scenery sets and costumes are spectacular but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy restless mtv ish cuts as the swashbuckling d artagnan bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing totally lacking on screen charisma not to mention acting skill mena suvari so impressive in american beauty seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court on the granger movie gauge of to the musketeer is a cinematic but shallow all for one and one for all not this time round 
 the following review contains some harsh language but what did you expect when you clicked on this title cast kristen holly smith danica sheridan alex boling michael dotson sonya hensley janet krajeski sabrina lu dionysius burbano calvin grant jeff b harmon written and directed by jeff b harmon running time minutes the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside blatz balinski danica sheridan laments the fact that her lesbian lover april kristen holly smith has just received a telegram from her ex fiance isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot smith a resident of the small town of bumfuck arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson michael dotson when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home sticks a gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger instead of killing herself she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed except for lance the homosexual toilet cleaner slave april loves her new home and friends but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up mr and ms pfferpot director jeff b harmon and janet krajeski decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr sigmoid colon also jeff b harmon who claims he can cure homosexuality in actuality dr colon is homosexual as well and begins his special treatment on dick dickson unbeknownst to dick when april turns down dick s demand for her to return to bumfuck he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo style instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance alex boling and the two of them along with april and her lover blatz get married note to the filmmaker why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i m assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided april s parents feeling like there is no recourse call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer their way the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the circuitry and they re wire it and send it back to washington d c destroying it mr and ms pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own i m not sure if writer director co star jeff b harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs either way he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie the film opens with a preacher running a small african american child out of town and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan during a jaunty musical number preceded by remarks about gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others such as the jews if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can t help but feel like he had some serious intent as for the entire central theme of the movie i m afraid that it s one that i just don t get i tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non acceptance i m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but don t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me again maybe i m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully as far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy despite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day speaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells ain t ringing could have been a decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying i m a lesbian which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms smith it s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based the other performers are decent save for the rosie o donnell like performance given by danica sheridan i have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired one particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented anti nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film once the isle of lesbos reprise was reached i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indie underground com the transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately in many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like a rocky horror for the new millennium this film is by no means my cup of tea but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it if you think it might be for you then by all means seek it out i on the other hand will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator wait aren t gladiator films considered to be oh never mind 
you know the plot a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime only to be double crossed by a fatal femme in palmetto the dimwit is harry barber woody harrelson a reporter who s just been released from prison he was framed by the gangsters and corrupt officials he was investigating enter la femme rhea malroux elisabeth shue the sexy young wife of the richest man in palmetto florida rolf hoppe she and her stepdaughter odette chlo sevigny have a plot to extort k from the old man harry will kidnap odette after groping both women harry agrees as everyone except harry can see he s being set up as a fall guy sure enough before long harry has a dead body in his trunk and the cops on his tail his brother in law tom wright an assistant da has hired harry to be the press liaison for the case so harry gets a front row seat for his own manhunt and we get to watch him sweat literally there are several plot twists of course a couple of them even took me by surprise apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog and they re on harry like he s the only bone in the kennel shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex avery s wolf to show up her incredible performance in leaving las vegas seems to have been a fluke here she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith shue s character is supposed to be a savvy schemer but she comes off as a brainless bimbo in addition to shue and sevigny the kennel includes gina gershon who filled the dimwit with a shady past role in bound as harry s girlfriend nina when harry gets out of jail she licks his face now there s a horndog the parts are so overplayed that with a little push palmetto could have been an over the top parody of film noir a la romeo is bleeding as it is it s best watched at am on showtime the love scenes seem to have been written for one of that channel s soft porn programs anyway palmetto has a well known director volker schl ndorff who s best known for his adaptations of major literary works especially the tin drum i suppose he must have been drawn to this plot by numbers script by the same admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake cape fear schl ndorff tries hard he makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugs but nothing can freshen up this stale script 
working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front line african american actress like jada pinkett smith despite being one of the freshest talents available pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts a low down dirty shame the nutty professor the problem is of course that there aren t many good roles available for black women take away the likes of waiting to exhale set it off soul food and eve s bayou and all that s left is a chance to be someone s girlfriend a local whore or a murder victim as a result for pinkett smith s first opportunity atop the marquee she is stuck in a stupid formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo actually woo the latest directorial effort from daisy v s mayer party girl could have been worse than it is the film offers a few funny albeit juvenile moments and the on screen relationship between pinkett smith s woo and tommy davidson s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags unfortunately huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple digit i q the situations are painfully contrived the main characters are lifted right out of sit coms and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of free lobotomy lab experiment woo is a spontaneous energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places her latest relationship with a testosterone overdosed drug dealer came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper now her transvestite medium friend celestrial girlina predicts that she s about to meet mr right and that he ll be a virgo later that day woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order who just happens to be a virgo it s not love at first sight however things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a quiet dinner in the one hundred year history of motion pictures there have been a ton of bad white movies about mismatched lovers so i suppose it s only fair that we get a black effort of the same low caliber as in all romantic comedies we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together the question is are their courtship rituals entertaining in a good entry to the genre the audience becomes caught up in the love story no matter how familiar it is in woo the constant reliance upon unfunny moronic humor sinks the project for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes there s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top sadly that s one of the film s most enjoyable sequences and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional despite exuding charm from every pore there s little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c johnson s script since it misses the mark by so much a better name for woo might have been whoops 
susan granger s review of the watcher universal just what we need another lurid trashy serial killer saga this time keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking clock cat and mouse game with james spader a burnt out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd to taunt spader who has relocated to chicago reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too before long he starts mailing photographs of the lonely unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims challenging spader along with the chicago police department to stop him within hours before he strikes again in the midst of this murderous frenzy there s spader s psychologist played by marisa tomei who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in the cell writers david elliot clay ayers and darcy meyers along with first time director joe charbanic helmer of music videos for reeves band dogstar dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase revealing early on exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop need each other to give meaning to our lives plus as reeves explains we re all stacked right on top of each other but we don t notice each other any more after that it s all sound effects and tricky camera work along with a muddled discordant soundtrack james spader s acting technique can be described as wooden deadpan while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone dude persona which sometimes works sometimes doesn t chris ellis as spader s self important colleague is the only cast member who manages to be convincing on the granger movie gauge of to the watcher is an appallingly awful amateurish the real torture is watching it 
according to the publicity material with this movie the directors hope to restore good old fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness hmm you never know they just might be on to something what with the rise of geek chic lounge music and seventies fashion the ever contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own but then i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it it s cheesy all right but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch that s a shame because in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise roy munson the movie opens in the fifties with roy s dad dishing out the reader s digest gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls shifting to the s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken it s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good he gives the wry derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy s hand then it s fast forward years later when munson is a fat balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand he s hopeless until he meets ishmael randy quaid an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno picking up pretty hustler claudia vanessa angel on the way with the exit of bill murray the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go and that s dumb and dumber yes indeed kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour peter and bobby farrelly the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle so prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands distended nipples ridiculous hair and bull semen get set for stock fish out of water situations when city boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking striptease and unchristian neighbour socking now don t get me wrong there s nothing wrong with cheap humour and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy the trouble is that these jokes aren t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction it lurches from sports movie to amish mocking to road trip to sentimental melodrama pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack never quite getting it all together some gags fall flat from a lack of build up while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don t do anything why the long unfunny fight in the car park why two of these why does that guy wear mascara or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it the film is full of these half thought through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying wouldn t that be funny well no actually the actors don t do the movie much favours either woody harrelson comes off okay plausibly acting dumb smart cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham and vanessa angel has no talent like schwarzenegger she seems more convincing playing a computer creation than a human take the tv series weird science please even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie s climax all in all a fairly useless attempt at comedy and a certified no hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance we ll have to look to a reinspired john waters or perhaps somebody from down under strictly bowling anyone for the definitive bowling comedy the flying inkpot s rating system wait for the video a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
alexander dumas the three musketeers is one of the most often adapted literary works and for good reason the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story perhaps the musketeer a new film that reimagines the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix is one adaptation too many it s just awful spiritless silly and unforgivably boring transforming the timeless classic into a mish mash of old as time clich s and incoherent repetitive action sequences this time d artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers who can t even pronounce his character s name as a boy he watched his father get killed by febre tim roth a lackey of power hungry cardinal richelieu he vowed to have vengeance after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman he goes looking for his enemy on his quest he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government the royal musketeers have lost their gusto what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal s own guards only a few loyal swashbuckers remain among them athos and portos who are only figureheads in this movie together with d artagnan they fight to extricate the queen catherine deneuve from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant oh and as an afterthought d artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn mena suvari just thought i d mention that now look i don t know whose idea this was but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue lashing i have nothing against modernizing classic works of literature at the very least they can inspire viewers to actually read the book but films as dull as this have no positive side effects director peter hyams known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas masterwork the sense of excitement cause and camaraderie instead we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing when the musketeers finally get to holler all for one and one for all i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams s tone which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader s digest condensed version of the story that he gives us it s as though anything that may have been construed as fun was purposely expunged from the production the joylessness of the proceedings from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes can be felt in every frame chambers can t act suvari roth and deneuve can but aren t given the chance and when push comes to shove the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit some movies seem sloppy and careless clearly made for a quick buck with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful the film is intricate stylish and precise hitting the wrong note every single time 
movies can do the two big es very well educate and entertain in the best of all possible worlds they accomplish both on the red planet they fail entirely in the near future a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be after some mumbo jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does the ground crew of people you couldn t care less about is trapped on the surface without food water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog the one potentially interesting character carrie anne moss spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer attempting to graft esque space mysticism with terminator robot horror first time director antony hoffman can t seem to figure out what s going on neither can we didn t he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story couldn t he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter there are so many mis steps every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction why introduce the theme of faith vs science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die offscreen the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen two hours later they re still waiting despite our greatest hopes there is no life on the red planet 
as the twin surfer dudes stew and phil deedle lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother yanking out his iv he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother s face this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney s meet the deedles a movie more to be endured that watched i stopped looking at my wife during the screening since every time i did she d start sticking her finger in her throat and she s right it is that bad directed without any imagination by steve boyum whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction the film limps along at best boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts stunts and more stunts amazingly for someone with his background he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones and we have a car go off the road five different times maybe more but who s counting and then there is the script by james herzfeld whose only other film tapeheads from a decade ago was so awful that it is considered a cult classic meet the deedles however is painfully bad rather than laughably bad it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes your geyser s a geezer and i d like to put a deedle in her haystack as the movie opens the twins who at one point describe themselves modestly as a walking kodak moment are celebrating their th birthday as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid back beach bums into men as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone they ve got their surfboards skateboards and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire their camp has gone out of business but they are mistaken for new park rangers the rest of the movie has them fighting the park s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex ranger played by dennis hopper who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration scheduled for later in the week hopper who has made some wonderful movies carried away being a recent favorite does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material this isn t his worst acting but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he s ever been in steve van wormer and paul walker as stew and phil give lifeless performances the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull to add insult to injury hennings is fond of inappropriate close ups which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog put a ten foot pair of lips on the screen and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie s stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road they make it look like so much fun that i m sure many will try some variation of the stunt how could this possibly be worst asks phil just when you suspect it can t the movie takes a turn further downhill its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag after phil s girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil they suck in a long worm like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp their lips finally meet in a kiss as they pull back their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around and up my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas both almost gave the show they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo 
i won t even pretend that i have seen the other alien films i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard day s work i didn t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after minutes of painful viewing but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning sigourney weaver who s role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of ripley who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien years later scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being i m sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now we ll just ignore it and move on why you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated well the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research they yawn were wrong it doesn t take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un flossed teeth there s a little saying that goes something like this if you re going to make a bad film do it well i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me alien resurrection a good example of a film that really gets up my nose is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore which attempts to distract us from the wandering but not going anywhere plot in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable if you think i m struggling to find one good aspect about the film then you thought right one exciting scene is a credit and the only part remotely worth seeing to the film in which an alien chases two men one a cripple up a tall ladder with interesting results but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is oh and in case you re wondering about my bag of lollies the less i enjoy a film the more i eat so all the lollies were gone in minutes but however empty the bag turned out to be it was still a long way ahead of the movie 
movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting entertaining or convincing because of one fundamental reason movies are made by adults and not teenagers occasionally however films like say anything dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called teenagers can t hardly wait however does not instead the writing directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich found in the teenage genre strip it completely of perception intelligence and wit and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to can t hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them there s the average male protagonist preston ethan embry prom queen and cheerleader amanda jennifer love hewitt football star mike peter facinelli white rapper wannabe kenny seth green computer geek william charlie korsmo and brainy outsider denise lauren ambrose i couldn t stand any of those characters whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming yo i gotta have sex tonight all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film apparently can t hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it s not funny in all honesty elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour and when i say forced i mean it they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour for instance can t hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as i am a sex machine for some reason elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough eventually it will be funny if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk now that s funny 
the ads for batman and robin scream the event of the summer is here and that s the problem the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it batman and robin is minutes of lavish sets flashy costumes and big confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance it s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows bright busy and visually diverting but not very much fun it wasn t always this way tim burton s batman was an epic story of obsession and duality of darkness and revenge the film while far from perfect was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel batman was a creepy brooding creature of the night the joker brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson was at once charismatic and repellent batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin battling inner demons and one another over gotham city s breathtaking gothic skyline those days of the dark knight are gone replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck batman and robin has far more in common with the campy s batman tv show than with tim burton s tale of darkness the blame lies with director joel schumacher a former window dresser schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes unfortunately when it comes time to have those people walk and talk he hasn t the faintest notion of what to do batman and robin is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it s often difficult to tell who s whacking who while the characters flail at each other one liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film batman and robin doesn t merely lose momentum it stalls out completely on several occasions it s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one ironically the parts of batman and robin that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne easily the best batman yet clooney s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn t even hint at the film s most effective scene is a tender quiet exchange between clooney and alfred michael gough bruce wayne s butler and surrogate father as for the other heroes chris o donnell s robin is enthusiastic perky and horny as hell while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl in a movie filled to the brim with major characters the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne s girlfriend is puzzling i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built in nipples shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight of course the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that s where batman and robin really suffers as mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion laboring under a ton of appliances schwarzenegger looks as if he s having trouble even moving in his suit let alone trying to act uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character it s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain s he must be a cartoonish bumbling nerd once thurman transforms into the eco psychotic poison ivy she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss thurman fails to maintain the character s maniacal sense of style though and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film the biggest lesson to be learned from batman and robin is that more is not better joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam i don t think so my prescription fire joel schumacher but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist s convention so he ll understand that there s no hard feelings give alicia silverstone her walking papers while keeping clooney o donnell and michael gough call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman then ditch the campiness and for the love of pete lose the event mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time 
 the following review contains spoilers it s just the way we are a rapist matt frewer responds to supergirl s helen slater query as to why she s being attacked an example of the mind numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl i ll admit it i love superman iii i know it s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor but i still think it s a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise supergirl a spin off film of sorts from the series same producers alexander and ilya salkind doesn t even rival superman iii in terms of quality let alone superman or superman ii supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time as the film begins we see the residents of argo city a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in inner space go about their daily lives ok what so these are exiles from krypton which blew up right were they living there before krypton exploded how do you get to inner space this whole inner space notion is never explained particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world how do they know where superman went how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron one day the founder of argo city zaltar peter o toole gives the omegahedron to superman s cousin kara helen slater for use as inspiration in her art kara uses it to create a bug like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of whatever that protects the city in the chaos the omegahedron sails out through the opening dooming the argonians to death in three days time or something kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor league witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip was ruined announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans and she sets out to achieve world domination selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth and that she s arrived as supergirl complete with appropriate costume supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives ok huh why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake attention movie explain yourself i m sorry i can only suspend disbelief so much i can t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to knowing that she needs a secret identity supergirl basically wills herself into a school girl outfit complete with a different hairstyle picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school she s given her dorm assignment and who happens to be her roommate lois lane s sister lucy ok coincidence is one thing folks but we re getting really contrived now what follows are some generic all girls school hijinks complete with evil bully girls mean for no reason of course and even a shower scene best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks at this point i m rapidly wondering why i m bothering with this nonsense there is some credit to give to the film however one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an evil bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its prey is very well done also its commendable to see genders reversed in the film whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools hart bochner die hard is particularly fun as kara s love interest a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena although he is unfortunately part of one of the film s more ridiculous moments when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some menacing bumper cars then there were numerous little things that bothered me the flying effects are never convincing for a moment it s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires instead of having her look like she s flying the filmmakers wanted her to be graceful so she poses a lot and does ballet type maneuvers also who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth a pair of truck drivers rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a wacky demise there is also some rampant product placement in the film most notably for popeye s tylenol and a w root beer with the latter actually putting its logo on the t shirt of one of the rapists finally just one word monsters faye dunaway and peter o toole ham it up unmercifully however when o toole overacts he s entertaining and when dunaway does it she s annoying her character actually says the line seize them at one point dunaway s henchmen played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty s otis character from the first two superman movies helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent naive character she s written to be as she s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable believability aside though it s still annoying now despite all this negativity and i m not alone here supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested but excited about its release on dvd they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd to the delight of many people including myself yet i m still unclear as to why since this movie is so awful the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs minutes longer than the print which ran in u s theaters the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of is enhanced for x televisions and has been remastered in full thx glory extras on the disc include a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent minute documentary from called supergirl the making of a feature dig that workout montage trailers tv spots talent bios in depth storyboards accompanied by score from the movie and assorted still galleries the transfer on this international version is incredible you d think you were watching a new release images are sharp colors jump off the screen and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts only some special effects sequences show the wear of time and there just isn t much that can be done about that unless you re obsessive like george lucas the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films golan globus production the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there s no dead air on the track bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation although at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc and is surprised when he doesn t get that response we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track most notably the almost appearance in the film by christopher reeve great detail is given about superman s proposed role in the original script before reeve wisely dropped out as it stands superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission for the sake of brevity i won t even get into that one szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed to stand on its own replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office again for the sake of brevity i won t even get into that one anchor bay has also released a limited edition only copies pressed two disc set disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release disc two features the never before seen director s cut of the film which runs minutes long the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don t add much of note except for a few moments which lengthen peter o toole s screen time particularly during his latter appearances the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono but fans of the film won t care one question though shouldn t the director s commentary be on the director s cut of the film i d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd i was nine when it was released to theaters and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect i knew the film wasn t beloved and i never had any interest in it before but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started at the end of the film supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron and flies back to argo city ugh i give up i m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once not twice but three times to review these discs supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package but a very lousy movie pg 
some movies i should just skip my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back and here comes another disney effects filled live action flick based on an old tv program true the probgram is only years old this time and it s a cartoon but it s a cartoon i liked and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen but my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be turns out i was right mostly inspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian down to the jive talking side kick at first i thought it was done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isn t just business it s a way of life the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits in some parts you can just hear them saying more zany i want more zany here and here let s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful i want the audience squirming in their seats ok that s fine but i want you to add bug guts what does this scene do character depth but where s the zaniness i don t see zany here if you can t make it zany cut it the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie michelle who plays penny gadget s niece shines in every scene she s in but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor dabney coleman s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the gidget bitch from hell town mayor oteri s overly enthusiastic and continually self congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland oregon s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn t poking fun at our fair town or maybe all career politicians are like that i must say matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla he appears to have some fun with the film especially as the evil gadget rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film d l hughley plays the shuckin and jivin vehicular side kick in a role that firmly sets emancipation back years the dialog is let s face it it s pretty bad the tag line after a major set piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context a lot of the lines especially hughley s appear to be made up as they go along by people with little gift for ad lib about three quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations not really battles with the evil gadget penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon let me rage here just for a minute michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character she s utterly charming and has excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pint size detective why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity inspector gadget is missing the long long stretches of potty humor that among other things made my favorite martian so unbearable but it s a very short movie so perhaps something was cut at the last moment probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits the evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it s onscreen all in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it s generally money making cartoons to produce these losers but if true why if they re trying for another mary poppins they need to find a team that can produce one and then give them a chance to do it 
the ads make hanging up seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed all of the movie s funny scenes were included in the ad so what do we get eve marks meg ryan just put her father lou mozell walter matthau into a hospital once upon a time lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now estranged wife his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne who gave him a giant bullet shaped trophy now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly eve tries to convince her sisters georgia diane keaton and maddy lisa kudrow that their father is dying and needs them both are slow to show concern so devoted eve stands vigil over her father who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia while running her own business planning special events and caring for her son jesse james some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st bernard for eve to care for the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve s events where georgia is the keynote speaker there s a superficial resemblance to shakespeare s king lear senile king with three daughters one devoted saint and two selfish bitches but the material is apparently drawn from life sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on screenplays including desk set and there s no business like show business delia s novel the basis for the film is dedicated to henry surprisingly the script is as thin as an anorexic s wet dream the virtue of a semi autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available yet the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters also the spaces they inhabit seem artificial eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout no matter how put upon she is we can t feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day georgia is a famous magazine editor and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile when we first meet maddy she s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream i expected to see the credit cinematography by vanity fair and yes diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow s mother to her credit though she looks young enough to pull it off the one redeeming aspect of hanging up is that at its core is a truth about siblings there s always one on which everyone else in the family relies freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant my wife is the reliable child in her family for better or worse my brother has the role in mine being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling but it is a lot less work if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters mother pat in a devastating scene eve discovers that her mother doesn t love her although leachman is best known for comedies like young frankenstein and the mary tyler moore show her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in the last picture show bottom line everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they don t recognize real life anymore

when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in jackie brown he immediately signed up for a little film called american perfekt this was almost two years ago i waited patiently for the film to be released but it never was finally i forgot about it the other day though while i was perusing the selection of the local video store i stumbled upon you guessed it american perfekt i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee rushed home to view it having now seen the film i understand why it never saw theatrical release american perfekt is a jumbled mess the storyline is non existent it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on and at that point the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was never going to introduce a plot of some sort it wants to get by on quirkyness and so called charm alone and it just doesn t work robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer and they head off on the road together along the way to no discernable destination they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters i suppose this free wheeling no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment but all it did was make me sleepy i m all for trying new things within the realm of film but not at the expense of coherence nothing in this movie makes sense the actions of the characters go unexplained even when they re truly bizarre i ll give you an example without giving too much away david thewlis has a part as a drifting con man at one point mid way through the movie he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car as he passes them we see that his face is covered in blood do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him you would think so wouldn t you american perfekt is a waste of time nothing is gained from watching this movie except maybe a migraine and if you do rent it don t bother trying to figure out what s going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end this doesn t happen and no explanation is given for the misspelling of perfect either 
what hath kevin williamson wrought while the horror movie revival spurred on by his scream has yielded a few decent entries in the genre i know what you did last summer halloween h and scream it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films those williamson less post scream efforts among them wishmaster and the recent disturbing behavior have been frightening all right frighteningly insultingly bad add to that list urban legend which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas first the opening sequence like that of scream is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling this sequence in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini natasha gregson wagner is decapitated while driving also reveals the other obviously williamson esque touch the killer s look dressed in a large hooded parka wielding an axe the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the i know fisherman sans the hook one thing horta does not borrow from williamson however is the intriguing premise students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends those contemporary bits of mythology passed from person to person group to group year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness it hardly matters if they are true or not such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi he didn t michelle slain by the killer lurking in the backseat of lore is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true as the body count rises fellow pendleton student natalie alicia witt suspects not only a link between the murders but a personal link to her past as well the setup shows promise but the story never takes off due in large part to horta and the director the aptly named jamie blanks who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares too many of the would be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues and the film s chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that scream tried to subvert like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should and could run out the front door but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches there s also the climactic villain confession in which a contrived and way too convenient motive is revealed not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick which is a cliche in any film genre banks and horta s intentional attempts at humor are also lame the fact that the best gags are lazy in jokey references to the other credits of co stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed but i m not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so the filmmakers don t get much help from their onscreen talent i was far from a fan of bland i know starlet jennifer love hewitt but i d talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence challenged leading man jared leto dawson s creek star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo gayheart displays all the depth and range of well a noxzema spokeswoman and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor granted the cast is hampered by their material loretta devine who has done some fine work in films such as waiting to exhale is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier worshiping campus security guard the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man namely kevin williamson to stay alive if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as urban legend the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers many victims 
 bicentennial man is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment chris columbus the director who gave you mrs doubtfire plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point based on the short story by isaac asimov it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human which as you can imagine is very difficult starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children soon this robot called andrew robin williams shows abilities that makes his owner mr martin sam neill very curious andrew is interested in art and music he enjoys making clocks which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions it shows out that because of a small failure in the electrical circuits and positronic brain andrew has accidentally gained a soul this makes him unique and his evil creators worried then mr martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn t programmed to do soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom destiny and love this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction ever since that film the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy what makes us human the thoughts the emotions is it possible to become human at what point can we say to a robot now you are one of us these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach it is obvious that columbus didn t take them very seriously when you think about it this film is not really meditating on the question when is a robot no longer a machine but a human being but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being and only the society has troubles with it in other words it is as far from reality as from the academy awards further more there are other annoying problems to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than years from now this has not been done for obvious reasons because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task columbus is the first to have crossed that line the result is as you might imagine primitive unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort the world is simply frozen in time neither the society fashion culture or values have changed over years mom is still working at the kitchen doing the dishes when you think back to the late th century and then compare it to the world we live in today you ll see a slightly bigger difference i am not saying that everything should change it is unlikely that the human rights will change but it s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science technology and fashion i suppose it s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale but it s really hard robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way as always he does a decent job as does sam neill but it doesn t really matter it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience pretty much like last year s meet joe black this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn t deserve great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten when isaac asimov wrote this story the future seemed far away and magical everything seemed possible now is the future of asimov s time and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne s leagues under the sea so can t we accept this story as a potential reality let us hope that next year s a i will be more rewarding 
for a good ten years or so super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene now he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo who launched chow s super stardom in the acclaimed a better tomorrow by moving to hollywood i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt his final job requires him to kill a policeman s seven year old boy this he refuses do and runs however he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job cue around minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot outs which take place in various locations some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring the car wash scene i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked tut tut the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie and not on the content mia sorvino a passport forger is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow s excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots chow s trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale which in fairness is quite good and there s not even a toothpick in site and as for making chow shoot like a cop well that s damned unforgiveable to round up the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow it would appear he has left asia for a minute pop video this is not what we wanted at all considering john woo was the exec producer did he have no say so at all watch the killer again and weep at the difference review by chris hill there s room at the top they are telling you still but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill 
way of the gun is brimming with surprises some good most bad one of the good ones is ryan phillippe s surprisingly halfway decent performance after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer he hinted at a bit growth in last year s cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans and start bellyaching about how he d fallen for his target it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film s director could negotiate but he seems to be trying and that shouldn t be overlooked or probably over praised seeing as how at this point he really isn t required to do much but look pretty here phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his look here see glory it s tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass but his performance actually helps with the illusion unlike ben affleck s puppy dog approach in reindeer games phillippe is believable and not too bad at that as for the plot well that s one of the bad surprises phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic and not even remotely likeable criminals introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother juliette lewis after overhearing that she s carrying the baby of painter scott wilson a very well connected wealthy man the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed but the anti heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man james caan and two scheming bodyguards taye diggs and nicky katt remain in pursuit directed by christopher mcquarrie the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles this one included way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity unlike phillipe mcquarrie doesn t seem to be growing at all he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i ve seen before and worse it feels like it the film lacks even a fresh approach like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey to its clich s all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah rather than any thing resembling life even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life philosophy etc i didn t like the bit much when it first appeared in heat here it s even more self consciously dramatic usual suspects which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential thus nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret most amateurishly projected before they appear and it too has an ironic little twist at the end nothing earth shattering like in the usual suspects but i admit i didn t see it coming and i smiled however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason or substance it s just as overplotted as suspects and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters a distinctive style or a good script would be even the good stuff most of which involves james caan doing a fine job feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like karma is only justice with out the satisfaction are clever at one point caan laments need is the ultimate monkey a line so inexplicable he might as well have said love is like hippo ass i ve seen porno with better dialogue and some with better plot lines too but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast i mean can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy caan slips into this role with seeming ease he could do this kind of soft spoken tough guy in a coma but he manages to give his character depth and weariness benicio del torro is always welcome though here he plays it fairly straight rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage adopting a brad pitt esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering speaking of pitt his ex juliette lewis is a weak link either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness or waddling about like a silly goose nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted he s only kept around for his cold presence taye diggs has a similar function cool as ever but never a character though the guy has one helluva death scene for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo s ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns it s vaguely tarantino ish but in a bad truth and consequences nm way with phillippe in one scene leaping into a stupid rant about faggots migrating to los angeles you know the routine the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at but those gun shots sure crack like thunder just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt like sound that emanated from harry s fetishized smith and wesson oh how far we ve come 
the year is barely a week old and there is already a candidate for the worst of the relic a would be chiller that s more successful at making the audience laugh than scream in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams whose last two pictures were dreadful jean claude van damme vehicles a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses hypothalamii of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum how did this creature come into existence and why does it feed on hormones the scientific explanation cooked up by the four yes four credited screenwriters amy holden jones john raffo rick jaffa and amanda silver takes suspension of disbelief to new heights even by monster movie standards but as cockamamie as the science is in the film it isn t quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears give it up penelope it s a monster movie on the flip side tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant but his role is so thankless that it s hard to imagine it being played any more effectively it s quite funny to see a film indulge with the straightest of faces in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well and so recently in scream for example in one early scene a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night ok we all know what s coming but as if we didn t need any more confirmation he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie and later miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing does she make a beeline for the front door of course not she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall with all the cliches it is only fitting the film s climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film that of someone outrunning a fireball if the relic is truly the next evolution in terror as the poster states then the horror film and humanity is in even worse shape than we thought 
i m a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson s work he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain with teaching mrs tingle his directorial debut williamson has reached the end of his rope what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here the components are all there including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to but where are the thrills the laughs both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge and what a shame that is i loved the scream films heck i even enjoyed the sci fi goofiness of the faculty kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office teaching mrs tingle a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers may put an end to his reign or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties i still have my faith but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past the title character of his pet project is a vicious uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over the top by british actress helen mirren mrs tingle is basically every student s worst nightmare a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard working of her pupils the principal michael mckean is horrified of her and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way mirren s performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink in other words it s a poor substitute for williamson s best work the plot is a big problem here material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann an over achiever hoping to get a college scholarship but typical mrs tingle says her history project which she worked on for countless hours is laughable later on while studying in the gymnasium a classmate barry watson offers her a photo copied duplicate of mrs tingle s final exam leigh ann s best friend marisa coughlan encourages her to use it alas the old hag herself finds the three scheming and snatches the test and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning in the morning how convenient the three students head to mrs tingle s house attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann s name things get out of hand and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her of course not everything goes entirely to plan besides pointless sub plots involving the football coach jeffrey tambor horribly wasted there is little by way of actual progress there is no urgency to the situation little tension or laughs are involved the humor is completely inconsistent after many of the jokes the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze you continue to await some momentum in the story something that could possibly revive the slow pace a moment like that never arises williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players including the talented mckean and larry sanders vet tambor and the beautiful vivica a fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor and then williamson disposes of her character entirely on the plus side holmes and coughlan are admirable with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher while everything is pretty lifeless teaching mrs tingle remains watchable there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching she is convincingly evil and fun to watch but even her gifted delivery can t save individual scenes that flounder in boredom if there is one word for the movie surrounding her it would be disappointing basically kevin williamson is his worst enemy here his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated not that his writing here is especially good we will see when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas whether williamson is for real 
 desperate measures is a generic title for a film that s beyond generic it s also a depressing waste of talent with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles not to mention once cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not cool flicks this thriller is more before and after than reversal of fortune the movie is a big disappointment and yet it s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it the premise is both promising and intriguing too bad the execution s all wrong though because the set up of desperate measures boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use san francisco cop frank connor garcia is a single parent with a troubling dilemma his son matt joseph cross is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission even worse the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe michael keaton currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery he s at first reluctant but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital when he does make a run for it connor offers close pursuit but for different reasons than his superiors including the crusty brian cox they want to take mccabe down while connor needs to keep him alive or all hope is lost for his little boy one misstep desperate measures makes is in its underdevelopment of matt s illness what s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow take for example a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him and what does connor do he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son whatever to be fair though the lack of story background is the least of the movie s problems first and foremost is how cheaply desperate measures trades the potential of it s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour once mccabe escapes the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away also the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot inducing lip smacking villain the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter natch that it completely casts garcia s frank connor by the dullsville wayside desperate measures appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist and the movie s head scratcher of a send off confirms this there is some good to be found amongst this mess particularly in the acting department cast against type michael keaton s understated menace is highly effective although he s not given much believable to work with andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord joseph cross as garicia s ailing son is surprisingly unsentimental and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending but most is lost it goes without saying that desperate measures needs an operation of its very own 
an foot high foot long dragon is the computer generated co star of this strictly by the numbers sword n sorcery flick as voiced by sean connery draco is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well deserving of his minutes of screen time he walks talks flies fries and even fakes his own death all with the help of computer aided animators too bad that ilm industrial light and magic couldn t spare some special effects for dragonheart s human co stars a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be he s a near total loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight david thewlis evil king has a high hiss factor hf though he s more of a mumbling oddity than anything else oh and there s some redhead in a s wig who runs around either screaming or scowling depending upon if the particular scene has her playing the woman in peril or the put upon peasant the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a wandering monk with literary ambitions julie christie as the good queen mother a band of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde heavy metal concert and believe or it not the speaking spirit of king arthur bring out your dead unfortunately when we add it all together draco fringe bits quaid thewlis the sum total amounts to zero dragonheart is well too much of too little director rob cohen dragon the bruce lee story has made a big expensive movie that while ambitiously plotted is both murky and predictable and overscored and self important and the list goes on i must ask did screenwriter charles edward pogue intend that every character be stabbed lanced or sliced at least once keep that man away from the knife drawer the last five minutes of this movie are the worst with some silly celestial nonsense that would be laughed out of any planetarium light show much less a summer movie save your money 
i don t expect much from eddie murphy these days for the past four years the gods of cinema or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates have allowed him to make one bad movie after another such films as metro doctor dolittle holy man life and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed up hack performing as a studio puppet for th century fox and universal pictures the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film nutty professor ii the klumps the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places sherman has just invented a new youth drink that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor and for the most ridiculous reasons with love on his mind sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego buddy love from the first professor who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers with some convoluted mumbo jumbo about dna extraction sherman extracts the buddy love link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy dandy lab beaker but one night the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy then the klump family all played by eddie murphy step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex flabby breasts a slew of fart and dick jokes and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene pure and simple the klumps is a failure its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process it s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade american pie have their names stamped to this trash hey guys quick note keep this movie off of your resumes the characterization of sherman s family the klumps is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts the father is gruff is fired from a blue collar job is sexually inadequate and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn t act like this all the time the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last or so unbearable and pathetic after a while their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line even the best effects can t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days now that i think about it the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make people will be lined up around the block for it the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles but he ll play every character in the movie i just can t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself 
 lake placid marks yet another entry in the series of predator pics that were a screen staple in the late s post jaws and were revived recently by the godawful anaconda placid claims to be a horror comedy it s directed by the same guy who did house but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of anaconda paleontologist kelly scott bridget fonda is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile which shouldn t even be in this hemisphere kelly goes croc hunting with game warden jack wells bill pullman and sheriff hank keough brendan gleeson they re joined by an unwelcome guest hector cyr oliver platt a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them along the way the merry band meets mrs delores bickerman betty white a weird old lady who lives out on the lake you know what to expect from this movie lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator croc cam swimming toward someone s dangling legs while jaws like music plays one character hector who s obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest another character who insists that the predator can t possibly exist unlike its slippery cousin anaconda lake placid wants to present its formulaic plot tongue in cheek which is self defeating the result is neither scary nor funny it s just tedious while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume including two installments of friday the th and halloween h screenwriter david kelley best known as the creator of tv series like ally mcbeal and chicago hope doesn t seem to have the stomach for a chomp em up flick the body count is surprisingly low and doesn t include any of the major characters and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it lake placid manages to have it both ways i ll let you discover how for yourself the croc itself is mostly computer generated of course like the snake in anaconda the thirty foot monster crocodile doesn t seem real it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural lake placid also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine there is a lot of semi mystical mumbo jumbo about how we really don t know much about crocodiles they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers a movie like this doesn t have to offer much of an explanation radioactive mutant creature from outer space but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto pilot most of the time they re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers platt and white on the other hand seem to be giving their best efforts and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script 
stephen please post if appropriate mafia crime isn t a funny business by homer yen c on a particular night when i found myself having some free time i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see mafia a spoof of mafia and crime films such as the godfather goodfellas and casino at minutes in length i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep but by my account i think that my laff o meter only registered a few grins one giggle and maybe one chortle i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star lloyd bridges who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film mafia chronicles vincenzo cortino s lloyd bridges life separated from his family when he was young he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life but as fate would have it vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord following in his footsteps are his two sons joey billy burke and anthony jay mohr like all siblings in powerful crime families they squabble over power the future of the family fortune and women mafia is co written by jim abrahams who also contributed to some gut busting funny spoofs such as airplane and the naked gun but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work as i write this i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence it s a tough genre to parody i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say please as they decide which sector to take over but this opportunity was never explored there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter in law a gunman shoots him several times the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him from the samba to disco to the macarena i think that i just gave away the best part of the film oh well that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier 
eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights as the movie s writer director executive producer and star murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails but at the same time he ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds should you sacrifice your hard earned cash to support murphy s risky gamble well that depends on whom you trust more me or eddie murphy here s what murphy thinks i think the audience is expecting a good time they gonna get sexy they gonna get funny they gonna get drama they gonna get all of that i think it s the best movie i ve done paramount radio network here s what i think harlem nights is charmless unoriginal disappointing and almost without question the worst film of the actor s career i haven t seen best defense and guess who s to blame the movie s problem is not murphy s direction harlem nights is a fairly good looking film no the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled murphy s awful script is the culprit let s count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture yes he even outdoes his own work in raw practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word and after minutes it gets irritating murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast richard pryor redd foxx michael lerner and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes each of them shines occasionally but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life which is really neither here nor there but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on movie screens across the country it s another matter altogether you re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff for instance murphy punches della reese in the stomach and he shoots jasmine guy in the head this is a mean spirited movie folks lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore but only because she doesn t have any scenes with murphy thank god he might have run her over with a bulldozer murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair the plot is a shameless rip off of the sting if you re going to make another sting movie you ve got to do something original murphy s tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem circa fails to add anything new to the formula to get laughs murphy makes fun of stuttering you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped murphy s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life for what for shooting reese s little toe off needless to say murphy shows little if any promise or imagination as a screenwriter in all fairness however a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take aiello stands out in the large ensemble cast he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character a racist detective with mob ties aiello s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice another bright spot is arsenio hall who has a hilarious show stopping cameo as a cry baby gangster hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy in fact hall s ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie unfortunately his character is completely irrelevant to the plot murphy should have given hall a much bigger role of course i ve already mentioned that i didn t care for murphy s character but i have to admit that i did love his neckties they are simply spectacular almost worth the price of admission 
you think that these people only exist in the movies but trust me they re as real as life i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person s brain with microwaves then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted these people had what are known as conspiracy theories ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public a little imagination goes a long way in richard donner s conspiracy theory jerry fletcher mel gibson is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything his latest that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle might sound outrageous to us but is all in a day s work for him he combs the newspaper looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings on behind the scenes and from there jerry draws his conclusions upstanding citizen that he is he tries to convince alice sutton julia roberts of the justice department that the president must be warned lucky gal alice who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since what she doesn t know is that jerry s interest in her is far more than well professional he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry s ideas and his limited circulation conspiracy theory newsletter he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice s help one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action nor a significant number of thrills part of this is a result of the film s slow pace it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that is over with the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement at over two hours this film could have been significantly condensed and had it s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour but even then the action scenes would not be able to save the film instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces we re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite black elements black helicopter men in black action suits and body armor black vehicles you know the drill they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time big deal we ve seen it all before watching the film i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination but i was out of luck now when i say it took forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice i completely mean what one person is relative to the other and not romantic involvement oh donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring you see there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies also directed by donner than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory the two just don t click and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether like finding out he s been stalking her the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced the script in general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it then took it and forced it upon us dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable to the point that i almost stopped listening even gibson s usual gift for ad lib couldn t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest although one of jerry s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing unfortunately much of what s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what s going on but instead filler that starts out with potential but ends up just being extraneous because it s never followed through for example jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break hence the water in a subway station and that the coroner should check the man s lungs for chlorine this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him you know what happens then nothing zip nada no follow up whatsoever so what s the significance okay here s another one a couple of well known real life assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j d salinger novel the catcher in the rye jerry also has a bunch of copies whenever he goes into a bookstore he has to buy one leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin we re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin not when we find out about his salinger collection not when he goes to the bookstore not later on when we get the answer to our first question the point becomes totally extraneous oh did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film yeah he plays this government psychiatrist named dr jonas who may or may not be a bad guy that s about it for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has he s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory you can just lump him in with the supporting players with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi this guy was really likable and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time okay here s my theory this really started out as a great film but some of its jokes were actually true the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security and this was what was left over 
out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey a cold uninvolving confusing new thriller though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard author of out of sight as well as jackie brown get shorty and pulp fiction after you watch it you realize that it s not nearly good enough in an aggressively non linear fashion the limey li mey noun an english gentleman tells the story of wilson terrence stamp a british ex con just released from a year stint in prison for armed robbery he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny he doesn t know much about the circumstances of her demise all he has is a name terry valentine valentine was jenny s former boyfriend a wealthy and corrupt record executive he s played by peter fonda in his first major role since the terrific ulee s gold in seeking valentine s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party he winds up breaking his cover eventually setting off valentine s head of security and valentine himself who decides to run for it what a mess i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time pulp fiction which twisted time every which way was a masterpiece but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer the limey does exactly that the plot is permeated with flashbacks flash forwards and what can only be described as random time travel without any evident purpose there is no method to this movie s madness it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably the plot isn t particularly interesting in the first place traditional mildly hackneyed and not very involving this is a sort of brooding film our protagonist doesn t speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude i felt like the director wasn t very interested in the proceedings himself almost like he made this film for a paycheck ditto for the editing which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal he s not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor he s shy quiet but always effective he s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression his feelings don t always show on his face by you can always tell what they are this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion why soderbergh couldn t just parrot down and tell a story i don t know but what he does do certainly doesn t work the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil even the action scenes don t work may have signified the death of the traditional act one act two act three storyline but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it shall we go back to basics 
despite its exceedingly well done visual effects s original species was one big hunk of sci fi cheese from the writing to the feeble performances so coming from such b grade roots its sequel s stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising yet at the same time it is it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad if not even worse something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien human hybrid sil is never entered into perhaps that was left for species iii though i m not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own the alien fun and games begin this time when a three person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain patrick ross justin lazard late of cbs s short lived soap of a few years back central park west cpw this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film s sil but it s close enough and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find meanwhile scientist dr laura baker the returning marg helgenberger has created a clone of sil named eve natasha henstridge again for research purposes it doesn t take long for eve to sense another alien presence which send her libido into hyperdrive it s up to laura and her former partner bounty hunter press lennox michael madsen another returnee and patrick s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble mykelti williamson to find patrick before the in heat eve does this isn t the x files goddammit exclaims one character in the early going in terms of quality he s absolutely right but he s also wrong the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick s pupils to dilate once he s infected looks and sounds an awful lot like the x files s black cancer to me but that s not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from species was already a ripoff of alien but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original s director roger donaldson did human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve s alien body which ironically was designed by alien designer h r giger a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns aliens sans flamethrowers the visual effects were by far the best thing about species and the sequel s effects crew at steve johnson s xfx inc keeps that high quality tradition alive no cheap looking lost in space cgi here after the effects the original s best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge however medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment at one point she s called on to play alien empath la forest whitaker in the original but for most of the duration she s holed up in a glass cell by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place the film is well into its home stretch so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick played with little zest by lazard one problem with the first film was that the deadly horny but innocent at heart sil was too sympathetic no such problem with patrick who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control the rest of the cast also fails to add much but the writing can be faulted for that helgenberger and madsen go through the motions but they are already hampered by the clich d development that somewhere between the two films the once linked laura and press stopped getting along williamson suffers the worst indignity he tries his best to enliven the token african american role but how can anyone recite insulting derivative lines such as i m gonna get african on someone s ass and not appear ridiculous but species ii s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work at least the original featured plenty to laugh at unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker and the sight of helgenberger s character performing fellatio on madsen s for a start but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level for all the blood and gore nudity and sex thrown in species ii is quite simply a vapid bore 
movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past so undoubtedly one day someone said evolution it s ghostbusters plus men in black plus tremors and so it is sum total none the alienbusting begins when a meteor lands in glen canyon arizona community college science profs ira kane david duchovny and harry block orlando jones take some samples from the meteor and discover that one celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth just about the time i was wondering hey doesn t the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies the government came in and took over the whole area the leader of the pack gen woodman ted levine turns out to be an old nemesis of ira s and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research meanwhile the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people by this time ira and harry have gained a friend in dr allison reed julianne moore of the center for disease control a country club poolboy wayne green seann william scott has also attached himself to the merry band but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit s ghostbusters but evolution falls miserably short one reason is readily apparent ghostbusters had three really funny guys as its scientists bill murray dan aykroyd and harold ramis but evolution has one really funny guy orlando jones who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else s hands for good measure ghostbusters had the comic talents of rick moranis evolution offers seann william scott who was much funnier in american pie and road trip than he is here scott has one amusing scene where he sings you are so beautiful to me to a dragon like alien to draw it into a trap other than that scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him an actor in search of a forte david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in playing god and his romantic side in return to me now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent what we all find is that he doesn t have any look for him to be back on tv in five years or so another sad case is julianne moore who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts she s a talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy her character has a tendency to trip over and bump into things but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs the sole saving grace of the film is jones he s at the center of the movie s funniest scene where an alien bug invades harry s body and has to be pulled out through his ass jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it but he can t carry the whole movie by himself he found himself in a similar situation in the replacements where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast jones will eventually find the project that will make him a major comedy star but this isn t it 
it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today s movies or novels you must suspend disbelief however there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg indiana where the film is set does not have a mcdonald s a sears store a statue of a man on a horse nor even a dam close by even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies even though the dam is crucial to hard rain s plot there is still a bunch of things that just don t gel firstly morgan freeman possibly the greatest actor alive after such films as driving miss daisy the shawshank redemption and se en was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement he should have played the town sheriff an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them and it seems a tad strange that an entire town with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way can vanish before the flood has actually started but nether the less armored guard couriers tom christian slater and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads it doesn t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road jim morgan freeman and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars but of course tom is more than willing to save the day so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town the local sheriff randy quaid whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id and a couple of police men investigate the situation but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he she would do with their share of the three million dollars director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy turvy and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies there are numerous twists in it s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience but by the time these interesting changes occur it s far too late in the film for them to have much affect hard rain s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had and although it s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected such titles as broken arrow slater and john travolta and face off nicholas cage and john travolta come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations strangely enough they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow my answer would have been a definite no i now know that he has no excuse and can do better if you don t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store although hard rain never really works from the start i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen the addition of an enticing sub plot would have given the film time to breathe rather than try to cram minutes of action and disaster into a story that can t handle anything else despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors but it doesn t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about is compare this to other films 
a big house a big director jan de bont of speed and twister fame a big star catherine zeta jones hot of the heels of entrapment and zorro a big remake of the haunting and big special effects so what do they all amount to unfortunately for us a big bore plot a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old spooky mansion for controlled testing unbeknownst to the patients the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear critique this movie just didn t scare me one bit sure it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there but on the whole it took waaaaay too long to get going provided very little meat in the plot went way past its own bedtime and basically relied on grunts the muttering of children s voices and over the top special effects to scare us well this film didn t do much for me and they might as well have called it the haunting of lily taylor since she s basically the only character who had any real depth background or reason to be in the house in the first place don t get me wrong catherine zeta was sweet window dressing despite my continued perception of her faint mustache see entrapment and owen wilson was good as the standard comic relief but come on people if you re going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks how bout giving them a little more than one liners as dimension neeson was also wasted as the smart british guy it s all too sad cause certainly the idea seemed like a good one see the shining for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry but the story was thin the conclusion was laughable be gone poof and the special effects well they sure were nice to look at but not for a moment did one of them scare or even for a split second have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry see it for zeta jones or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going and provide very little payback otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld the shining little known facts about this film and its stars goofy actor owen wilson co scripted indie favorites rushmore and bottle rocket with director wes anderson his brother luke wilson is also an actor who once dated drew barrymore for a year or so brother andrew is also an actor singer lisa loeb is listed in the credits as having portrayed the character of olivia morice but i personally did not notice her she is well known for her number one single stay i missed you and goofy glasses the creaks and moans heard throughout the house were prerecorded and played during filming in order to get a more natural expression of fear out of the actors catherine zeta jones is currently dating flabby ass actor michael sex is my life douglas she stands in actor michael rapaport pleaded guilty to the aggravated harassment of lily taylor he was ordered to stay away from her and undergo counseling for one year actor bruce dern who plays the throwaway role of the gatekeeper in this film was once nominated for an oscar for best supporting actor for his role in coming home director jan de bont was born in holland and began his lengthy career as a cinematographer on films as die hard hunt for red october and basic instinct directed by another dutchman paul verhoeven actor todd field also played a small but pivotal role in stanley kubrick s last film eyes wide shut he was nick nightingale the pianist this film was originally titled the haunting of hill house 
 s major league was a delightful surprise i didn t expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable but it proved to be fresh and funny however when the appeal of a movie is its freshness the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale that s certainly true of major league ii and the most recent entry major league back to the minors the title is of course a contradiction shouldn t it be minor league that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger who returned for major league ii are not around leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie the other veterans who return dennis haysbert as voodoo inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka who was introduced in league ii seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell scott bakula who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn bernsen to manage the twins aaa team the buzz you can write the movie from here he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win there s a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing walton goggins an ex ballet dancer kenneth johnson a broken down old timer thom barry twin outfielders both named juan the difilippo triplets and a couple pitchers with throwing problems judson mills and peter mackenzie along the way gus picks up cerrano and tanaka gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs even though he wasn t in either of the preceding films sum total none the entire enterprise is artificial and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors gus antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ted mcginley leonard is a slimy sniveling little egotist and the twins are lazy spoiled and full of themselves even watching the first movie i wondered why any real life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner gus challenges leonard to a match the buzz vs the twins wanna guess who wins back to the minors is a movie that has no reason to exist there s hardly a laugh in it the cast is weak and the first movie left no room for even one sequel 
the above is dialogue from this film taken almost completely in context and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously mr gregg i m having a mid life crisis araki the writer and director of this film wants to show how important teenagers are and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible horrible world and how does he show it by really cheap surrealism and moronic exchanges like this oh and it gets better a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of oh i dunno the fiftieth sex scene in this film i m not counting the several masturbation scenes in it one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another and he says to her something along the lines of do you ever wonder what life is all about sorry man foreplay takes place before the act of coitus of course what do you expect the film was written and directed by a guy who can t even spell his first name right yes i know it s a cheap joke but it had to be done the doom generation is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them and also as another teen angst film one of the slogans is teen is a four letter word hardy har har it s a film about two angsty teens amy blue rose macgowan who would later play the buxom tatum in scream and jordon white james duval who would go on to play randy quaid s son in independence day who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac xavier red jonathan schaech who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in that thing you do and by the way do you get the symbolism red white and blue huh huh and go on a road trip where three things happen in no order they have sex they run into weird people they kill them the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films gregg araki obviously has seen such films as easy rider natural born killers and kalifornia and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper the doom generation doesn t want to do this it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level he wants to show everything in a weird manner and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about here s one scene an earlier scene in the film amy and jordan go into a quick e mart type place to get food and other stuff amy is smoking and the clerk an asian man mind you i love how racist this film is i really do tells her to put it out she tells him to fuck off or something to that note he points a shotgun at her and she puts it out reluctantly jordan makes two hot dogs and takes them to the counter the cash register rings up oh and this symbolism doesn t stop here jordan checks for his wallet but it s really in the car he asks amy for it but she left her wallet in the car as well the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money they say they don t have it he gets ready to kill them but then xavier who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before pops out of nowhere fights with the clerk and ends with him blowing the clerk s head clean off clean wound mind you the head is shown flying through the air and lands in a fryer where it begins to scream i don t really object to this kind of sick violence but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only to gross you out araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme he ll make some kind of art wrong it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art when george romero made dawn of the dead a very gory flick even for today he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick same goes for peter jackson s disgustingly gory dead alive which features a minute long fest of blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing and other assorted stuff all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body taking out all sorts of zombies it was sick but it was also satirical and controled a scene like this has no purpose in the film and it sticks out from everything else that happens here s a couple other scenes jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches masturbates and then licks the semen from his hand xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window masturbates and falls backwards a man attacks the trio and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword put there just so this could happen a fast food employee stalks the trio and his arm is shot off by xavier and various other annoyances also look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people who probably didn t really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it just like peter o toole helen mirren malcolm macdowell and john gielgud probably didn t when they signed to be in caligula people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel hollywood madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line why are they here so that we can all point to them and say hey look it s fill in the blank wow gimme a break the film s meaning is pretty easy to detect that you know teens are so precious and the world is such a horrible place that when the two entities collide there s a giant explosion of horrific violence otherwise defined as teen angst or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you look i m years old i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did i ve since moved on to i don t really know what to do with my life phase but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse part of being a teen is experimenting and testing the waters it s not whining about how awful parents are and purposely feeling dispondent this is what the characters in this film do and the film wants to show how they re these great people who are being punished by the world because they re teenagers and how they try to defend themselves but can t totally overcome them it s not their fault they kill people it s the world s what they really need is a reality check the world is a bad place and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed and there s nothing they can do about it hence the title not only does it have bad fallacy but it can t even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner everything s overly surreal and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction he d show them for what they really are and if he didn t want the satirical approach he d show the real problems with the world and if you still don t think that the doom generation is incompetent on every single possible level it could be take the acting rose macgowan is horrible yes she proved herself talented in scream but she s so bad in the doom generation that if i had not seen her in scream i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today her entire performance is one note bitchy and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it s laughable equally bad is jonathan schaech who wants to be the slacker serial killer someone who doesn t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain his performance is annoying as hell and granted he was better in that thing you do and then there s james duval let s just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando he has the same kind of slacker stuttering only much much much worse and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him least talented actor in the world i have seen lots of bad actors but james duval has got to be the worst or at least somewhere up there here s another example of a bad scene if you re still not convinced the film opens up in a club where they re playing nine inch nail s most banal song heresy example of the lines god is dead and no one cares if there is a hell i ll see you there and as the song plays and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing the film pans over to amy just standing there looking dispondent the film closes in on her she looks right at the camera and says fuck no explanation of this should be necessary and finally a note to gregg grow up really move out of your parent s basement read something other than salinger and get a day job and don t quit it 
i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard the problem is i can t remember them as i write this review that s not a good sign in booty call jamie foxx is bunz a character whom i can t really describe because i don t know that much about him i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk and that he doesn t like relationships just booty calls at three in the morning no questions no commitment bunz has a best friend named rushon tommy davidson who seems to be bunz s direct opposite on the straight and narrow and currently in a long term commitment a whole seven weeks wow rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend nikki tamala jones but for a reason which is not totally explained it s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki s friend lysterine vivica a fox who have never met to make a long story short the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki s obsession with safe sex first she wants condoms so bunz and rushon go out and get them oh no they have to be latex not lambskin back to the store now they ve got to get dental dams or there ll be no foreplay why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand nikki phones lysterine who lives across the hall and tells her she d better be making these demands too talk about coitus interruptus booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over the top comedies the difference between the two is that in the latter things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality in this category for example you have ace ventura private eye on the mild side and airplane at the extreme there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention it is disappointing and even worse distracting there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker are those real names does not live up to its potential as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing for instance there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese much to everyone s surprise however when asked how he learned the language he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late night kung fu films and soon gained mastery this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene if on the other hand when asked how he learned to speak chinese bunz simply replied with kung fu movies and then moved on the joke would have been much more effective this is because it would have been totally unbelievable but funny because we know it is unbelievable by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible the film is not giving its viewers enough credit the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex why doesn t she have some condoms at her own apartment these questions are not answered by the screenplay but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language some movies use a lot of swear words but use them under very justifiable circumstances as when they are employed consistent with a character s pattern of speech other films such as the recent jackie brown use them in ways that almost parody themselves booty call just sticks them in to get laughs and it doesn t work they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason the chinese restaurant a holdup at a convenience store and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story and are in there for filler this is surprising considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long it s too bad that the core of the film isn t much better since it is comprised of sometimes funny but forgettable dialog i refer you to the first paragraph of this review 
wolfgang petersen s latest the perfect storm is like a pineapple it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging if you try to eat the fruit spikes and all it s going to hurt quite a bit ok maybe that was a confusing analogy so here s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick there isn t really much of a story to tell basically a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat called the andrea gail and gets stuck in the middle of the storm of the century how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story not nearly enough so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous audiences want to see the storm they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched maudlin drivel the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect but just try lasting the first three quarters i have yet to read sebastian junger s the perfect storm but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale based on a true story the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version the approach is weak using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner petersen almost hides the in your face banality right away the central characters are introduced the gritty determined captain george clooney the ingenue mark wahlberg torn between his job and his girlfriend diane lane the loving father john c reilly the comic relief who s always trying to get laid john hawkes the new guy william fichtner who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet french guy allen payne so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer it is not the all star cast s fault just the characters designed for their portrayal allen payne s character never speaks in the entire movie not because he is mute but because he s never given any lines are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with fichtner s character is terribly underdeveloped we don t know what he s doing there where he s from or who he s supposed to be the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene you know what would look good on you me ooooh real creative as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters the crew continues to not feel human only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk the computer generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real i can only imagine if this was an imax film this city kid would surely never go in the water again this is loud jolting entertainment adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so i guess i ll stick to that other survival spectacle you know the one on cbs 
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible director john woo the killer hard boiled face off appears to have made an exciting elegant charming spy thriller kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american read unsophisticated hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them sadly as the picture progresses the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up two hour long episode of magyuver and not a particularly good one at that what went wrong mi begins flashily enough that initial flash leading us to believe that it ll soon give way to something of a plot but it only gives way to more flash then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise s firing gun just so they can die really cool early on during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt tom cruise and nyah nordoff hall thandie newton woo works some of his trademark magic in one hypnotic though completely inexplicable sequence the director slows the action down to a languid semi stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other s eyes with come hither sexuality just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain sans scaffolding then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another why i haven t the foggiest i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply with mi woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects it s possible that these spies could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off though of course this is never explored the scenes i ve described are really only included to titillate not to give any insight into character god forbid woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial like visuals still in terms of crackerjack eye candy the opening has much to cherish cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is between the frantic dancing woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa kind of way yet it has style and something of soul and woo casts a bit of a spell on us sure it s all smoke and mirrors but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres newton bats her eyes flirtatiously cruise grins a little too slyly the cruise character ethan hunt has been drastically altered since the first film here cruise plays him more as a hip sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part he s cool and dashing which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film and blustered his way through magnolia quite possibly the most overrated performance of the s sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise s initial i m the man charm and more slo mo close ups of his preening mug mi falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won t stop the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle the first gun fight in the film which really should be unheard of in a john woo film but alas this particular battle could ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi of course excepting the symbolic pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture we ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand it isn t done any differently here the action is pure hard target broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind he s cool for sure but he s made to be as empty as the movie the actor isn t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment be it during a gunfight before one or after one when he s not beaming away he s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell but woo s editing seriously undermines the effort he fetishizes cruise s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he s really austin powers in a classic woo action moment ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin up boy angel of death the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does the lead bad guy played by the appropriately british dougray scott and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken on motorcycles though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug only to fly about a hundred feet still in bear hug position land on a beach below and begin a mano e mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a so you thought i was dead not to worry cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat what a hero you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi s plot my reasoning is simple i m not sure of any good it would do the film itself has absolutely no concern with story only with hurtling forth to the next special effect i wasn t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi has less plot than the average aerosmith video nobody will go to this for the plot and if they do they ll surely regret it as summer movies evolve or devolve character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing in mi the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma s that film s director stylistic flourishes while in mi the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo s non stop masturbatory pandemonium it s irrelevant in every sense as is character all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors 
there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director of course his best film was s masterpiece halloween but he also made s the fog and s underrated prince of darkness heck he even made a good film in with in the mouth of madness but something terribly wrong happened to him in with the terrible comedy memoirs of an invisible man somehow carpenter has lost his touch with junk like his failed remake of village of the damned to his uninspired sequel escape from l a those movies however look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film john carpenter s vampires if i was him i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as vampires the story is simple jack crow james woods is a vampire hunter who along with one of his partners montoya daniel baldwin and a prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives an attack from the master vampire valek thomas ian griffith since katrina was previously bitten by him crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her it seems valek s mission is to steal a black wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him my question is how many time have we seen this same story played out well the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made john carpenter s vampires sadly enough is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen in fact there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole minute running time the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed without any interesting camera work which is usually a trademark of carpenter s and then we come to the screenplay which as far as i can tell is nearly non existent there is no story development and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters james woods can be a good actor but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of pseudo clever lines of dialogue daniel baldwin has some potential but his character comes off as being very dense and sheryl lee faring much better as laura palmer in twin peaks like all of the female characters plays an offensive stereotypical whore there is not an ounce of intelligence or excitement in john carpenter s vamires which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s he has said that he turned down directing halloween h because he couldn t work up any excitement for it and yet when asked about a vampires sequel he said he would be happy to do it i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent not to mention a significant number of iq points 
sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking take this film naked killer among it s ingredients are heavy doses of violence rape sequences straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls coarse language but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended one word penis that s it in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is penis it really restores you re faith in the system huh anyway that s just a side point when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip cool controversial thriller what they forgot to mention was that it isn t very good the plot involves male cop tinam simon yam investigating a series of brutal murders while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty chingmy yau who after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father falls in with professional killer sister cindy svenwara madoka realising kitty has potential cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity however in the course of his investigation tinam who believed kitty had disappeared runs into her again but isn t quite sure if it s her to complicate matters the actual serial killlers princess and baby who a former students of cindy and have been told to kill their old master and her new student from then the action ensues all in all this is not a well done movie the script is awful the direction all over the place the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain the shoot out in the car park is almost woo like in adrenaline the fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different let me put this way if you like action get something else if you like strong women in movies get something else if you have do decide between this and black cat for your hong kong female action don t get either even for curiosity value it just isn t worth it let s face it if ever the was a movie that became popular on it s subject alone this is it 
after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy i was ready for some mindless fun oh maybe something like tango cash maybe not mindless fun is one thing but brain dead slop is another matter altogether tango cash has lowest common denominator written all over it the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l a russell plays cash a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts stallone plays tango a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it he doesn t need the money in an effort to change his image stallone goes for a yuppie gq look in the film wearing spectacles and three piece suits the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names tango cash is unbearably noisy for starters there s harold faltermeyer s annoying synthesized score which gets old after four notes to make matters worse the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars the more the merrier in fact the movie begins with not one but two car chases there s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie screenwriter randy feldman s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it such as stallone s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent and stallone is no lawrence olivier it s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman s script and thinking i want to be in this movie the film s plot doesn t have one original bone in its body and again you have to point your finger at the screenwriting feldman s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book making tango cash altogether generic and predictable they simply could have called it action movie every character every twist and turn is stolen from television or from other movies adding insult to injury tango cash is about as believable as a road runner cartoon action movies don t have to be realistic but they should absorb you enough so that you re not thinking about the lack of realism the only artistic aspect of tango cash is the cinematography there are some spectacular shots especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires the film s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell unfortunately their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants the dialogue consists of nothing but one liners and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing it s a shame because with a workable screenplay russell and stallone could have turned tango cash into a charming lethal weaponesque adventure tango cash tries to maintain a light tone and you do laugh about once every five minutes seeing russell in drag is the movie s funniest moment but you probably already have seen it in the commercials furthermore the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence machine guns and torture generally don t mix well with comedy jack palance appears in tango cash doing what he does best playing a sleazy conniving villain his character however is run of the mill except for his strange obsession with mice like many movie villains palance likes to play games in fact he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room you have to wonder why palance doesn t just shoot the detectives in the head the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent teri hatcher plays stallone s sister and russell s love interest and she is just as pretty as can be but regrettably hatcher s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty every time she opens her mouth you cringe corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination there s really very little if anything to recommend in the film and more to the point tango definitely isn t worth a penny of your cash so don t bother 
ironically one of the themes of cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest because i spent otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for a movie actually smoking cigarettes in the same minutes couldn t be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie not only is it a pathetically bad film overall but cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles a home video it is december and the big party is at monica s martha plimpton house but no one has arrived yet her invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total strangers but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night s end those who are invited are the ones that have the issues it is up to those who aren t to help them come to terms first there is eric brian mccardie who is a former boyfriend of monica s and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof he is one of the most bland characters in a film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical a common trait of this poor production bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year s eve and tag along to the party with them they stumble across a nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school his lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub standard comedy moving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts val is monica s cousin and a true fan of the new york scene on the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can t find paradoxically it is punks that they meet at a bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but aren t successful who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot wisely the movie s creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship however the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening finally there are the two worst performances and worst sub plot of the film jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy s virginity the night before while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy very often when a film is as putrid as this production there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory however this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted instead what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies first and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot at other times objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot there are also at least scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver and yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots perhaps if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even a decent plot payoff at the end but it didn t happen that way the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight 
synopsis when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert community college professors ira kane duchovny and harry block jones are first on the scene they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate soon the army advised by dr allison reed moore moves in and forces kane and block out but when the aliens begin to menace society it may take the scientists combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform humanity review evolution certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy it s directed by reitman clearly trying to parlay his ghostbusters success into a twenty first century counterpart it stars duchovny and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his x files character so soon after leaving the tv series it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition and then there s moore who may not have much prior experience in comedy but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress a shame then that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass evolution is a movie more concerned with its special effects which are quite good than anything resembling a consistently funny script it has its moments a scene in which jones body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour moore is totally wasted her clumsy shtick getting very old very fast duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with and the story is so formulaic it could have been written by monkeys part of what made ghostbusters so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for evolution is so mind numbingly tedious that it s difficult not to start cheering for the aliens 
i can t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota for forty minutes or so i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over wrought romantic comedy and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt then rather suddenly i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence shortly thereafter i was whacked in the gut by another feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated as though i had trusted writer director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie cameron diaz who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red delroy lindo suspects her of stealing from him red s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper sam clayton vincent d onofrio who is far from the man of freddie s dreams enter jjaks keanu reeves sam s estranged younger brother who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam jjaks and freddie take off together but sam isn t ready to let them go without a fight freddie meanwhile isn t ready to let sam s money go without a fight and thus begins a series of violent confrontations there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam s intense sibling rivalry as boys and their mother tuesday weld sending jjaks away to live with his father it does a great job of setting up jjaks unstable life a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family reeves wounded look is just right for jjaks the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin most important baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements i will dare on the car radio you would have every reason to expect that relationships both familial and romantic would be the focal point of feeling minnesota unfortunately you would be dead wrong i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding but i certainly didn t expect what i got what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality or rather creating gags about brutality suddenly the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another but there is no consistency to the characterizations vincent d onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam whose jealousy competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully jonathan demme s something wild and neil jordan s the crying game come to mind but they didn t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment i don t want to dismiss baigelman s successes out of hand he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop and some well crafted comic moments and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light hearted caper it is his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value and that he can t make his two halves into a whole feeling minnesota left me feeling used and there s not much funny about that 
one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself such was the case with boxing helena directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch daughter of the great david lynch made in the dying years of post twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs it was hyped as another warped twisted masterpiece of lynch clan kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract but the result was extremely disappointing film which quickly sank into well deserved oblivion the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh played by julian sands talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena sherilyn fenn beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re establish the relationship during one of such occasions helena is hit by a car and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her after she wakes up helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh s stylish residence but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping she is still trying to escape so cavanaugh takes off her arms apart from casting sherilyn fenn audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies this film by ms lynch hasn t got anything in common with the works of director s more talented father despite rather bizarre subject the style of this film is conventional and setting is light characters are beautiful but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos the actors aren t good either julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains being neurotic doesn t suit him bill paxton was better for this role but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena s boyfriend sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks but even the her greater effort in acting couldn t help this film the screenplay on the other hand is awful at least for someone who had made best seller with laura palmer s diary the events in this movie are implausible characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh s regular girlfriend played by betsy clarke the twist at the end although unpredictable is unbelievable and the viewers who had the stomach to endure entire film would feel cheated all in all boxing helena is disorganised quasi artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger s career 
not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie earlier this year nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year s least likeable comedies called hanging up featuring a bunch of annoying women ironically lisa kudrow played one in that film as well who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves ick real sweet stuff but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer with a film entitled battlefield earth i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film even if it was on a cheese factor as everybody and i mean everybody else pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time yipes another beauty so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co starring the ever versatile lisa kudrow uhhhm you guessed it not much plot in order to escape major financial difficulties a local weatherman hooks up with his ball picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery but as more and more people find out about their scheme more and more people demand a part of their winnings and more and more problems arise critique simply stated i didn t laugh once during this entire picture for a comedy it offered me a few smiles a bunch of nincompoops as characters a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow in what can only described as a sluttier version of her character of phoebe on tv s friends this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be but it was pretty close thankfully the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits dancing as the weatherman were left in the film s trailer and not in this final cut and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far beautiful this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast foremost was travolta s character who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie and for me the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong he didn t fit the part i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role a cool calculating roughneck with a certain hip suave je ne sais quoi in this film he looks like he s trying to be funny trying to be bad trying to be good we re not supposed to be able to notice that and when we do at least in my case i consider it a wrong choice in casting add that to lisa kudrow boring us with yet another one of her patented dumb blonde routines but this time dressed in sexier outfits michael rapaport stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn t quite up at the same speed level as everyone else and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells and you ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half interesting and never really bored me i also liked michael moore s perverted cousin character and i loved and i say it again loved the character that bill pullman played give this dude his own movie he played a lazy cop a man who tries everything not to do any real work he fakes injuries to get off duty tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won t have to fill out any forms now there s a base of humor sadly the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film and there s not much else i can say about this movie folks on the whole it was lame included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines and very little of interest for any target audience but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i m there 
and i thought stigmata would be the worst religiously oriented thriller released this year turns out i was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and self important end of days is completely inept on all fronts it s a silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best it s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesn t count is no fun at all end of days is a major stinker the movie opens in vatican city some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between and midnight on december the world will be destroyed the pope orders protection of this girl though some priests believe she ought to be killed in new york that very night a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy twenty years later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger a suicidal ex cop with a drinking problem now working as a security guard for hire he is protecting a local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her there are so many problems with this film it s hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with schwarzenegger is a persona not an actor so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions in other words trying to give him dimension was a mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role they ve all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho s character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine s location by offering him his old life back none of these scenes really work because arnie isn t up to the task the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before this one isn t at all believable the way arnold plays him the supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all as the prince of darkness he s suave and confident he acts like one would expect the devil to act the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him as a powerful villain byrne out performs arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrne s speech about the bible being overrated actually starts to make sense mainly because arnold s attempts at refuting it mostly of the tis not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold has to win so in the end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jericho s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks he disappears after about an hour robin tunney isn t given much to do except look scared in fact all of the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do performances aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster it s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which starts off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is it s utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new year s eve because it s exactly years after the year of the devil which isn t it turns out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is so just add a to the beginning and you ve got if you don t buy this explanation you re not alone it s convoluted and silly at the same time the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous she s christine see and she lives in new york see and if that weren t bad enough there s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn t explained at all why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex cop he s powerless is he impervious to only one kind of bullet how come he can t control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this but it s never actually explained usually this sort of thing wouldn t matter in a schwarzenegger flick i mean don t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich s present in end of days complete with the old black cat hiding in a cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there it gets so formulaic that it s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a boo will come their predictions will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because we don t care about these characters due to the script s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup and also because they too don t make any sense there s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady it s good for a few chuckles but not much else supposedly we re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never sets that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it s often hard to tell why it s happening in the first place not to mention that they re edited in full on incomprehensible mtv quick cut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of days is not only silly and confusing but it s also distinctly unpleasant to watch the devil apparently doesn t operate in the more subtle i ll convince people to kill each other fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this doesn t only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also means that not a single scene in end of days goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed to be shocking it s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb scenes aren t connected through any reasonable means so a lot of the time stuff gets blown up or people get killed and i had no idea why reasons to hell with reasons let s just blow stuff up isn t it cool nope not by a long shot this film is thoroughly unwatchable it s dull interminable and unrelenting in its stupidity perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career because it s not happening with hack peter hyams here end of days might have had camp value if only it didn t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody s going to buy if the movie is going to be serious the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script if it s going to be campy arnold shouldn t be taking himself so damn seriously i didn t actually see him put up on a cross did i and his character shouldn t be such a sad sack as it stands end of days is just a bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that 
yet another brainless teen flick this one is about surprise drugs and sex stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn t look more bored their characters are cardboard cut outs of every cliched teenager out there one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie everything about it annoyed the hell out of me the acting and script the plot and ending the director of the fluke hit swingers could have very well directed a bunch of no name actors and had a watchabe film the big stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality i felt like i was watching dawson s creek episode although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast the surprise ending was sooo predictable since when is a male character s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore go is dawson s creek varsity blues she s all that go home and watch something else 
mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla his entrance however is a grand one out from the trees he leaps gargantuan and imposing sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have joe bellows at the poachers before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars during this scene i turned to my friend and said wow that s some ape joe is quite a gorilla a big digital gorilla he runs around the fields chasing cars and people he picks things up and stares at them pensively he breaks things on accident because he s just too big to avoid clumsiness joe as a special effect is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes as a character he doesn t quite register and the story he s been put in is as limp as they come the words family entertainment have never been a stamp of quality but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart the picture is a remake of the film it s mostly just about the big gorilla but strictly as a formality the movie also has a few human characters the main one is jill young poor charlize theron forced to waste her talent a lover of gorillas as a child she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother now she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife specifically she s out to protect joe a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood soon zoologist gregg o hara bill paxton discovers joe he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser rade sherbedgia who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill s mother so in an effort to save joe jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers in addition the space is way too small for him after all he is a really big gorilla and to add to the complications strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill s mother jill of course doesn t recognize strasser even though he did kill her mother this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film the movie isn t really offensive it has some competent actors a few nifty sets and a lot of scenes with a big digitized gorilla but the story is really dumb there aren t any characters and the film isn t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals the movie also has bad dialogue if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue it s only fair to quote some of it but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like joe isn t happy and joe isn t safe here we need to get joe out of here joe is way too big for that cage i don t know if these phrases are word for word but they re close as i said the characters here are only present as a formality they do little more than state the obvious of course joe is too big for that cage paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them sadly mighty joe young wastes them both there are a few clever moments although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment and as i said the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes it s certainly not a bad film for kids i doubt joe will give them nightmares but adults in the audience aren t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while after that something needs to be done with the big gorilla nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned it s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor s first feature film dream with the fishes when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup any hopeful expectations however are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film s latter half the film s central characters are terry david arquette a depressed lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill nick lives in the apartment building across from terry who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nick casually asks for terry s wristwatch and eventually cons terry into a trade the watch for a bottle of pills of course terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch learning of nick s condition he only has a handful of weeks left terry s compassion kicks in and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick s lifelong fantasies and nick will fulfill terry s death wish by killing him this is a promising premise and mr taylor s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters terry is a repessed mournful character who wants to die while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits and where the straight laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character this is by the numbers plotting buddy movie road movie redux however dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline but by the characters which carry the story it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable unfortunately that is not the case here where both of the film s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits far from a romp this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond mr taylor s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived witness such lines as you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain see that s provocative leaves room for further questions the film enjoys a few inspired moments the urn scene a session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nick s acid trip but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes this occurs particularly often during the film s opening sequence as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital i m realising that this is intended to be funny although nary a smile crept upon my lips which is probably due to the obvious fact that it s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick s scheme of tricking him this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes the entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability among the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering fresh faced characters he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang s swimming with sharks who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry mr taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated as opposed to a bright crisp look for the smalltown scenes the charge of dream with the fishes s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters and indeed in many cases have i been in the minority supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult audience unfriendly nature of their characters for dream with the fishes though i did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die 
these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes but only a few years ago before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south the way to regain popularity and prestige they thought was the use the same formulas characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place one of such celebrity was eddie murphy black comedian of s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade in order to return to the spotlight he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film beverly hills cop action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in seven years later for the third instalment he used the directorial service of john landis another fading star with whom he successfully collaborated twice in trading places and coming to america this time however third time wasn t the charm and beverly hills iii was failure eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback eddie murphy here plays axel foley fast talking streetwise detroit policeman who raids illegal chop shop the routine police action ends in tragedy when the criminals kill foley s boss determined to bring the killers to justice foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald timothy carhart when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles foley goes back to los angeles there with the help of his old friend local policeman rosewood judge rheinhold foley would clash with money counterfeit ring ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different in this decade the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills which provided a lot of gags in film simply doesn t work screenwriter steven e de souza provides another conflict this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business like professionalism of the bad guys since foley belongs to the former his character had to watch his language and the tone of the film in general is more infantile unfortunately this film still belongs to action movie genre and there is too much violence for little children nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath unlike donner with the lethal weapon series landis simply can t balance the comedy with regular action and the result is a film that fails in both aspects action scenes are sometimes interesting but not too spectacular at the end scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself humour on the other hand falls flat to make even worse some minor characters from film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure especially art expert turned into arms dealer played by bronson pinchot in the end although the film provided some entertainment viewers at least critical ones would probably be happy to know that there aren t any plans for beverly hills iv 
 with all that education you should know what happiness is starring sylvia chang teresa hu hsu ming li lieh mao hsueh wei directed by edward yang written by yang and wu nien chen cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui kung every country has eventually its new wave france had its nouvelle vague brazil its cinema novo china its fifth generation and on and on some waves just take longer than others before they wash over us cleansing us with the balm of discovery taiwan s new wave came in the s in the work of directors like hou hsiao hsien wan jen and edward yang that day on the beach yang s first feature is central it created a new language for young taiwanese directors even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here giving taiwan a distinctive international presence that day itself is long and frustrating the document of a nation s attempt to find a voice it does not lack ambition it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan in the manner of antonioni elaborating the alienation that the westernized white collar middle class feel as their lives are shaped by old fashioned roles dedicated career men loyal housewives that they find unfulfilling jia li sylvia chang is the focus but the film brings others into its compass her husband her brother friends from her college days as it charts her discontents no one is happy jia li married her husband we lei at a young age at the time her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage despite his affection for another woman and so jia li s marriage seemed in comparison a good one she chose we lei of her own free will they loved each other but it goes wrong that day dutifully presents all the clich s we lei becomes absorbed in his career indulges in an affair with a co worker jia li feels restless and trapped bound by a choice she made while young but which no longer seems wise the film never redeems these clich s by conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured it unfolds awkwardly as a series of flashbacks told during a luncheon in vienna where jia li meets her brother s old flame teresa hu now a concert pianist whom she has not seen since college both women seem rather sad and resigned to their sadness their circumstances and those of jia li s brother and a college friend suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices married the wrong man chosen the wrong career path etc but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate it is not that jia li married the wrong man she didn t the problem is that she needed to marry at all and that if she did not marry she would still be just as unhappy for a woman in modern taiwan that day tells us the cards are stacked the dice are loaded she can play the game but the house always wins the film s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan seen now it does not seem provocative indeed it s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy it may be ambitious it may be innovative but it is also terribly terribly dull and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others and his use of those methods is fumbling uncertain undisciplined nor does he bring anything new other than the locale to the material there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for in a young couple s first kiss in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband s mistress but they are brief too often yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes grocery shopping flower arranging in which nothing happens little is said no emotion imparted perhaps if the film were content to focus on such reflective inward moments leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings it might have been ambiguous suggestive insinuating but jia li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence they talk about their problems at length in detail redundantly and eliminate all subtleties at two hours and forty five minutes it all seems exorbitantly long indulgently long winded consider the defining moment for jia li the titular day on the beach the thrust of the whole film explains easily enough what we are to think of that moment what it means when she walks away from a particular situation even so the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally in case we may have missed the point needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed and that is the problem throughout the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn out narrative it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle at least it s his name in the credits who is now rightly regarded as one of the world s leading cinematographers in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar wai he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image you would never know it from watching that day which due either to doyle s inexperience or yang s humdrum direction is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience but none of the damage none of the heartbreak 
well here s a distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually a box office hit at the time of its release after just viewing the film for the first time my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of enjoy this movie it is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was at least some smut would have livened things up a bit porky s tells the story if you can call it that of four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want to get laid women for the most part are a mystery to them and in this movie they are to the audience as well since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet their plan is sidetracked however when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky s which they are able to get into using fake id s after they pay the manager one hundred bucks for three hookers they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building for these four teenage guys this means war on porky s porky s ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level as a teenage sex romp it is not wild or amusing enough as a comedy all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat as a look back at the s it is something i suspect most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave and as a revenge movie it is a crushing bore one of the most offensive things about porky s is how jaw droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters and we learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool that sure is revealing information the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark the women are all treated as objects or comedy props rather than real people for example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that is to be made fun of mrs balbricker is a gruff no holds barred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses even though i have the suspicion they are not but one thing is for sure they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny only humiliating to prove how out of touch this so called comedy is compare it to other more serious s films about teenagers and it looks even worse in comaprison any of the john hughes pictures such as s sixteen candles or s the breakfast club put porky s at an even greater shame those films actually dealt with serious teen matters but remained a great deal funnier thanks to their bright and truthful writing and heck if porky s wanted to be a teenage sex movie i d take s fast times at ridgemont high or s the last american virgin over this any day of the week director bob clark is not a bad director two years after he made porky s he directed the nostalgic holiday classic a christmas story i would forgive him for this misfire in fact if it wasn t for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in porky s 
the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties produce something anything that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here gross humor sex jokes silly sight gags more sex jokes and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder grosser and more outrageous than that last film what the film is not however is funny the plot centers around the return of dr evil who goes back in time to steal austin powers mojo a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin s pelvis which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies austin must go after him and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews i wish i had stuck to my first impression myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation and he has the talent to do it at least as an actor but the material he is working with here much of it his own falls short of anything resembling comic genius this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces a five hundred pound fat man s butt crack and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average year old after some of these scenes one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor for the most part i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety the director just throws the material at us giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director i am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under crowd at least the one s who have yet to discover literacy certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as in your face kick you in the teeth take no prisoners action verb blah blah blah if you see the film and you find you re not laughing there is nothing wrong with you it just means you grew up since seventh grade

in my opinion a movie reviewer s most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion but with soul survivors i m so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous uncontrollable rant obligations damned however protocol forces me to do otherwise soul survivors tells the story of four college bound friends cassandra melissa sagemiller is sweet and innocent party girl annabel eliza dushku of bring it on is dating world weary harvard student matt wes bentley matt still has feelings for cassie who is now dating sean casey affleck driving back from a creepy gothic party the quartet gets into a horrific car crash sean dies leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her as cassie mopes through her classes she sees the ghost of sean all over the place urging her to follow him along with being plagued by other ghastly visions cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party annabel and matt try calming her down but no one shares cass s visions she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material in his directorial debut steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion when the movie s camerawork isn t pedestrian it s clich d carpenter s need for close ups his camera following sagemiller from behind drain the movie of any anticipation we already know what to look for so why should we be surprised and the sense of scary atmosphere which was recently done so well in the others is nowhere to be found here carpenter s script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around the second lamest device of course is the oh it was all a dream resolution and guess what this movie has both not that the main body of the film which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown is anything worthwhile since there s no captivating dialogue no character chemistry exists anywhere that s a huge problem since the four main characters are supposed to be couples carpenter can t even get the smutty scenes right which are becoming more prevalent in pg movies like bring it on and get over it the film was recently re cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats ed when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay style quick cuts and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint they re fully clothed regardless any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity why wouldn t they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine why would they shower in their clothes what if they weren t covered in latex paint the cast which will see better material in the future would be wise to leave this one off their resumes i felt sorry for affleck who i ve liked in other movies and bentley who was great in american beauty dushku who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan as for sagemiller star of the aforementioned get over it i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person and not an object for gawking and i m not even getting into luke wilson s role as a priest at least he s friends with wes anderson bottom line soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it 
the formula is simple trap a varied group of people on an isolated location then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one these have been the successful ingredients for many good films the thing alien aliens and tremors to name a few so why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad see the relic for a particularly putrid example perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient effort and ideas deep rising meets these two requirements part way but not enough to salvage the film treat williams is finnegan the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services and their boat for any activity no questions asked this time however they may have gone too far their passengers led by the ominous wes studi are the type of multi national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films and their cargo let s just say it has very high explosive potential what is the target of these thieves why the argonauticus of course a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage but something else is hunting the argonauticus something ancient and deadly by the time the thieves arrive nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed and now the creature senses fresh meat so you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew joining forces with the surviving passengers including the ship owner canton anthony heald and a thief with less lofty goals trillian famke janssen against the terror from the deep and the monster gets to pick them off one by one fortunately for the creature this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food if there s a more clarion call for unity i don t know what it might be it s pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end for the most part the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience s impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad treat williams is a passable hero and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way the biggest treat in the film however has to be pantucci kevin j o connor s whining engine boy under finnegan s employ his constant quips may be a bit over written but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens or todd graff as hippie in the abyss for that matter it s just a stock part the comic relief character but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable as far as the monster goes although the cgi is done well the creature has no logical consistency think back to the great or even just good movie monsters they all had a set of rules about what they could do and how and why they would do it part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering along with the heroes just what those rules are the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn t have a set of rules or if it does not a very good one it merely eats or drinks as the case may be and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place it simply happens the action scenes are decent but few are noteworthy the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic deep rising s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron s but can you really blame them unfortunately deep rising s efforts are more on par with speed on the plus side however the film s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting but unlikely sequel perhaps you d be better off waiting for that one

if anything stigmata should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close to one another of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst i suppose i should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir of echoes had its moments but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over clearly the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping is it then any surprise that stigmata is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe i have seen in a long while no not really patricia arquette plays frankie page a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe trotting mother as it turns out the rosary belonged to a recently deceased brazilian priest the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story considering she s an atheist but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on he eventually begins to suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church as it turns out the dead priest had been working on the translation of a fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video i mean film stigmata is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse indeed it would have been good if it were a music video because it s only interesting for about five minutes i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion double exposure and extreme close ups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he has been to film school his camera trickery is interesting for a little while but eventually it becomes headache inducing what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue such as it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see look at what i can do i m an ex cellent dir ect or maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow motion shots of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ooh scary if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery i didn t see it just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story here comes a double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if stigmata had a story or characters that were remotely engaging though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case in point frankie page is the character that i assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we aren t given any back story on her character or any reason to like her the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she s kind of cute so let s start the bleeding the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help either according to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back go clubbing sure that makes sense arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their characters are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon even more curiously he seems to be interested in her advances father andrew s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic as for pryce he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle i ll get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded trust me i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain what s worse after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction veers off in another then another and ends up being totally incomprehensible first of all the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary how come an atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata actually i m not sure what frankie was posessed by supposedly stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit i think which one is it the answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr wainwright wants to use this time furthermore the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap up and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church as the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library there s nothing the catholics need to worry about though stigmata s religion is so off base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns which would have been far more interesting i m not catholic in fact i don t care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means it s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as stigmata does it s not thought provoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretends to be i m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over like so many films of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill so much is overdone in stigmata that it eventually has no effect on the audience leaving us to pick out the film s many flaws i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earth shattering when we finally hear it the saying sounds like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school which means that for all its flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata is it 
vampire s is a rude chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse present only to pleasure men feed vampires readied to be bashed or beaten till one s sensibilities is shocked by the low iq and mentality of this regressive movie to make matters worse the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks and deserve to have their heads bitten off if not their bodies carved in half the dilemma of hating the heroes as much as the villains makes one wish that the hand of god would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion james wood portrays jack crow a man obsessed with killing vampires whose soul reason for living is based on revenge they killed his parents but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires as for adam baldwin he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts action and the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex as for the claims that the catholic church created dracula well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame an awful movie on all counts my suggestion is to bring back buffy and bury this group of incompetent rude vampire slayers 
arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts since the late s but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one liners are getting worse it s hard seeing arnold as mr freeze in batman and robin especially when he says tons of ice jokes but hey he got million what s it matter to him once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster that can t compare with the likes of the terminator series true lies and even eraser in this so called dark thriller the devil gabriel byrne has come upon earth to impregnate a woman robin tunney which happens every years and basically destroy the world but apparently god has chosen one man and that one man is jericho cane arnold himself with the help of a trusty sidekick kevin pollack they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world parts of this are actually so absurd that they would fit right in with dogma yes the film is that weak but it s better than the other blockbuster right now sleepy hollow but it makes the world is not enough look like a star film anyway this definitely doesn t seem like an arnold movie it just wasn t the type of film you can see him doing sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one liners but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going it s understandable especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources aside form that he still walked through it much like he has in the past few films i m sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days speaking of action where was it in this film there was hardly any explosions or fights the devil made a few places explode but arnold wasn t kicking some devil butt the ending was changed to make it more spiritual which undoubtedly ruined the film i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred but once again i was let down i also don t know why the film took so long and cost so much there was really no super affects at all unless you consider an invisible devil who was in it for minutes tops worth the overpriced budget the budget should have gone into a better script where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom it s pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie do they even read these things anymore it sure doesn t seem like it thankfully gabriel s performance gave some light to this poor film when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney you can t help but feel that he looked like a devil the guy is creepy looking anyway when it s all over you re just glad it s the end of the movie don t bother to see this if you re expecting a solid action flick because it s neither solid nor does it have action it s just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing due to a strategic marketing campaign save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience 
plot set in the future a courier has uploaded some data into a hard drive that resides in his head and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information since he overloaded his hard drive he s also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him critique incoherent boring one act drivel with no suspense horribly unbelievable futuristic environment bad dialogue career defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending it s too bad because the premise of the film was interesting but unfortunately for my friends and i this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us it s one of those films that makes you start laughing half way through when you realize that most of the actors in it suck the location shots are filmed in dark junkyard type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic whatever and all the sets look like well sets there is also absolutely no arc to this story it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings gibson should stick to writing novels and x files episodes since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass henry rollins as a pumped up cyber doctor or something and ice t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face don t ask the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point i m ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal canada but sadly enough for us all it was some of the cyber travelling special effects were okay hence the but overall it s one of those bad movies that s just funny to watch and cringe at thankfully for keanu he redeemed his sci fi career with s the matrix it s too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent little known facts about this film and its stars as of director robert longo never directed another full feature film hmmm now isn t that odd writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in after being rejected for the draft he lived in toronto at first but since has made vancouver his home his novel neuromancer and its sequels s count zero and s mona lisa overdrive are generally considered to be the definitive works of the cyberpunk science fiction sub genre this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the worst actor category in the razzie awards 
this movie stinks although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss i knew i was in for trouble when during the opening establishment shots we see a detailed close up of warrant officer paul brenner s john travolta military identification card and it is the wrong color this might seem like a minor detail but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training or what about when brenner tells a suspect that because he is in the military he doesn t have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through for example at the beginning of the film paul brenner an undercover army investigator gets into a gun and knife battle at his off post houseboat and winds up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing but instead of arresting him or at least take him into custody for further questioning they release him duh ultimately brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general s daughter a young captain also assigned to the post when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general s daughter does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects no his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing eventually brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier i won t even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army s suppression of this horrendous crime i will just mention one final flaw brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia the rape occurred in west point which is in new york he is under a very tight and totally implausible hour deadline to solve this case he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point does he phone the doctor no he travels via some unexplained very fast transport to new york to question the psychiatrist in person and then he returns to georgia again by the miracle transport without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline you have been warned stay away from this one 
tri star rated r language sexual situations violence minutes director and writer darren stein cast rose mcgowan rebecca gayheart judy greer julie benz chad christ ethan erickson carol kane pam grier tatyana m ali review by geoff berkshire jawbreaker is the very definition of a rip off this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie heathers and clueless and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich s along the way writer director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo judy greer about the four most popular girls at reagan high courtney shayne rose mcgowan who can basically be summed up as satan in heels julie freeman rebecca gayheart a good girl with the face of a supermodel marcie fox julie benz a dim witted blonde who demands that people call her foxy and liz purr charlotte roldan an angel in disguise liz is everyone s favorite because she s both beautiful and kind liz is about to turn and as a prank courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney s car but when they open it later polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment their lives will never be the same poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz s dead body courtney thinking fast decides to pass the death off as a rape murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into vylette hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students up until about this point the film is effective enough however an investigation begins into liz s death and the film becomes excessively dull the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch courtney s plan to frame a sleazy guy marilyn manson in a brief cameo is never believable for a second meanwhile the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack chad christ he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid fern s rise to popularity is equally lame we do get the best scene in the film the only one with a spark of originality during this section it s a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school s resident jock stud dane ethan erickson to demonstrate using a popsicle exactly what he would like for her to do to him it at least provides us with a look at courtney s personality but the way the scene finishes doesn t make any sense stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting william katt and p j soles students in carrie are liz s distraught parents jeff conaway from grease is julie s creepy single dad and carol kane the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls camps it up as principal miss sherman at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema s greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color director of photography amy vicent who beautifully lensed eve s bayou does a remarkable job here as well shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive performances are mostly sub par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments compared with her excellent work in the doom generation and scream and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress singer tatyana ali who has a small role as a cheerleader the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like auto stud college stud and high school stud the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen s catchy yoo hoo makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film 
my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills the corny dialog the ludicrous premises and the bad acting since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together i can t remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species came along he was not amused i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing insulting my intelligence and brought adequate movie making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made at least in terms of the craft the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque this movie slaps you with conception pregnancy delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames without pausing for infancy the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman s womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside out cesarean an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp it is used only after the skull has been exposed the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle as bad as it gets as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck eve natasha henstridge was cloned from sil the original alien sexual predator but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer marg helgenberger i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet it s enough to melt the most callous heart at another point she protests i m human too you know she is only half right peter medak the director knows his business justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials james cromwell his father is perfect in a short role marg heldenberger the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful natasha is an exquisite ornament george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up michael madsen was there black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits which is more that we can say for lazard 
i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuous enough on the surface romantic comedy it s not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa in a word it s the same thing that s wrong with so many movies circa writing more to the point it s the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you re telling a story about a relationship the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we re expected to get dewy eyed over any pairing of attractive pleasant people just because they re attractive and pleasant in this particular case attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon chris o donnell a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage it s a scary notion for jimmy even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne renee zellweger his girlfriend of three years convinced despite his reservations that it s time to sh t or get off the pot jimmy proposes to anne very badly anne refuses which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather peter ustinov dies and leaves a very specific video will jimmy stands to inhereit million if he is married by p m on his th birthday stays married for years and produces a child there are only a couple of minor problems jimmy s th birthday is the next day anne is nowhere to be found meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex girlfriends it s a wacky brewster s millions esque premise acknowledged as such in one of the film s better more self aware lines of dialogue the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters at least that would be the case if jimmy weren t already a world class altruist screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will if jimmy doesn t get married not only will he lose all the money but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him costing hudreds of jobs from the outset jimmy s motivation isn t cash it s the livelihoods of his devoted employees it s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor s plot development by any human standard the guy is impossibly selfless and that s the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness there s never any tension between the two star crossed lovers because there s no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake the blandly nice o donnell couldn t pull off a randy cad if he tried so the filmmakers don t even let him zellweger s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to but no one dares make her anything but the woman lightly wronged and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation the parade of sit com set pieces had better be damned funny since they re all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion i ll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing including ustinov s rantings about procreation and a restaurant full to bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly like the shudder inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church you re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor but that s not the real problem nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm n fuzzy conclusion it s leading up to the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm n fuzzy there s no spark no energy no humanity it s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer s digestions we ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don t even have a pulse the bachelor is love among the mannequins 
after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball fiercely unoriginal director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of a space odyssey instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie de palma stops right there refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart mission to mars takes it s first wobbly steps at a pre launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done during these surface scans of the characters we learn that jim mcconnell sinise has lost his wife it s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability there is no contentiousness no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff but in that movie the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects it s the year and this is nasa s first manned excursion to the red planet a crew led by luke graham cheadle arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly which they investigate with tragic results graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth in response earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell woody blake robbins wife terri fisher nielsen and phil ohlmyer o connell obstacles are put in the crew s way and and they matter of factly go about solving them i should say mcconnell goes about solving them time and again mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind which wouldn t be so bad if the rest of the crew didn t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew s mission and life is in mortal danger on a team of professionals she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character s personality trait by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush there is an adage in film to show don t tell mission to mars does both repeatedly characters obsessively explain the obvious explain their actions as they are doing them explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them the film s conclusion is momumentally derivative anti climatic and unsatisying as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film the best i could come up with is pre teen age boys but in this media saturated era this film s components would have been old hat even for them i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good modern day b movie the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material i felt no such earnestness 
ahh yes the teenage romance an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies and in the end the guy always gets the girl and with the arrival of the breakout hit she s all that last year followed by a long catalogue of imitators including things i hate about you and drive me crazy the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity along now comes down to you the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid she s all that craze with their latest project which has the studdly freddie prinze jr attached and all only down to you doesn t have the unlikely scenario mentioned above it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance a dull unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we re accustomed to this is the kind of romance that only giggly year old girls will find convincing in strictly textbook fashion college sophomore and aspiring chef al prinze jr meets freshman artist imogen julia stiles they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies from here it s the standard boy meets girl boy loses girl boy drinks entire bottle of shampoo and may or may not get girl back story the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters who are frequently taking part in activities that well only happen in the movies fortunately the cast of down to you has a certain appeal freddie prinze jr and julia stiles are an adorable couple and when on screen together they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around zak orth as the newly realized porn star monk shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film s intelligent dialogue rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy the faculty selma blair cruel intentions and ashton kutcher tv s that s shows even the fonz himself henry winkler the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia has a welcome role as al s dad the host of the popular cooking program chef ray maybe the concept of down to you looked good on paper to draw such a crowd as a feature film however the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely perhaps worst of all down to you is not funny the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired the characters on screen often laughing at each other s goofy embarrassing antics seemed far more amused than the audience even the giggly year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it s course the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr in a fantasy sequence called cooks a cops take off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for needy families with the assistance of a fully armed swat team of course when this is the highlight reel you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired in order to make a teen comedy work you ve got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity things i hate about you actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards and the result was refreshing no such luck with down to you it s just a textbook romance where despite absurd circumstances everything is bound to work out in the end and at the end of the whole clich d ordeal the nicest thing you could possibly say would be only in the movies 
starring arnold schwarzenegger danny devito emma thompson frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment and a big one at that junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins so foolish me i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins so much for hopes schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists doctors hesse and arbogast who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy unfortunately due to circumstances beyond their control they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans and subsequently lose their funding still believing that their drug will work they decide to test it anyway on hesse so dr hesse schwarzenegger artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying surely it will work on a woman does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you well it must have to the producers of junior admittedly schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny but it wasn t schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy and the accompanying emotional swings is not funny schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics i kept thinking to myself with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture better yet with schwarzenegger devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time why didn t they make a sequel to twins anything would have been better than this mess danny devito is wasted in this movie his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street after seeing the movie if i was devito i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street emma thompson is wasted here as well while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations she is also a fine comedian too bad she didn t get to use any of that talent here am i being too hard on this film i don t think so schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film they certainly managed here maybe it was well intentioned but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made if you are tempted to see this film do yourself a favor and go rent twins a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito s comedic talents 
this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i m not going to waste any more words on it 
 spawn may be somewhat of an older film in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn t seen it will finally get to see it that is if they see it but i managed to catch it before it made it s way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and god forbid video cassette purchasing it wasn t the worst film of year by any means it isn t even on the top of the worst films of the year but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten which in simpler terms means it comes in at number on my worst of list the only reason it doesn t come in lower is thanks to the special effects which might actually have been some of the best of the year performances however were either wooden or for the most part unforgivingly campy in fact this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality i don t know how to explain that one it wasn t exactly choppy but something about it seemed well annoyingly unprofessional john leguizamo almost makes it as clown but not quite he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional but the main problem i found with spawn as with most films that wind up on my worst of lists is that it was just plain boring i wouldn t even say there was a climax to the film sure it had the big battle scene at the end but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion never too soon the movie did conclude in a very simple disappointing way even though it s one of the shorter movies i ve seen this year it s one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again like i said the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride no matter how small i was impressed with the opening sequence so long as i didn t allow the melodramatic voice over and lobotomizing editing to get to me and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn s outfit created but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes which looked quite a bit like a modern video game who knows if spawn the video game wasn t part of the plan from the beginning keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable and in a very small amount makes up for the cheeziness of it all but none of this movie s saving graces can it make it something i d recommend seeing no matter what the price of admission this movie is definitely not for young children which shouldn t really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers if anyone would likely find it appealing if you really want to catch a movie there are many better ones out there no matter what your tastes might be trust me spawn has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers 
this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story however even if one thinks of it as fiction the prince of egypt remains shallow but i ll begin from the beginning the biggest difference between the original biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero maybe it s just me but if i knew i had god on my side i d have a little bit more confidence there are other differences as well such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah s death like it s nothing but a thing most of all though the story s focus has shifted rather than being a story about father son man ethnicity man god the prince of egypt is almost solely about the brother brother relationship between rameses and moses i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie where it came off as maudlin rameses and moses squabble like children and then in the interests of peace moses saves rameses butt even though moses was the one who started it yawn i didn t care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer which of course never happened in the original story moses was exiled but enough about the differences let s talk about the movie itself it features a moses who in the interests of making the character more human lacks any divinity whatsoever which isn t convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is it features a cookie cutter i wanna please dada rameses who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes from schindler s list among other things the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the new improved miriam voiced by the ever antsy sandra bullock even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason here bullock is replaced by a singing voice speaking of which it contains very annoying music it contains shallow writing it features extraordinary animation which is one good thing i can say about this film most of all it contains an attempt to commercialize homogenize and mass market a story about a manifestation of god i am not christian but i got the impression of blasphemy the writers and producers took a butcher knife and chop chopped into the story 
i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof we ll have a hit on our hands the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film a mishmash collage of one dimensional characters rampant stereotypes of cultures and races cliched emotional statements of purpose and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography the story is loosely based around the pro football players strike in and a rag tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels keanu reeves stars as shane falco a has been football college player looking for redemption gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers rounding out the cast includes swingers jon favreau up pitchman orlando jones gruff owner jack warden and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters the drunken welshman the overweight sumo wrestler the black convict the violent cop and the dumb dumb cheerleaders this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny s the usual things happen like clockwork the hero rises from the ashes of failure the team comes together in unity the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax it s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks howard deutch who was behind the camera for two of the best films of s pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes obviously the problem is that without a good script any director will fail in the end sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds the rise and fall of gallant heroes and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life the replacements offers none of this 
years ago robin williams made jumanji a brilliant achievement in special effects but a travesty on nearly every other level the same can be said for what dreams may come a boring illogical weepie wannabe that left my senses numb don t get me wrong i love breathtaking special effects and pulse pounding imagery brazil is on my personal top ten the city of lost children is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios i even love and last year at marienbad being in the minority amidst my friends what dreams may come imagery aside has little daring thought to complement its imagery the daring thought it does have is never fully realized it s idea of a plot is so lukewarm that it insults the bigger questions it raises it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences put on an electronica soundtrack and sell it as one of those popular mind s eye videos robin williams plays chris nielsen who dies too prematurely not only in the story but before we have a chance to really know and care for him the director vincent ward and the screenwriter ronald bass have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife big mistake it would have been far better to take the half hour or so needed to tell his life story first ala it s a wonderful life so that i can build up respect for him so i could know and possibly care for him his children and his long suffering wife played superbly by annabella sciorra instead the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses it doesn t so in the afterlife chris learns that a people still don t meet god b that our thoughts are reality and c time does not exist there hmm i ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative the not meeting god part still irks at me but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect that said this alternate reality still makes no possible sense read on chris wife commits suicide since suicides go to hell chris would be separated from his wife forever the important question is is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love good question and i like good thought provoking questions i don t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question i loathe it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously i really loathe it when it s story is no longer run by logic but by special effects hey chris did you forget your thoughts are real they are more real than the physical world according to the new age screenplay so why don t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie and let that run wild and then she would appear before you and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity because there would be no movie that s why and albert the angel played by miscast cuba gooding jr says bluntly that s fantasy umm if your thoughts are more real than the physical then fantasy is not fantasy but real surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person and that your thoughts aren t big enough to sustain you for eternity well in all due respect that s why i don t subscribe to this theology all due respect another idea based on time pause does not exist here so chris spend your eternity with annie as she is on earth reliving your favorite memories or hang out with her when she was growing up you ve got eternity perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out and forcing her to write i still exist in her diary imo is just too tacky there are many other ideas all of which are a hundred times better than what s unraveled in the plot the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before and just come out stale most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris life appear in heaven differently than he expects so when they finally show themselves he realizes they were with him all along and when this happens the film runs in slow motion as if to build emotion gag me with a spoon so the only things for me to like are sciorra s effective performance who rises far above this mundane material and the special effects please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals i did not enjoy all of them some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe everybody floating up and down in invisible strings it sounds like a joke but it s really true i really tried to block out the dialogue and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack my vote goes to a rare cd called never say die from petra a christian rock group it s pretty good and they have a song about annie who commits suicide it s too late for annie she s gone away for good there s so much we d have told her and now we wish we could but it s too late melancholic yes depressing yes but far more entertaining so in case you don t know let me be straight suicide bad don t do it no no no got it you shouldn t have to pay to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest 
when i originally saw the trailer for analyze this a few months ago i must admit i thought it looked kind of lame and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago i thought it looked outright bad but then when analyze this finally opened a few days ago an odd thing happened it got great reviews critics were proclaiming it hilarious and a dead on parody of mob movies well with praise like that i figured it must be good and so i headed off to the theater you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts well turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for analyze this is slow unfunny and badly acted don t get me wrong i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century but he is just out of his league here i think the problem is he didn t quite know how to approach this material he plays his character mob boss paull vitti somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama if he had played the character straight along the lines of leslie nielson in the naked gun series he probably would have been a lot more successful as it is though he plays the character completely serious at some moments and for laughs at others this doesn t work it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold you always know it s him and the movie is badly paced too it never takes off it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum i think the blame for this should be placed on the script it s obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist but once this is established the movie doesn t really go anywhere the formula of the film seems to be this billy crystal says no to deniro deniro forces him and much wackiness ensues this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie i ve said it before and i ll say it again the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it s funny if analyze this had been funny the pacing and bad acting wouldn t have bothered me i would have been too busy laughing to notice but as it is i only chuckled a few times the only really funny scene is a dead on parody of the godfather sadly though i don t think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody because i was the only one laughing but my sense of humour i have come to realize is vastly different from the general population i loathed there s something about mary yet loved baseketball now if you want a movie that i think is funny go out and see office space it s full of genuine laughs and won t leave you glancing at your watch every minutes as analyze this did 
you d think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games it hasn t worked so far street fighter super mario brothers wing commander mortal kombat not a watchable film in the bunch still i held out some hope for tomb raider after all the game s premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept however despite the potential of the project tomb raider proves to be yet another bomb the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies there s a once ever years alignment of planets coming up and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world of course the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world our heroine lady lara croft angelina jolie finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father jon voight dug up she figures that if she gets the triangle she can bring her dad back from the dead of course no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway in both video games and action movies the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences however the action in tomb raider shows little style or originality there s lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct to cable flick the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer the mummy returns was much better it had its flaws but its action was creative and large scale since winning her academy award for girl interrupted jolie hasn t taken any projects that would display her acting talents tomb raider seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts so much attention is drawn to them that it s a shame there s no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra while we don t see much of her acting ability with the exception of a wonderful upper crust british accent we do get a hint of jolie s less savory side considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father and uninterested in any of the living males around her seems a poor choice having jolie s real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier i haven t decided what to make of director simon west yet his first feature was the star studded disaster con air but my opinion of him improved with the general s daughter which was thick with sultry atmosphere now this train wreck i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series the prisoner hollywood has already screwed up the avengers and the prisoner represents a chance for redemption by the way speaking of british tv red dwarf fans should look for chris rimmer barrie in his first major film role 
 spice world is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls sure there s a hint of humor in there every once in a while actually there s a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls but overall who cares not me if you don t know by now the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood in spice world they ride around in their big tour bus whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews amazingly all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things things they want to do not things they are required to do to keep earning money and they keep babbling about girl power when they should really be talking about cleavage power i mean if all it takes is girl power then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits the film is pg but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions you d have yourself one raunchy adult film by the way there s something in the opening credits which says based on an idea by the spice girls wow they got idea credit i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood giving credit for simply having the thought say girls let s make a movie the supporting cast fares well roger moore the real james bond mockingly plays the cliche spewing chief of the spice girls and darn it all he s fun to watch mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band s manager richard e grant one question though george wendt you d think that spice world would envoke one of two reactions in people if you like the spice girls you ll like them even more afterwards and if you can t stand them like me then spice world will really make you sick oddly the audience i saw the film with roughly twelve year old girls sat in silence for the entire film well not the two who sat directly behind me they kept muttering this is stupid over and over again maybe there is hope for humanity after all pg 
the general s daughter is a heartless absurd film a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham handed obscenity creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo depth what s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess playing warrant officer paul brenner brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell leslie stefanson daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell brenner is teamed up with ex spouse sarah sunderland madeline stowe and they check out all the suspects on the base including elizabeth s mentor colonel moore james woods soon it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff but the question comes down to why and of course who ebert s law of the economy of characters can be applied here one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point including the two protagonists but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that but it s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something on a story level the general s daughter is ineptly constructed the film adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille s novel which was apparently based on a true story plods along to its conclusion filling in the blanks with stale unrealistic dialogue and shocking plot developments having not read the novel it s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity minutes after finding the dead young woman brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue which includes endless strings of forced lines sunderland actually asks brenner why was she killed to which i would have answered if i knew then the movie would already be over only after we ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together this angle though apparently present to develop their characters is never explored not that it really matters since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot in one scene sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask she sees one of his rings and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect they take him to brenner s houseboat beat him up and pour hot coffee in his lap this scene really pushed me over the edge not because it s gratuitous and mean spirited but because it illustrates the film s complete disregard for the characters and the audience it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise i realized that these constructs on screen aren t actually characters but devices present only to serve the story this would have been bad enough without the west s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct compelling films about sexual crimes don t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks and they certainly don t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture these scenes are not the least bit powerful on the contrary they re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain whomever that may turn out to be in addition the movie treats sexual fetishes and sadomasochism in particular as if it s a perversion of everything we know to be pure this standpoint is certainly allowed but only in accompaniment with well developed themes to back it up as it is the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane perhaps the only positive elements in the general s daughter are a couple of the performances james woods has a few terrific scenes and plays his role with sharp witty subtlety i also liked james cromwell mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous nonetheless these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization the general s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film it pretends to have a soul to be of strict moral code when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut outs force feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one sided moral judgments 
for his directoral debut gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects but while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writer director the audience is left in the dark the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars then he returns home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their five year old daughter raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valerie s brother billy charlie creed miles of stealing raymond then proceed to beat and bite him to a bloody wreck but these are the least of billy s problems billy is a heroin addict on the downturn and it doesn t seem that he ll last much longer billy and valerie s mother janet laila morse is raymond s nemesis she disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it she merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments if this description seems bleak i haven t told the half of it this is not a cheery movie and most of the time it s downright depressing while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end it s not quite worth it there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose take for example the extended sequence where one of billy s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy the film is filled with these character moments that never really achieve anything granted there are a few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the film but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us the actors do a fine job particularly in the central roles the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience oldman got it about half right 
if you re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional then this is the movie for you indeed this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip offs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them it s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film but at least we re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie first the movie gives us an introductory premise huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor and in this area many ships have disappeared oooh scary secondly a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score third the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo treat williams he operates a sophisticated military style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy finally in the cargo hold we see those that hired him they are also mercenaries that have tough looking haircuts talk with accents and try to show how macho they are during their trip across the stormy sea their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs spotting a cruise ship in the distance they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop take the parts that they need and then continue on their merry way little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster yet they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds this is nothing more than a by the book action film their realization of the situation that they re in doesn t happen until they are in the bowels of the boat those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed the corridors on the ship are narrow misty and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare fests must have yet despite the predictable nature of this film there are some scary boo moments but most of it is just outright silly and this film is unusually gory too monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive he screams horribly as the monster s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away additionally it borrows heavily from speed alien and a bunch of other recent films the mercenaries even run into a lone surviving passenger femke jannsen who looks amazingly like sandra bullock to be honest when i left the theatre i just had to laugh at how witless the film was it s moronic fun at best so if you re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness then this might just hit the spot 
a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent but one with no edge to it it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich s and stock characters of this genre though it s a well written and well acted fluff piece it still does not have too much to say that is surprising it s made for the gentle art house set those who don t want something too disturbing to think about it s about a critically successful writer husband alec pryce who is so self absorbed that he s threatened by his department store floor walking model wife kate bouquet who wants to be a writer she meets his crass publisher vanni corso walken another self absorbed man and a predictable relationship occurs the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband s first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet she now wants her own identity and her independence the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax it s set in london and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper vanni she later meets him as her hubby s new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel alec who is an obnoxious grouse someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni the publisher is proud that he s a mamma s boy who never married and is a self made man who has earned millions he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it as he proudly tells kate if my father could sell pizzas in harlem i could sell culture in europe the only thing that couldn t be sold is this stiff story and tired plot line the mystery to me is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon to become beleaguered vanni when she writes a second novel he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper a business affair was loosely based on the real life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly in their celebrated s love triangle 
georges polti once wrote a paper called the thirty six dramatic situations in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty six different situations this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes there s nothing new under the sun the faculty the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion there s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers screenwriter kevin williamson of scream credit gives us a horror tale set in middle america ohio one eventful fall making use of a cast of unusually stock characters williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day style but rather through the back door parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run down high school and soon have infested most of the student body leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day the lack of gusto is the movie s major stumbling block even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this they ve been saved by an energetic approach this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson s ability who enjoyed success with the wes craven directed scream but couldn t pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer although he designs the faculty with more of a sci fi bent than his typical slasher picture it still comes down to the same results throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive on that level the main roles are played by virtual unknowns only the recognizeable elijah wood deep impact is at the front other than that the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up and comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved but to do that they d all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la dawson s creek needless to say the acting is far from top notch nor does necessity ask that it should be there is a moment or two of genuine horror but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci fi direction to make any use of it in sum the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off 
for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality trois is surprisingly tame despite it s lurid subject matter and it s passing nod to fatal attraction it moves along with flat uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film freshly moved to atlanta jermaine dourdan and his wife jasmine moore have the trappings of a perfect life they have a beautiful house in suburbia jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm jasmine is his supportive wife who is finishing up her college degree in an opening montage via a home video of the pair we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs this is a couple that has it all into this eden slithers the lure of lust despite his outward appearance jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business oblivious to jasmine s concerns we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage a trois much to jasmine s dismay as jermaine puts it don t you want to be sexually free jermaine shares his desire with co worker terrence smith who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter the woman jade palmer is a direct counterpoint to jasmine jade at one point was a college student too unlike jasmine she found herself pregnant dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet to further reinforce their differences it s revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son inevitably through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine s part the forbidden act is consummated the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine s property with the hint that the violence may escalate by this point trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama a fatal attraction without the social significance the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical jermaine comes off as insincere sexually driven and selfish jasmine is bland and subservient jade comes off a bit sympathetically but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy yet another tale of a sexually aggressive dog of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating innocent mate the last minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve but by this point will you even care if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending perhaps there could have been some freshness to it as it stands trois is pretty standard fare 
once upon a time jean claude van damme was a decent action hero the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films boasting his spectacular martial arts ability some of these excursions were fun but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind numbing action and when the action goes sour what is there left to enjoy i ll explain knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong marcus ray van damme a babe magnet and stylish dresser heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner rob schneider they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans seemingly by a mole in the business i m going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph so if you want a review devoid of spoilers skip onto the next one i m not quite sure who gives a crap but i ll issue a warning anyhow tommy is really working with the cia his boss a very hammy and flat paul sorvino is the mole and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons he even stoops so low to put them into children s toys if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing then you probably will enjoy knock off if you think that this ridiculous set up couldn t even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing this might not be your cup of tea knock off sucks it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something simply because van damme is the star the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe director tsui hark who teamed with van damme in the superior but still lame brained double team is at the helm and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence speeds are altered consistently and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired it all sounds very cool trust me it isn t as much as it scars me to say this har har van damme is terrible sure he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease he looks like he s doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan and his performance is stiff and tired i hate to say it but perhaps it s time for mr van damme to give up his day job it s really a test of endurance watching knock off i suppose there s some enjoyment derived from schneider s character who is extremely annoying but provides the film s better moments and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter knock off doesn t even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film like a handful of van damme s others no this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department that is certainly not saying much note to self avoid universal soldier the return upon release in august 
the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment with she s all that and varsity blues behind us and several more set for release later in the year the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance however you wouldn t know it from the quality of the latest entry jawbreaker this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center the most popular and most feared clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma they have accidentally killed one of their own the teen dream liz purr charlotte roldan choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her th birthday now the three surviving girls must decide what to do it takes little time at all for the group s leader courtney rose mcgowan to decide to cover it up the ditzy marcie julie benz is game to go along but the clique s final member julie rebecca gayheart has a guilty conscience to make things worse another student the hopelessly geeky fern mayo judy evans greer accidentally discovers the truth the girls cover is surely blown not so fast thinking quickly courtney offers fern a once in a lifetime chance after a quick makeover fern is transformed into vylette the beautiful new girl at school and a full fledged member of the popular crowd does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder or will this finely honed plan crack over time jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation and failing miserably i might add it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations but misses three crucial elements sharp dialogue witty characters and the much needed humor it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being darkly humorous if it wasn t shackled to its dead weight plot the film s most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo at this point jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths but then all of a sudden the innovation stops the film becomes mired in the murder and cover up plotting which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film in the film rose mcgowan fares the best as the manipulative clique leader she truly dominates every scene she s in not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this however it s a character crying out for a better movie or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact jawbreaker doesn t quite know how to handle its semi likable characters fern and julie either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters as their motives become murky and unclear the film finally falls to the point that it doesn t really matter who wins or loses since all sides have become equally detestable detestable is a good word to describe the film jawbreaker it s certain that like the murder weapon described in the film s title jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience 
a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city the lawyer kevin lomax keanu reeves is not offered a job yet he is asked to simply pick a jury he accepts the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money but a gorgeous apartment he convinces his wife mary ann charlize theron to make the move to new york the first case given to him is a big test a winless case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal his new boss and partner in the firm john milton al pacino is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing explaining many of his philosophies on law women and sex and angles the promise of a blissful wealthy life kevin s next case is a dream case given to him by milton himself much to the chagrin to his colleagues defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law although kevin s career is taking off his home life is not doing very well mary ann is starting to have numerous problems she is experiencing severe depression over kevin s long hours and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls their faces becoming horribly disfigured kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with then focus all of his attention on his wife not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer connie nielson also working with the firm mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife and gets disturbing news from his mother judith ivey about the mystery concerning the identity of his father he also starts to lose control of his case kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man that man is his boss mr milton a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store but how do you defeat the devil why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd do filmmakers really believe that normal courtroom drama doesn t fit the bill and they have to juice them up the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom which wouldn t have been too bad if it weren t keanu reeves trying to pull it off i give reeves credit for trying hard but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short charlize theron defines the term over the top in her performance as mary ann lomax a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in days in the valley the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil and you can tell he is having fun doing so but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him it s pretty standard stuff including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled but i have to get something off of my chest in i remember watching a movie called wisdom with emilio estevez and demi moore and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do what i like to call guess what it was all a dream scenario in wisdom the two lead characters are killed at the end only to have one of the characters wake up from an apparent and say gosh i m glad that didn t really happen i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with well the same thing happens in the devils advocate and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan since it failed and he is the devil but the point is that the last of the film didn t happen i know it s a stretch after all it is a movie and nothing really happened but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that of course the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one as i recall wisdom was a decent film the devil s advocate is not the devils advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton al pacino kevin lomax keanu reeves mary ann lomax charlize theron mrs lomax judith ivey eddie barzoon jeffrey jones christabella connie nielson written by randy turgeon march 
susan granger s review of mulholland drive universal focus whatever david lynch is selling i m not buying from the writer director of blue velvet and twin peaks comes another dark mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills dazed a beautiful brunette laura elena harring emerges and stumbles down a hill slipping unobserved into a s style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip the next morning a dewy blonde naomi watts from deep river ontario arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust meanwhile a hotshot director justin theroux whose wife is in bed with the poolman is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there s an assassin mark pellegrino roaming the city the tortuous paths of these various characters and others named cookie coco and cowboy intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because midway through the story lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality leaving a huge wad of cash a blue metallic key a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses effectively making the subtle switch the same cannot be said for former m g m dancer ann miller who s stiff and self conscious speaking like most lynch players in staccato tones on the granger movie gauge of to mulholland drive is a frenzied frustrating originally designed as an episodic tv pilot this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out 
its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated yet trys a bit too hard with the voices of woody allen gene hackman jennifer lopez sylvester stallone and sharon stone this computer animated yak fest think toy story filled with used merchandising is one for the ant eaters the main story is the independence of a worker named z allen he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony when he finds out about insectopia a mythical place where all insects can run free z along with his colony s princess stone journey out into the world to find a meaning for life about minutes into the picture i began to wonder what the point of the film was halfway through i still didn t have an answer by the end credits i just gave up and ran out antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice overs allen is nonchalant while i would have guessed if i hadn t seen her in the mighty and basic instinct stone can t act even in a cartoon this film is one for the bugs unfunny and extremely dull hey a bug s life may have a good time doing antz in 
often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into the call of the oboe o toque do oboe is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray many elements of the film are solid and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know but they simply don t convert into a solid work although a setting is never established it becomes apparent the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day the community is a dull one where every day is a downhill slide from the last over time the people have taken to themselves the town cinema is closed no tourist has passed through in years and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger so what happens when a tourist paolo betti does arrive one day he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner leticia vota who also happens to be engaged to the town s police inspector a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance s involvement with this musician the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray it features a character who literally rises from his grave a woman who has a phone conversation with god and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character to an almost humorous drunk technically this film is a nightmare the music score is poorly edited into the film so it is often choppy rough and abrupt the lighting is poor at best which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue but the subtitles are limited to fewer than words in addition the pace of the film seems uneven it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one s patience the film then moves into a faster pace that again slows towards the end as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark there was however potential for this film it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music and the re unification of people these are all topics that could easily fill a movie perhaps if there were no freak show and the technical aspects were to improve there might just be a thing of beauty at the end most importantly though the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren t such a bore until then there seems to be little more hope for this piece than that boy has by simply crying out mommy while he wanders astray in a park 
the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence it s not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it doesn t make a shred of sense and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film james foley knows a lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train at least we have chow yun fat in the lead role chow plays nick chen a chinatown cop he s a good cop as the first few scenes establish and he s very familiar with chinatown that s probably why the powers that be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg nick and danny begin by stepping on each other s toes but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one s life what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me i m fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann i m also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ric young a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff i m not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny although this makes for some ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along the way there s also an interesting subplot revolving around danny s father brian cox but it doesn t have much to do with the main story one of the problems as i said is that the movie doesn t make any sense i don t blame this entirely on foley because he s obviously a good director i m more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci s script which doesn t seem to be in tune to the way normal people act one scene early on had me particularly annoyed nick confronts his boss because he s angry about his new white partner he s shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me in addition the film takes a bite into race related issues and never develops them at all there are a lot of scenes like this one and none of them are very coherent there s also a considerable language barrier given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents the plot itself never straightens out i m not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are or why henry lee is associated with them or what they do as a group the corruptor is an action movie and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences the sequences aren t bad but they re not new how many car chases through chinatown have you seen on that note how many chinatown cop movies have you seen one too many i d imagine foley s strength is clearly in characterization and he does a pretty good job here the scenes between nick and danny are very good and i actually got a feel for their characters a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together chow and wahlberg are both good actors chow is a pro and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere but he s still fun to watch i also liked the subplot involving danny s father brian cox s performance is powerful and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny but the film ultimately fails mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly familiar action scenes a complicated plot can be successful but the story needs to make sense when it s over the corruptor never manages to make any sense it just keeps spinning out of control until finally there s nothing left to hold on to 
 the red violin is a cold sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached it s a movie that seems almost clinical as it traces the plus years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title opening in the th century the story shows how violin maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son but when tragedy strikes the violin becomes the personification of its maker s grief from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery again tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao s communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz samuel l jackson who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity the violin becomes morritz s obsession just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it morritz however is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator s intention the red violin could have been a touching inspirational story as soaring as a beethoven symphony however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact girard for some unknown reason uses mostly master shots keeping his camera and thus us at a distance we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin it s resonance its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression nor are any of the performances memorable it s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin the red violin promises much but delivers little it is dull at times a bit pretentious and a might murky the movie s music soars over its story and performers and that is its only saving grace 
hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films in a nutshell the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership a lot of hong kong s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u s productions such talents as jackie chan rush hour chow yun fat anna the king the corrupter and yuen woo ping the matrix have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai unfortunately romeo must die bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong s rhythms the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing russell wong kai confronts po sing jon kit lee the son of kai s boss and leader of the local chinese family a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai who handily kicks and punches his opponents down it s not until club owner silk rapper dmx bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends the following morning po sing is found dead suspicions escalate as issac o day delroy lindo is told of the murder his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture issac implores his chief of security mac issiah washington to watch after his son and daughter the scene shifts to a prison in china where han sing jet li learns of his brothers murder he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined hung upside down by one foot han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work escaping to the u s han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother s death romeo must die is in many ways a fun film it is both absurd and assured the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes the godfather the relationship between jet li s han and aaliyah s trish o day reminds us of abel ferrera s china girl except that romeo must die s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable li of course has the showiest part having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination allayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace it s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic but still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it delro lindo as issac o day carries himself well in the film an unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turns out the films best performance the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d b woodside as issac s son colin the performance is undirected with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and or better written first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film having a career as one of the industry s best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots and romeo must die does look good but the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah s bodyguard maurice has no comic timing whatsoever the best things about the film are its fight scenes jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles one needs only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat here jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that lethal weapon jet s u s debut didn t allow unfortunately a lot of jet s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision also romeo must die must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an x ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent obviously a homage to the famed x ray scene from sonny chiba s streetfighter the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film it s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted one problem though about the fight scenes those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon they do have an internal rhythm to them a heartbeat so to speak in their choreography the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance this is created by the performance the direction and the editing here in romeo must die there is no staccato every fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern the rhythm is monotonous a hong kong film has a tempo that changes heightening its emotional impact rmd is limited to a standard tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan s films watch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help now look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx there you have a heartbeat and emotional draw that doesn t let the audience catch its breath the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted here in romeo must die the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl jet li is a grand and personable screen presence it s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here one day filmmakers here in the u s will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity until then we ll be left with emotionally hollow product like the replacement killer and currently romeo must die 
first troy beyer wrote the critically panned b a p s now she makes her directorial debut writing directing and starring in this sub par film about women talking about sex though not without redeeming qualities this film is bad the basic story follows three single friends jazz beyer lena randi ingerman and michelle paget brewster in their search for love jazz has an idea for a local talk show it would feature women talking about sex and dating she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film there are several moments of bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension in a low budget independent film from a first time director these faults can sometimes be forgiven if the screenplay is fresh and solid that is not the case here the script suffers from random plot developments there are four or five of these turns in the plot each one raising the question where did that come from at one point a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother we are supposed to be moved but since the scene is completely un led up to we really don t care if she and her mother get along we ve never seen her mother before we never see her again who cares what s worse these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy at another point a character announces that she can t have children apparently this is devastating we wouldn t know this because she never talked about having kids before but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her the scene feels like an afterthought its emotion manipulative and shallow these scenes grow worse and worse culminating in an absurd climax two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing one scene is a lover s spat between two minor characters the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax thinking on these scenes it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities but it does first it is original we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea it s something i don t think has been the subject of a film second the interviews of the miami women are sincere taken together they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes but each tile is some woman s real experience neither the picture of women nor their picture of men is truly representative but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way at some level the stereotypes that emerge can be called true i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their likes dislikes skills and thrills but on the whole it s pretty bad and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting corny dialogue and emotional overextension i ll give beyer one more strike and then she s out rated r almost got an nc for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity 
i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws but if you ask me the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american or more the point anyone that allows him to bask in his own less than subtle presence this is not an insult to gere as i consider him to be a rather talented actor but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role if a film is solely about one person the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work although gere s performance is in no way poorly acted it is far from perfect and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself this is where he truly belongs and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear with the sensational edward norton the jackal with bruce willis and pretty woman with the delightful julia roberts in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear bold and up front who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail it doesn t take long from the film s beginning for jack moore s charm to work on a pretty chinese lady and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room drunk and cheerful yet instead of a hangover poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison his cell food and rights all terrible now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy lawyer shen yuelin bai ling defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder jack and shen argue about their countries different laws shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family as the plot thickens scenes get progressively more ridiculous ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but you knew along criminal is discovered red corner is one of those films where you sneer laugh or vomit you re way through all of its minutes what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act this is not to say that the film does not have its moments there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly the basic idea is quite tangible it is upon the film s execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate the evidence that goes missing the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before if that wasn t bad enough red corner s dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself taking itself far too seriously red corner is not half the film it intends to be although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast the film s main fault is in the bizarre and often out of place way of unfolding a story which isn t that meritorious anyway whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again martin vail where are you

if you ve been following william fichtner s career and there s absolutely no reason why you should have you might have noticed that he s played some rather similar roles over the years like sully in the perfect storm tough gruff and a little bit scary or law in albino alligator tough gruff and little bit scarier or colonel william sharp in armageddon or dwayne engelman in strange days or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of pearl harbor as the abusive father of danny here is an actor who gravitates towards tough gruff hard hitting roles which is why his performance in what s the worst that could happen is such a shock such a delight in the film fichtner plays a blonde haired meticulously dressed overtly effeminate dog loving detective as alex tardio fichtner s performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it it borders on offensive but doesn t really manage it and it borders on clich d stereotype but doesn t quite succumb to that definition either in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming fichtner isn t perfect you can see him struggling a little at times concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal but he s pretty damned good and silly and without question the best thing in the film in fact had it not been for fitchner s sudden and bizarre appearance and his jarring screen presence thereafter i would have walked out for what s the worst that could happen is mesmerizing in its awfulness a poorly written haphazardly edited and totally unfunny yes it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible moviegoing experience fichtner s performance doesn t exactly save the film and it s not like i m recommending what s the worst that could happen solely on the strength of the actor s dramatic turnaround but his contributions do raise the film s rating from no stars to one and a half thumbs up to fichtner then and thumbs down way way down to everyone else involved in this sorry mess a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn t even warrant discussion 
this review contains spoilers but believe me i don t say anything you can t guess minutes into the movie i did go into this one with high expectations i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film boy was i wrong another garbage slasher flick the only difference being that this one has a story the story you ask well a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk he takes it home somehow getting it past customs and starts fiddling with it in his attic lo and behold after he takes it apart three demons appear and start taking him apart but with meat hooks when they re finished his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling they botch up their cleanup job however and manage to leave his heart or some gland i didn t really recognize the organ under a floorboard the guy s brother and his brother s wife appear at the door soon after and decide to move in they throw away scumball s belongings and set up house turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage she starts having some wild hallucinations later hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards slow mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground all from the tiny cut on his hand said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball s organ the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing it establishes mind contact with wife who agrees to help him get more blood because she really wants to be screwed again so she helps him kill three businessmen scumball at this time gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back problem is he doesn t have any skin and even after three or four corpses still doesn t get any skin he finally gets some though but strangely enough he ends up looking like his brother guess they couldn t get the original actor back who knows scumball whose name is frank is not a nice guy he describes his torture by the demons fondly as the ultimate pleasure and pain since at that level there is no difference between the two somehow i don t see getting torn apart by fish and meat hooks a lot of fun this guy is so bad how bad is he so bad that the rats cower in a corner in fear for good reason too he crucifies two of them for fun and carves a third while the nympho s horsing around with hubby anyway hubby s daughter who if course is not wife s daughter starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams the dumb bimbo meets scumball and is not impressed she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle and brings out the demons at any rate the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup they re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake the demons are not however the good guys the dumb bimbo s the good guy she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank but also banishes them to hell or oblivion we re not too sure which not too shabby for someone with single digit iq this is basically a bad jinn story it is an awful movie awful acting bad focus in the photography many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks which is really unrealistic and looks like the latex that it is continuity who cares acting terrible script horrible sounds canned unrealistic story is so so but the impact is lost long long before the film ends i do think the rat acting was quite good i have never seen rats look afraid they should get nominated for an award really good acting there the best in the movie the envelope for best furry rodent please a rating would be far too generous a rating or in the to rating system is far more accurate this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen had to have something to do dumb dumb dumb movie i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself lots of slime and red dyed corn syrup does not constitute horror in my opinion 
you don t need to have seen the original species to appreciate how utterly lousy species ii is with few exceptions sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them but the fact that species ii is a follow up isn t the only reason it s so miserable it s the predictable storyline the cardboard characters the banal dialogue the failed attempts at humor the revolting special effects the gratuitous nudity all female of course the bad acting and the bland direction the plot simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle the slime well sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black that should have been the end of the movie right there back on terra firma at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and as you ll remember if you saw the first movie driven by a strong urge to procreate on a parallel track government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film now called eve again played by natasha henstridge and are keeping her around for some testing this apparently includes observing eve s reaction to the dukes of hazzard tv show which she appears to enjoy eve s bio rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk mates which we are forced to witness in gross out detail but otherwise there doesn t appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film unless it was written into her contract let s hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only eve finally breaks free of her confines and her bra for the finale but the effects are so messy you can t really see what s going on peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams i told em not to go at the top of his lungs referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox so that he can enter high security areas flash a badge and claim to be press maybe as does marg helgenberger as dr laura baker the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns they re both unbelievably wooden what s a talented filmmaker like peter medak the ruling class the krays let him have it doing directing this tripe i wonder it s an unfortunate trend this once talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like species ii last year peter hyams gave us the relic no thanks necessary there and the first species was helmed by roger donaldson who although certainly no genius behind the camera had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects is it just that there are no better offers out there species ii is worthless worse than that it s also exploitative offensive and insulting to the intelligence at every turn it s not that there isn t anything positive to say about the film there is after minutes it ends 
there s a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book screenwriting made easy this is funny the first time just cause it is but funnier as the film goes on since it s totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it outlined it and then wrote this film it s like they took the sub genre of the disaster pic which can be fun and hokey at the same time and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them the stupid eccentric characters yes the poseidon adventure is crap but it s fun cause of all the stupid eccentric characters and earthquake my god earthquake has got to be one of the worst movies of all time but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold volcano takes a semi intriguing yet stupendously inane plot a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops only it s in dare i say it l a and then puts no stupid stereotypical eccentric characters in it they re just stupid and the actors are all good ones tommy lee jones is great an oscar winner and a member of the men in black my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer anne heche is a good indy actress don cheadle stole the disappointing devil in a blue dress from denzel s feet and gaby s one of the few good teenage actors but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what s going on they do their best god bless them but they re all lost in the fake magma only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he s the greatest part of the film there s no real suspense here cause you don t care about anyone i actually was rooting for gaby s character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn t have to keep saving her he did it like thirty times and there are no interesting sites in l a that we see get destroyed part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever in independence day the best part other than judd hirsch was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens that was cool watching really fake looking magma plow down the street is not okay so the film s not devoid of merit as i already stated don cheadle was great and the cast does their best and there s this really moronic scene which looks cool john carrol lynch norm from fargo goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it he has one guy who s wounded and could make it he could throw the guy and jump and still survive but no he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava here s the cool sight he melts here s the dumb part of it he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting cool sight no logic but cool sight the volcano erupts twice and for some reason the film ends there they aren t worried about it eruting again they just go home to their toppled homes but to tell the truth i was glad they didn t go on i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended my god it was actually painful to sit through this little minute long film i haven t seen dante s peak but i ve heard it s a masterpiece compared to this if you want to see a cool disaster flick that s inane but interesting rent the towering inferno with steve mcqueen paul newman and the schweppervescent o j simpson he saves a cat if you want to waste your time watching a boring stupid disaster flick literally it almost grossed half of its budget see this but i warned you 
an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis feature an american werewolf in london where the original had comedy the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit coms where the first installment had chills this one has sequences that are inappropriately unintentionally funny in short while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans andy tom everett scott brad vince vieluf and chris phil buckman sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping soon they have company in the person of serafine julie delpy who has decided to end it all she jumps but andy with a bungee cord attached goes after her and manages to save her at the price of a major headache serafine disappears but a smitten andy seeks her out however once he learns his would be girlfriend s dark secret he wishes he hadn t she s a werewolf cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full and to make matters worse he has suffered a nasty bite himself actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie she imbues serafine with spirit spunk and humanity which gives us an emotional stake in the character s fate this isn t necessarily a good thing since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless campy entertainment experience delpy s injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her delpy s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski s white and richard linklater s before sunrise she was radiant charismatic and effective in both given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here she gets as close as possible to those adjectives it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy which is to say they give performances appropriate for the screenplay tom everett scott that thing you do plays the lead like he s in a made for tv movie it would be kind to call him bland actors vince vieluf and phil buckman as andy s friends are no more impressive julie bowen happy gilmore is suitably fetching as werewolf meat and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal on the technical side it s all bad news the computer generated werewolves look painfully unreal the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits repeated use is made of the werewolf cam an infrared wolf s point of view approach that s interesting the first couple of times it s employed then becomes tedious and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on screen action they re matched to director anthony waller who displayed a confident edgy style in mute witness stumbles with this material never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel as a result we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii your sister is a werewolf i will give waller credit for killing off a dog though something that s rarely seen in movies these days an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a bad movie sort of way but that s a dubious distinction ultimately it s an unfortunate effort for while it isn t unbearable to sit through it isn t a howl either 
vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow james woods is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out while the initial imagery is a little over dramatic it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence that is enough action to last us a while and we could director john carpenter would let us get to a story line but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end and that is something of a pity because the film based on the book vampire by john steakley gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans this has not always been carpenter s style his version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film s central science fictional question jack crow heads a vampire swat team cleaning up nests of vampires with high tech spears and crossbows in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek thomas ian griffith who has been tipped off to who crow is now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya daniel baldwin to make matters worse he does not know the people on his own side tony and his backers he can trust meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions that s exactly what it is the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film show people don t tell them just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding why are the vampires in new mexico what do they want and why do they want it what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized but instead are revealed through dialog now if all this was not bad enough carpenter misuses the james wood persona woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio leone style mythic posturing while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero that is not his style and it just does not work very well there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret these vampires do not maintain a low profile there are arguably logical flaws in the film there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a on the to scale and a on the to scale perhaps i will read the book 
capsule an insult a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn t even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it s not simply idiotic it s contemptuous of its audience it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely it s a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here it s not even fun as trash woody and wesley star maybe that s not the right word as new york city transit authority police they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain snatchers and the other does lookout i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this raised by a documentary i d seen on the subject once but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought provoking see if you can follow this they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the money train the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books is parked the guards on the train see this kid running at them lift their machine guns shout halt and then open fire when the kid doesn t stop running at them blam the kid s dead then woody and wesley show up and of course the other ta cops hate them why and a pushing match starts and someone gets decked and i covered my face i d seen enough i ve never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy systematically any chance of being credible or interesting fed up with the bs at their job most of it their own goddamned fault woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train hence the title in case some of you all two of you didn t figure it out yet then there s this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks and a love story and a holdup no two holdups sorry easy to lose track in a movie this braindead and a mob boss who wants his money there wasn t a minute when i gave a horse s ass about any of it neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute we do not care about them they are not interesting they are noisy loud stupid foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy they deserve to get shot or run over as the case may be they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was written into a movie like white men can t jump and which simply does not exist here they are idiots and we re expected to root for them bullcrap the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture what exactly is this mess a cop movie police procedure is not given a moment s genuine thought anywhere a thriller the subplot with the token booth killer is inept a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite a comedy the few jokes that do work are wasted a drama all dramatic tension between both principals is freeze dried and off the rack there s not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk it s all screenwriterese that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four letter words actual dialogue excerpt fuck you what you heard me fuck you no fuck you look i ll be honest here i ve tried writing screenplays and even i suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess i d get laughed out of the office anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch because god knows i know i can do better i ve weasted enough time on this piece of tripe 
 tina fetch me the axe a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands it wasn t just the film s disappointing box office performance indeed in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two three even six times no the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming mommie dearest the biggest mommie of them all executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn but it was all too late mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history unfortunately faye dunaway s energetic at times ridiculously over the top performance is about the film s only redeeming feature based on daughter christina crawford s trashy biography mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother if you believe this movie it was a life was racked by obsession lonliness child abuse and rampant egomania the film begins with crawford adopting two children and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother s will joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves you see but that s about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film s end the script laboured over by four writers a bad sign in itself is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum frank perry s direction is no more than competent and dunaway s bitchy lines aside the dialogue is flat and uninvolving in fairness the film s second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling joan visits and keeps in touch not helping her financially but encouraging christina s own acting and career ambitions crawford does seem to care about her daughter but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers ah but there is dunaway s performance and what a delicious piece of campery it often is having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she s making spotting a young tree she doesn t like the look of she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line tina fetch me the axe with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling in the film s most outrageous scene joan realises that some of her daughter s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers oh dear sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum doesn t it this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst no wire hangers ever and later when the board of her late husband s company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring don t fuck with me fellas oh joy something of a camp classic then but if that s not you re cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn t have too much to recommend it better you see the real crawford in the women mildred pierce or whatever happened to baby jane great films distinguished by great performances and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry s shrieking piece of tabloid froth 
 battlefield earth is the best comedy of the year it has to be the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider bad movie syndrome struck me again so after witnessing how much battlefield earth has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first hand is it as bad as advertised oh yes very much so the plot is incomprehensible the acting is atrocious the special effects are mediocre the action is dull the implausibilities are legion the dialogue is cringe inducing the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny i don t even want to continue reviewing this movie i d like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory so here it is the premise is basically a rip off of planet of the apes only minus the apes and philosophical discussion and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo the year is the psychlos have conquered earth and the human population has been enslaved only a handful of humans escaped to radiation rich areas to escape the aliens they live out their lives in fear one man johnny goodboy i know i know tyler barry pepper ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos there he confronts the psychlo head of security a big ugly klingon looking creature called terl john travolta pressed into slavery johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back meanwhile terl is faced with his own problems he has recently learned that he s stuck living on earth which he hates for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man s daughter he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology this is where the plot gets ridiculous so the man animal can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can t go terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself of course his plan doesn t work so many things wrong with this movie where to begin how about with travolta whose hollywood clout brought about this the cinematic version of scientology guru l ron hubbard s sci fi novel early previews for battlefield earth with constant shots of a makeup laden travolta cackling like lex luthor had me and several audience members remarking what the hell is travolta thinking the movie did nothing to stem such remarks all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here terl cackles after nearly every line and so does every other psychlo of course this makes every scene hilariously overwrought no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america but ceos generally don t laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees you were going to be promoted but now you re not fwahahahahahahahaha it s no big surprise terl loses to the humans he s an idiot he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book he underestimates his enemies assuming he ll win just because he s smarter he uses the word leverage like some sort of scientologist mantra not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him no wonder this guy never got his promotion the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for years and how do all these previously brain dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly there s a whole lot more to scratch one s head about in battlefield earth bring a scorecard to track the plot holes director roger christian shoots battlefield earth in the most distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason all the characters appear to be standing on the walls and it s awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue the action sequences are atrociously edited every one turned into an endless slow motion parade that drains all potential excitement are these things really so hard to construct my respect for supposed lightweight action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in battlefield earth how badly an action sequence can be shot this movie is an absolute headache it s not just the shot selection and editing the movie quite frankly makes no sense for most of battlefield earth s running time i just didn t know what was happening it didn t have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical though they certainly are i really had no idea what the hell was going on when i pieced the plot together later it didn t look any better here s how much of a disaster this is battlefield earth is already the worst movie of the year and it s going to take something really really inept to top it the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it in fact i d think that hubbard s cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible that ll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again 
 the skulls is a laughably bad thriller a teen orientated doppelganger of the firm so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter i chuckled incessantly all the way home let me share the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale designed i m sure to mirror the actual skull bones from the same college luke mcnamara joshua jackson a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlights the latest skull scouting report despite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization soon after he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women driving a new car and marveling at the that somehow surfaced in his bank account yeah dude pretty good deal eh but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstances become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe as a drooling vegetable the premise although lacking in originality certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense unfortunately the skulls is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting it s just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack the stars but not the script the skulls is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers first off upon their initiation into the skulls each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar will they never take this watch off and what if they forget it by their bedside perhaps their secret society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed on top of this they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters gee why not member t shirts but my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual agree or disagree notions when making collective decisions they are given official skull paddles when flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal facing the opposite way means a disagreement wouldn t they merely express themselves verbally hell no they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote and maybe afterward they can play ping pong i m still chuckling about these ludicrous details but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest the cast meanwhile combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the dawson s creek crowd and fuses the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout but not entirely accomplished actors like craig t nelson as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson as fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricatures and look suitably embarrassed handling them and then there s christopher mcdonald who has the capacity to be a fun exciting actor mcdonald s charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue makes it a hat trick i pray it was a snatch the paycheck and run exercise for all these actors the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better let s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character paul walker the strapping quarterback from varsity blues is bland but passable as caleb mandrake the judge s son walker preserves a straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie dad i just killed a guy in the ritual room some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who plays luke s longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one or maybe not minute one thanks to a decent set up from director rob cohen who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style it makes you wonder why he didn t flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller daylight aren t superior cinema they belong on the afi top list when compared to this degrading trash aside from unintentionally humoring the audience the skulls gets little accomplished the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical the story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage we ve seen it all before and better the skulls is a feeble little circus of stupidity so miscalculated that while it would serve as a clever pun a term like boneheaded seems just too generous 
 the following review contains spoilers please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie chuck dowling the jacksonville film journal i wrote the above sentence in my review for s batman and robin apparently no one heard my words oh how i wish you had heard them oh how i wish someone had stopped him because he s done it again the plot of mm is similar to the paul schrader film hardcore a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale in fact it was everything that mm is not in the opening minutes of mm we see private detective tom welles nicolas cage working on a case for a prestigious member of the u s government keep this fact in mind cage is trusted with an important case which he solves he returns home to his wife and new daughter and even finds time to rake his yard keep that in mind too it s important as well he s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery after her husband s death she comes across a film in his private safe it appears to be snuff film a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film the main problem with mm is that the whole film is completely pointless welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman s lawyer anthony heald an actor who always plays the same type of character that being a bad guy when you first see him your first instinct is that he s behind the whole thing the choice of casting does the film in then as welles begins his investigation at times we will see a shadowy figure following him the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer or someone sent by the lawyer because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet so your first instinct has now been confirmed then when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced in one of those ridiculous since we re going to kill you anyway why not tell you the whole thing moments but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended huh also when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing his main goal is to get the film back so why did he give it up in the first place the lawyer had the film the whole time then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film it s totally absurd and this is the screenwriter of seven late in the film there s a confrontation between all the main characters and after a struggle one of the character s guns ends up underneath a car cage who has been handcuffed to a bed is rapidly trying to get to his gun which is on a table james gandolfini s character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of suspense you see the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he s trying to reach it from and so instead of going around the car to the other side where he can easily reach it he just keeps stretching go around to the other side of the car this goes on for minutes then after cage gets his gun gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car boy schumacher is really really getting on my nerves i think the final straw would be when cage returns home devastated by everything that he s seen on this case and then is no longer able to rake his lawn we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard other things that bugged me about mm one would be the music if you can call it that whenever the score starts up it sounds like techno music and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it awful decision there joel another is cage s performance at this point he s capable of a wide range of performances either good or bad for mm he delivers a very wooden one and only shines when he s interacting with joaquin phoenix who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case you re capable of much better mr cage now as for you mr schumacher i m starting to doubt if you re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema r

a big busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch the great white hype stars samuel l jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay per view revenues is to invent a white contender peter berg to challenge his black heavyweight champ damon wayans the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs white than black vs black he may be right in an absurdly accurate way but the film doesn t give us a reason to care as a scathing sports spoof hype is just that unfunny unfocused and at times just plain pointless as a commentary on race relations it s even less effective the dialogue is the best of this mess lines like jon lovitz exclaiming i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang though we never hear enough of it the script isn t strong enough though to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin house party he comes across as absolute overkill the great white hype almost turns around at the end at the big match when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock concert proportions with costumed dwarfs gangsta rappers and the champ dressed as death only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should ve been 
one of the first films of is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek the star of the wb s runaway hit dawson s creek following in the foot steps of mtv s two other live action films joe s apartment and dead man on campus varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace set in west cannan texas the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john mox moxon van der beek we know he s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook coach bud kilmer jon voight has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him the star quarterback lance harbor paul walker is a handsome blonde hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader darcy ali larter also on the team are an enormous guy ron lester with some health problems and the token african american team member eliel swinton whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin when lance is seriously injured mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend jules amy smart is threatened and there s a big game at the end guess who wins nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love there s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes also the role isn t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character he s still a pseudo intellectual whiny nice guy except here he also happens to be a jock voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don t fare much better on the positive side walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville scott son of james caan has some lively moments as tweeder the team s wild man larter as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas gets to show off the film s most interesting costumes including a very eye opening whipped cream bikini it s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r rating with a lot of harsh language alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson s creek presumably the target audience for the picture director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger from nickelodeon films a sister company of mtv and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out there s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul foo fighters green day and aaliyah but it s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film 
toward the bottom of the s action movie barrel lies action jackson the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes this carl apollo creed weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs evil establishment crook and relies on all the s trappings from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs weathers is action jackson a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques speaking of one past criminal apprehension jackson s superior yells you tore his arm off jackson replies he had a spare jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane craig t nelson and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson after hearing what jackson thinks of him stone says i take it you re not one of dellaplane s friends not unless they changed the definition jackson glowers and of course it turns out stone is mrs dellaplane faux pas jackson not everything is happy in motown people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa it s all up to jackson to stop it and his only lead lies in vanity not his own wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane s nightclub after singing one particularly sultry number for him she saunters over and complains i expected a standing ovation he responds you re getting one and it s damn clever because he s sitting down at the time prince wouldn t even let out an innuendo that lame and he s the king of the horndogs or at least the prince it s a testament to the s that sharon stone is killed off within the first minutes but vanity survives the whole movie action jackson is another variation on the unlikely partners buddy action flick with jackson lugging junkie vanity around this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade and with the dialogue they re given there s not much room for improvement my favorite is when vanity feeling the effects of drug withdrawal says i feel like my teeth are hollow my gums are made of dry rubber and someone s trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head jackson s response is i think i felt that way once they called it love you ll understand when i say watch this at your own risk serving the world for nearly th of a century 
 american pie alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer s attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple ness and zany comedy it s about an a student biggs as paul who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora suvari a ditzy heroin chic goth chick who has no ambition or self respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like hick boy paul is so we ve got a fish out water formula mixed with meet cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by clueless auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable it s as if everyone under age is a stoned raver there s no background or details to anyone or anything it s just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other not to mention the story itself which is virtually non existant and contains so many plotholes it s like swiss cheese even the basic editing is bad if you re looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all if you ve seen the commericials you ve seen all the funny parts which are all from the first five minutes 
long ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and i mean tragic life of novalee nation natalie portman hitting the road with her hick guitar playing boyfriend in a rusted out gm novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby due in a month stopping off at a nearby wal mart for a quick rest novalee s boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal mart because she s not the brightest bulb in the stagelights a wacky librarian keith david comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store then the she moves in with a family befriends everyone in town including ashley judd s character who has five kids and still can work part time as a nurse fights off religious freaks survives a tornado breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her receives an inheritance builds a martha stewart esque house becomes an award winning photographer and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot all while not once doing anything with her kid this film is terrible the directing is awful it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them over and over and over again we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman who can do good work a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal mart parking lot an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters making the audience ill taking two great comedic screenwriters babaloo mandel and lowell ganz and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah s book club altogether it has the feeling of being trapped at home watching a very bad television mini series and wishing it to end only the remote is broken however the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up where is the heart no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk 
best remembered for his understated performance as dr hannibal lecter in michael mann s forensics thriller manhunter scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight he s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do if you want to see some brilliant acting check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach s hidden agenda cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l i e which lot picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge big john feels the love that dares not speak its name but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light he s an even tempered funny robust old man who actually listens to the kids problems as opposed to their parents and friends both caught up in the high wire act of their own confused lives he ll have sex for pay with them only after an elaborate courtship charming them with temptations from the grown up world l i e stands for long island expressway which slices through the strip malls and middle class homes of suburbia filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a pretty transparent metaphor of dangerous escape for his year old protagonist howie paul franklin dano in his opening voice over howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road citing the l i e highway deaths of filmmaker alan j pakula songwriter harry chapin and his own mother on exit he s both fascinated and disturbed by the l i e and those feelings are projected onto big john who follows howie around in his bright red car but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn t want to do this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies he s a beast but ashamed of it l i e would have worked best as a half hour short film about howie s ill advised foray into big john s haven there is unnecessary padding with howie s miserable dad bruce altman in the hot seat for a white collar crime degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle class houses and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise ass gary terrio billy kay a handsome artful dodger rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui not that we needed another movie on that subject these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length concurrently the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted cox sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo is all bluff and bluster dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent we re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious calling haley joel it s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene the restraint is admirable but l i e s screenplay doesn t always give them the best material when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem the moment feels a bit too precious director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach s goldberg variations it s too much there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john s other boy toy walter masterson jealous over the newbie this plot thread predictably leads to violence not content to be a haunting observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world like terry zwigoff s superb ghost world cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note it s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex philosophical note in this regard l i e and countless other indie films share something in common with blockbuster action films problems are solved when the obstacle is removed how often does real life work this way to extend the question if a movie is striving for realism do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion 
 party camp is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ve seen in awhile a late rip off of the meatballs series the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk that s really about all that can be said about the plot because nothing much happens except that the main character wise cracking jerry andrew ross has the hots for a cute blonde kerry brennan and there is a big contest in the climax how fun since party camp has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative it s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick at least then it wouldn t have been such a chore to sit through never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat the comedy was easy to spot but it wasn t the least bit funny it was groan inducing constantly throghout i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything so what saves party camp from the dreaded zero star rating well that s simple jewel shepard as a flighty bimbo was admittedly fun to watch although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash at least if the film had centered on shepard she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid low budget teen comedy 
some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone in the movie has turned off their brains the real mccoy is both it s charmless molasses slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta where the real mccoy is set might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy kim basinger being arrested in the middle of a job six years later karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight she soon bumps into j t barker val kilmer a hapless would be thief who idolizes karen j t also has ties to jack schmidt terence stamp the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him schmidt who is in cahoots with karen s sleazy parole officer gailard sartain again wants karen to help him stage a robbery this time he has some leverage karen s kidnapped son just when she thought she was out they keep pulling her back in contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them leading the list is the jack schmidt character who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime let alone why he would actually participate in the break in karen s initial encounter with j t during a botched convenience store hold up also strains the limits of credibility it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point but instead they run into each other the next day because they re leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment small world eh then there s the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape and pet tigers which through the power of the laws of bad cinema must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage however the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day but the fun doesn t end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne there is also the absence of a single solitary interesting character karen is earnest and single minded in her motherly devotion but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material schmidt is a flaccid villain the parole officer is a complete blank and karen s son and ex husband might as well be furniture only kilmer s j t is remotely appealing but his one potentially intriguing quality his ineptitude is never developed in fact kilmer disappears during the middle of the film just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub plot i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever and some end with no reason evident why they didn t end up on the cutting room floor even the reasonably clever climactic break in falls victim to this syndrome including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts i kid you not four minutes there is no tension in the scene just tedium russell mulcahy highlander is a director with some style and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good but he completely stumbles in the editing room there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i m tempted to overlook the little ones like karen disarming one of schmidt s henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later tempted but i m pretty good at resisting temptation 
birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives are we doing what we want to be doing what happened to our dreams with the new millennium our collective big birthday just around the corner some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren t doing it for many anymore and they re looking for something else we ll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years ricky hayman jeff goldblum is having a career crisis the programming director for the good buy home shopping network he s going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically new producer kate newell kelly preston is supposed to whip things into shape when the two are fixing a flat they almost run down new age pilgrim g murphy g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don t really want all that commercial crap in some unexplained manner this causes sales to sour ricky is saved the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all it s not an over the top comedy or a heart warming message of humanity it is a mish mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog i am willing to put up with preaching from a film but the messages here are old hat you should take time to smell the roses selling your soul for cash is a bad idea golly i m glad i saw the movie i never would have thought of these the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed when g takes a chainsaw to the set there s an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious it doesn t happen the bits are so subdued and overly long that there s only a hint of laughter from the audience murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better there are hints of promise in this one the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen the others are horrendous goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his invasion of the body snatchers his relationship with kate makes no sense they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value an attempt to satirize stupid television we get a self parody instead 
susan granger s review of america s sweethearts columbia sony what a waste of a talented cast billy crystal and co writer peter tolan have concocted a sly provocative premise and as the opening credits roll it s obvious that they re attempting an old fashioned romantic comedy the story involves a veteran publicist billy crystal who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director christopher walken holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room refusing to show it to anyone he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film s once married but now estranged stars gwen and eddie catherine zeta jones john cusack they ll be so distracted that they won t remember they didn t see the movie or it wasn t what they expected and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic david manning quote scandal for help he turns to gwen s personal assistant sister julia roberts but the laughs are few and far between crystal s glib cynical flack isn t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one liners after six months under the care of a depak chopra like guru alan arkin cusack s character s too emotionally fragile lacking the necessary charisma zeta jones s vain narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one dimensional only hank azaria as zeta jones s much macho spanish lover and stanley tucci as a studio exec and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth basically we don t like these ego driven stereotypical characters let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements and joe roth s direction is predictable formulaic and telegraphic on the granger movie gauge of to america s sweethearts is a contrived shallow as a screwball satire it s strictly superficial 
michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels many of which are science fiction the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel congo failed and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good the film is expensive over one hundred million dollars is long minutes has a terrific cast including dustin hoffman samuel l jackson and sharon stone but has little that is really original and less that is exciting several years ago dr norman goodman played by dustin hoffman was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered the plan he wrote was only semi serious but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes peter coyote to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early s suddenly norman s less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams samuel l jackson biologist beth halperin sharon stone and astrophysicist ted fielding liev schreiber together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects the problem here is he is making a big budget science fiction film it has some effects but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer s imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting that could be a reasonable approach in a low budget film but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put they don t hoffman s acting seems muted jackson seems to laid back we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody s guess a cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors most science fiction spectaculars these days have second tier actors and first tier special effects levinson tries second tier effects and first tier actors but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer perhaps sci fi spectaculars are just not an actor s medium the result gets a on the to scale and on the to scale 
maybe this mission should have been scrubbed mission to mars a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman there s a world of difference between artists and technicians the artist has a vision to create something new he may not do it well it might be sloppy but it s something you ve never seen before a good technician can make it look good but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else it s going to be just a xerox obviously successful films need both skills brian de palma is a masterful technician he s spent his career copying others most notably hitchcock he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work but only because he has learned it by rote aside from rare flashes of originality his films are often soul dead in de palma s latest he turns his attention to stanley kubrick to tell the truth i enjoyed portions of this movie but i liked it a lot better over years ago when it was called i enjoyed it even more when it was titled close encounters nasa has set its sights for mars when the first crew meets with disaster a rescue mission is sent to the red planet they don t do so well either but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut gone rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe and it s all so boring there are so many scenes that just don t work it s difficult to begin when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside down martian tornado which looks remarkably like a sandworm from dune destroying everything in its path they just hang out watching error the most interesting character and that s not saying much is killed off error the alien is laughable error the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable error there s some nice eyecandy the face on mars which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head looks cool a three dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic but there s so much more that feels as if we ve been there before from there s the rotating space station the blinding white room from close encounters they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens the list goes on the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues even gary sinise and tim robbins can t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing no one seems to care about anything that happens you won t either the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr pepper with a foot tall logo saves the day they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film 
 return to horror high wants to be a couple different types of movies at once the film tells the story of a low budget horror movie being filmed at the closed down crippen high a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before but what the cast and crew don t know is that a real killer maybe the same one that was never apprehended is going into action again on one level return to horror high is a slasher movie and it is at this level that it works the best on watching the film which was made in i couldn t help but take notice that the killer s costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in scream and scream on another level the film wants to be a slapstick comedy and there are many hints of this throughout unfortunately most of these jokes fall flat and the last thing the film wants to be is a behind the scenes look at an exploitation film being made the only problem is that while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made no cameras are shown filming it thus making it far more confusing than it had to be and to top it all off the twist ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through if you see the film or have seen it you ll know what i mean the premise of return to horror high is admittedly pretty crafty and i liked the atmosphere of the school which is where the whole thing takes place but director froehlich judging from this movie is an incompetent director except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene well come to think of it there is only one scene that is actually scary and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in but other than that two minute distraction return to horror high is certainly no great shake note look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film and strangely enough he is the first character to get the ax literally 
synopsis two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry woody harrelson an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye has ill timed fits of coughing and fails at everything he does the story is told from harry s point of view harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn t drink one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea elisabeth shue who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn t smoke seduced harry agrees to participate in a money making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette chloe sevigny the teenage daughter of a rich man turns out it s all part of a needless very puzzling extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme it involves hiring special impersonators by two cons in order to fool harry a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post when the kidnapped odette is found dead the clues point to harry as the kidnapper murderer and the police are hot on harry s trail harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money can he get out of this mess opinion palmetto is a long uninteresting film with all the wrong feel hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof but palmetto is played like a dark serious detective noir drama and watching harry s bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction there s a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts buttocks short skirts colored painted nails and women s legs even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue s breast forming a prominent foreground towards the end palmetto re focuses on plot for the grand finale a confusing explanation involving impersonators with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals confession if you can imagine shemp from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo lingerie suspense thriller that s how out of synch this movie feels 
if you haven t plunked down your hard earned money yet for wild wild west the latest summer holiday offering from will smith let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck s frappacino or on a ben jerry s sundae these treats are great relief from the summer heat in contrast this film made me simmer in disappointment i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat this was true of star wars episode i but at least in that film the story and the characters were still in the back seat in this film they are no where to be found what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats lots of female extras who look like can can dancers and a clunky foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula two men are asked to stop this threat one is artemus gordon kevin kline an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest the other man is jim west will smith who prefers the shoot first then shoot some more method of investigating although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate two man vaudevillian act for example there is a scene where west being more debonair than the reserved gordon notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat which is what it is currently filled with now touch my breast west says gordon does so and then softly coos his approval i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness the script fails to generate any sense of drama humor or fun for that matter i did enjoy kline s reserved performance but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he s not even required to act it was as if the director was yelling will smith do your own thing and action here s an example in this scene will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people he must endear himself to the crowd to escape the director yells will smith do your own thing and action in another scene he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades will smith do your own thing and action worse still the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look there s actually a lot of imagination at work in this film there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat and that s too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his thing this film might have been palatable as it turns out wild wild west is the wild wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year

susan granger s review of ghosts of mars sony pictures entertainment horror auteur john carpenter halloween vampires strikes out with this sci fi eco fable that s so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green lit the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year s pitch black involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood thirsty marauding aliens in the year there are earthlings on mars living in a matriarchal society led by a commander played by pam grier grier pill poppin natasha henstridge and some rookie mars police officers clea duvall jason statham travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch desolation williams that s ice cube to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder but when they re besieged by demented zombie like body snatching miners they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and soon after most of the miners went bonkers as long dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies lopping off heads as vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet according to a scientist joanna cassidy carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the night of the living dead like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed along with the order of their elimination on the granger movie gauge of to ghosts of mars thuds to a laborious bottom of the barrel perhaps indeed there is a curse on mars films if you recall two other duds mission to mars and red planet 
at the end of an action scene in lara croft tomb raider a wall collapses near the nubile warrior with her face on the floor she gazes into the rubble then grins abruptly and says oh my car keys i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile based on an incredibly popular video game lara croft tomb raider is a lousy movie the structure goes like this poorly staged action sequence boring exposition poorly staged action sequence boring exposition etc etc the end basically the film exists to showcase angelina jolie s puffy lips and enhanced tits close ups are framed oh so carefully to include her million dollar bazooms running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage baywatch fashion there s even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them but the filmmakers are so inept they can t even flash the audience correctly the one extended display of nudity is of get ready for this a guy for no particular reason a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about seconds with each shot composed to barely cover his package la austin powers now i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t a flick aimed at heterosexual males of course what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right tomb raider sets up elaborate action set pieces then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts it promises a series of exotic locales then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons intended to be a rousing indiana jones style adventure tomb raider lacks any sense of tension the low point comes when lara is threatened by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun if you ever have to be chased by monsters pray that you get the monkey warriors tomb raider tells a story sort of once every years the planets align a group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that if reassembled just as the planets align will give them control over time itself lara s goal is to stop them and rescue her long missing poppa jon voight jolie s real life dad none of this matters though because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of lara croft tomb raider is as lame as ever other aspect of the film except angelina jolie s lips and breasts 
plot something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non horror movies oh yeah there s also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit but trust me you won t care much about the plot in this film critique parody movies either work or they don t and this one just doesn t work the laughs aren t as pronounced this time around the energy level the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here it s like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something wink wink and the scariest part of it all check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy seven i say again it took seven people to write minutes worth of fart jokes half assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror now i m not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed funny sketch ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on saturday night live there are a couple of funny one liners but mostly just rehashed one joke scenes a lot of dead silence and lame gags add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here the film s website isn t even up yet what the f i do however have to give it up to james woods the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all the exorcist take off miss this and you ve missed any reason to see the flick i especially liked his one liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman s head turning very funny unfortunately the film plummets straight down after that with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude where s my car and other action movies like charlie s angels and mission impossible now help me figure this one out will you isn t this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies or maybe that s just the title of the film f ing with my head well i m sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame ass script the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers money instead of the zucker brothers comedy for this sequel unfortunately for us all we re left with here is a skeleton of a film which might ve been funny had it been worked over a few more times tightened up here and there and been injected with more solid laughs but as things stand now there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year s film has led everyone down this path so screw them for not trying as hard critically speaking of course you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough real effort into this chop job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents pooh on you that s telling em joblo sheesh btw i m allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson whose massive breasts and skanky g string had me chompin at the bit you go girl everyone else stay where s joblo coming from airplane airplane ii galaxy quest hannibal the haunting mafia naked gun scary movie top secret 
the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze gone is seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry cage is legendary retired car thief memphis raines don t you love cute movie names who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick headed brother ribisi from being killed seems a murderous crime boss eccleston with a fetish for wood insert your own joke hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive exotic autos fifty cars to be exact poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly if the cars aren t delivered in three days bossman has a casket carved out just for kip literally if only someone could save him hmmmm wonder what memphis is doing in order to give the film some emotional heft there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of yawn excuse me dramatic tension shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe lindo who s looking to send memphis away will he catch him there s old flame sway jolie who had her heart broken by memphis years ago will they get back together shortsighted thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother yet resents him for moving away from the family will they reconnect raines old mentor duvall has long since left the life of crime will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life one more time can you answer all these questions correctly in seconds without seeing the film first i ll bet you can following the opening credits which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis he s first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go carts in a later scene as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control all the while making breakfast a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it looks like everything might turn out alright after all you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins that s about as strong as the characterization gets which is a shame bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis or maybe it s just the cars duvall trots out his ornery but sweet old codger outfit i m sure he s still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one lindo projects a warm hearted but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones who plays a mute accomplice of memphis without saying a word he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie like a blast of nitrous oxide he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal too bad his minutes onscreen are so few somehow bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept poorly written movies gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes every time something clever happens it s counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you re watching a movie there s a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot it s counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver s test imagine the yuks there s a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick it s countered by the lame semi subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk the ramifications are never explored then there s the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars not only is it stupid but it s against the law this is a movie made of pretty but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along gone in seconds aptly describes how long it ll take for this marginally entertaining but empty film to leave your memory 
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink and a concussive nudge bombast o rama con air the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill fated bar room brawl the prison scenes are accompanied by voice overs in which poe in a languid southern drawl describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity it probably should cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim witted and ridiculous and that he s going to have to do something to keep himself entertained and thus he slips into a familiar surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings cage plays cameron poe as a buffed up version of raising arizona s h i mcdonnough cage should have known what he was getting himself into he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock and if there s one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production even without his late partner don simpson it s that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the last bruckheimer production the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage s performance in the rock cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self awareness while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home cage s goal is different but just as simple to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact audiences too should know what they re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production in fact the marketing people are counting on it no one who loathed the rock for its swear grunt blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded director simon west yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab s soda fountain delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture it s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma like insulin con air does the work of a gland what he doesn t deliver is a moment of suspense a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock s notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk a really really big desk and a really really big bomb will serve the purpose nicely if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension they might have done something with con air s creepiest set up at a desert stop for the plane load of convicts serial killer garland greene steve buscemi wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool their tete a tete is eerie and menacing providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains danny trejo ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them in fact con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement too many characters too much editing too many dopey punch lines too much of the cheap ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack as a u s marshal goes for earnest cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies it doesn t bode well for cage s appearance in face off later this month perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over there s a word for people like you nicolas that word is called recidivist repeat offender 
the film may be called mercury rising but that title doesn t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture a routine thriller that combines government cover ups with a cloying and poorly motivated buddy story the hook that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic however aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device those expecting to see even a semi thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard to swallow i don t know whether the problem is in the original book simple simon or in the screenplay adaptation but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible once again certain standby plot elements the high level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent are recycled and not to good effect while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold art jeffries bruce willis is confronted with his own failure unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy handedly establishes his motivation for protecting year old simon lynch miko hughes when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player soon art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time with the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player always just a step behind them along the way they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy chi mcbride and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest kim dickens why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex football player apparently the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra secret code called mercury to make sure it can t be cracked they do the most intuitive thing possible place a sample of it in a nerds puzzle magazine of course no one can solve it no one except autistic simon that is when he calls the phone number listed in the solution he gets the nsa as a result the cold hearted sneering government man alec baldwin decides that simon has to be eliminated for the good of the country of course but he hasn t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold even though everyone in the audience has it s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn t do anything exceptionally well and does quite a few things rather poorly for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time to time but even the most exciting scenes such as the one where art and simon are crouched down avoiding passing trains aren t that pulse pounding the climactic struggle is a real ho hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness overall director harold becker is constantly struggling and failing to generate even a moment that isn t derivative or obligatory bruce willis star seems to be fading this is his fourth straight lackluster outing following last man standing the fifth element and the jackal willis isn t terrible but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through and often does alec baldwin combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice does some scenery chewing but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace the film s real star is young miko hughes heather langenkamp s son in wes craven s new nightmare who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual but is about years younger mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain the replacement killers and u s marshals on the heap of pallid thrillers for those who like action and adventure in the theater this has not been a good year hopefully the advent of summer will change that until then the best choices for bruce willis or any other action hero are on video and if you re determined to see mercury rising check out the morning sky in early may 
so ask yourself what mm eight millimeter is really all about is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography is it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of big town americana there s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires or is it about those who can those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see i m not talking about snuff films supposed documentaries of victims being brutalized and killed on camera i m talking about films like mm and its director joel schumacher with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit batman robin a time to kill batman forever the client schumacher certainly has that kind of influence is mm something you really want to see probably not the first two thirds of mm unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama albeit with a particularly unsavory core then as it s been threatening all along the film explodes into violence and just when you think it s finally over schumacher tags on a ridiculous self righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further trust me there are better ways to waste two hours of your life nicolas snake eyes cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband s safe documents a young girl s murder welles goes about his assignment rather matter of factly and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly almost as if you don t need any specialized skills or training to do this welles certainly makes it look easy and cops obviously never look in toilet tanks for clues the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes like george c scott in paul schrader s hardcore occasionally a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector reminding him of his unpleasant task there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife played by catherine keener who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split level home in harrisburg pa mm doesn t condemn or condone its subject matter it just exploits it the irony of course is that schumacher and seven scribe andrew kevin walker s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r rated first run hollywood product so we only see snippets of snuff and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror later it s the turn of joaquin phoenix who s quite good and by far the film s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again all this to get to the familiar yet offensive revelation that sexual deviants are not indeed monsters but everyday people like you and me neither super nor standard mm is shocking only in its banality 
one night during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets we went to see what else hard rain so are we all going to die the sheriff randy quaid asks in the story s opening line as he evacuates his flooded town the answer is pretty much yes but not nearly soon enough and to add insult to injury the supposedly dead regretfully often turn out not to be so populating this bad tv movie of the week material are a host of talented actors one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie graham yost s script serves up one cliche after another for the actors who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines director mikael salomon s staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies jr s dark and ugly cinematography the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie christian slater who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart plays tom edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie coming to their rescue is a gang headed by jim played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman he views the loot three million dollars worth as his retirement plan the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang who are in turn after tom along the way tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix weapon wielding woman named karen played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake christopher young s emotionless score for the film has a single trait ear shattering loudness the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks submerging the town the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other the show has a single but unprintable good line betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife and when her hen pecked husband finally told her off our audience roared with laughter the show concludes with a sickening set of twists the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad hard rain runs it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers the two families behind us shockingly had a half dozen preschoolers among them 
there s nothing quite like a gory anime really and this is the truth no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it with anime a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword this is a standard practice in anime or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ve seen vampire hunter d is a gory gory film if they ever made a live version of the film it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx it s not that it s gore is unique it s just like other gory animes but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it s story characters animation etc it really didn t it was disgusting and gruesome which overshadowed the story what little of it there was it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world because god knows that our local police force just can t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies one evening a blond peasant girl drawn to look and innocent a foreshadow that we will see her naked i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire insert strom thurmand joke here of course he never put a no trespassing sign on his yard so one can t really blame her but he s upset anyway and demands retribution she gets the obligatory bite on the neck aren t there other places to get blood from it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough if it s good enough for doctors to draw blood from then why do vampires stray from that sight to fight the spell she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall dark and handsome vampire hunter you guessed it his name is d the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires being attracted to the year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much you see like all heroes in these kinds of stories he s a brooder who s sole purpose in life is to remain really really silent when he speaks it s in cliches heroes like this are bad when they re live even worse when animated later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire who wants to marry the peasant girl because he s bored after years of living the only clever vampire insight made in the movie will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable in it s defense the animation when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing could at times be original the talking hand was clever and i think the inspiration for a skateboard related logo and that s the best defense i can think of i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans but i really don t see it it s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks and most importantly like all violent anime it is an excuse to see animated breasts why what is the point of that maybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny i m not a prude i just don t think it s warranted it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost is there a neccesity in seeing a year old in the shower of course not it s done for shock it s tasteless and despicable 
the scene at the end of s dead poets society when robin williams english students stand up on their desk and say captain my captain gets me every time unfortunately the court room scene near the end of robin s newest film patch adams doesn t have anywhere near the same impact from the surface patch adams looks very promising it s a story about a not so young man patch adams robin williams who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people when the film opens we find patch depressed and suicidal checking himself into a mental hospital in a few scenes strongly reminiscent of one flew over the cuckoo s nest he ends up helping the patients through their problems and it s here that he finds how much he loves working with people so he checks himself out of the hospital and heads straight to medical school right from the start patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry shortly after joining medical school he meets and falls in love with carin monica potter they along with patch s dork friend truman daniel london start a medical clinic for uninsured people once the dean catches wind of the clinic he tells patch he can t graduate and kicks him out of school patch like what any true american would do takes the school to court it s here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place over whether or not patch can become a real doctor i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it it seems more like a series of short sketches rather than a full length movie considering it runs almost two hours much too long for such a light film it could have flowed much smoother not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels but those moments are rare and in the end patch adams is barely average 
even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality like everyone else dreyfuss has bills to pay so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies consequently while his career highlights include jaws close encounters of the third kind stakeout and tin men his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador let it ride and now krippendorf s tribe let me start out by saying that krippendorf s tribe is occasionally funny although never riotously so but that s about its only asset the best word to describe this film is asinine the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes which are aimed at someone going through puberty krippendorf s tribe tries to be a zany off the wall comedy but the film makers have forgotten three important rules the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist the second is that viewers should be able to identify with or at least care about a character or two finally and most importantly more than of the jokes have to work once upon a time james krippendorf dreyfuss was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a lost tribe somewhere in the wilds of new guinea a goal which they never accomplished shortly after their return from the failed trip krippendorf s wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children shelly natasha lyonne mickey gregory smith and edmund carl michael linder on his own now over a year later the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf which he has spent not on research but on things for his family so they send a new member of their faculty professor veronica micelli jenna elfman to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings when he arrives at the college for the momentous event rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe the shelmikedmu to provide video footage he films his children dressed in native garb soon much to krippendorf s surprise the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon but one disaffected professor lily tomlin is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud the only way krippendorf s tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters not to mention the viewers are dumber than dirt unfortunately it s impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags meanwhile attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture i e how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend come across as feeble and derivative the acting in underwhelming dreyfuss has definitely not given his all to the role of james krippendorf alongside him jenna elfman the spunky co star of tv s dharma and greg radiates perkiness and little else this quality while fine for a minute television program quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature length movie no one in the supporting cast lily tomlin david ogden stiers natasha lyonne woody allen s daughter in everyone says i love you excels i know that a movie s in trouble when it s half the length of titanic but seems much longer most of what comes on screen is generic sit com level material the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set if there s any upside it s that i don t see much box office support developing for this lame ill marketed miscue krippendorf s tribe will quickly become extinct 
a couple of criminals mario van peebles and loretta devine move into a rich family s house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels however someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them writer mario van peebles delivers a clever script with several unexpected plot twists but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work editing and pacing it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark but alas there was still more minutes to go daniel baldwin i can t believe i m about to type this gives the best performance in the film outshining the other talented members of the cast r 
unfortunately it doesn t get much more formulaic than one tough cop there s the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film bo dietl pronounced deedle baldwin is one tough cop a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia on top of that problem he has a drunk gambling addicted partner penn who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets i guess cops aren t immune then throw into the mix the femme fatale gershon right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama but right in the middle of the film they throw in a completely un related plot point dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death once the case is solved the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso an insult if you ask me the performances were pretty good baldwin though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec does a fine job as one tough cop penn who also slips into an impression of his brother sean is even better as a loser tough guy cop what one tough cop lacks is originality this film offers nothing new nothing that you can t get from any cop film it screams sidney lumet all over the place perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman producers of lumet s dog day afternoon and serpico but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film too much else is lacking i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture something that i almost never notice but once i saw that i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot at times i was hoping to see it one tough cop isn t laughable nor is it a terrible film but it just isn t unique it is a classic example of a film that didn t need to be made but one thing is for sure it could really use a better title 
wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions over black and white drawings we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation induced mutation the original inhabitants of the earth fairies and elves return to populate the globe along with their evil mutant counterparts one day and i say one day not to be trite but because that s exactly how it happened no advance notice a fairy queen gives birth to twins one good and one evil the twins grow up to be powerful wizards the good one embracing magic and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology as unoriginal as the premise is i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out there s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world after all i soon learned however that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film once the transition was made from still art to color animation an entirely different feel takes precedence rather than the epic saga promised by the narration we get a goofy looking world of a saturday morning cartoon not just the look mind you but all the zany sounds like honk boing for years blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined however blackwolf now has a secret weapon nazis yup adolf hitler the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht okay not the real things but an archival film his minions dug up projected into the sky for all to see it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up before you know it there are dead elves everywhere this is just as well the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn t care about any of them they re either silly sappy or both the dialog gets much of the credit for this an example is when avatar nonchalantly says well looks like my brother and i begin our final battle not very formidable when he s also the guy who says this is the biggest bummer of a trip i ve ever been on my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can t fight back against the nazi charged evil her response is they have weapons and technology we just have love suffice to say the characters are strictly two dimensional and we therefore don t expect anything more than the obvious to happen which it does the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out which is anticlimactic and disappointing please note that it is the action that is unexpected that it is disappointing is not the film couldn t settle on a particular mood it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity the dramatics which seem to occur at random are overly staged and overly acted detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned ralph bakshi the director makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film hitler and the nazis were bad so who doesn t know this already well maybe children okay so you might say that this is a movie for children it s not in the scenes where good fights evil there s a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they re watching a cartoon so is the film for adults if so we probably don t need to be bashed over the head to get the point why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes and hitler giving speeches however we don t see any reason why they should be considered bad we see no atrocities being committed not even any real battle footage there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich and we re not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment i d like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere at any time and we must therefore be vigilant however i m not sure if i want to give him that much credit 
in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early s came this french canadian co production by max fischer the movie is set in paris where its hero struggling american author david mirkine judd nelson at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity suffers a terrible writers bloc he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle laurence treill unfortunately she hangs out in jet set circles which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous her connection with powerful david caravan pierce brosnan would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller drama would probably be more appropriate genre label pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments low budget also becomes painfully visible and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film unfortunately this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed instead they would have to settle with pointless slow scenes involving nelson brosnan and laurence treill s attempts of serious acting all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone s precious time 
 saving silverman is a good example of a good comedy gone bad as a love story it is good however as a comedy it falls flat on it s face i think throughout the short minutes i laughed a total of seven times and those were just chuckles at the most the movie doesn t have the oomph to make it a great movie and doesn t have the script to make it a funny movie wayne lefessier steven zahn j d mcnugent jack black and darren silverman jason biggs have grown up all their lives together they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end while in a bar after doing a show with their band based on their love of neil diamond darren meets a young woman named judith amanda peet whom he instantly falls for wayne and j d however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again it s up to wayne and j d to try and begin saving silverman the performances are topnotch and surprisingly they are what keep the movie afloat jason biggs right off the flop loser does an ok job playing silverman but he is stale and flat at times steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier and even though the movie is about silverman lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself jack black is well jack black and he does an all right job as j d but he isn t as funny as he has been in the past amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith and neil diamond plays neil diamond he s better at singing than acting anyway the performances in the film are good but it s too bad the script isn t speaking of script hank nelkan s choppy script is not only badly written but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street the trailer for the movie as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie especially the funniest parts somewhere saving silverman was meant to be a good movie and it could have been but alas in the end it wasn t dennis dugan s direction is all right he adds a few directorial touches here and there nothing special being a simple comedy saving silverman is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one it has a great cast a good director and a sweet story it s just too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie 
 alcohol and drugs bad not alcohol and drugs good got it just when you though you ve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen be that insanity or alcoholism hollywood releases yet another one of those deep emotional stories about finding yourself days is practically a visualization of the usual meaningful true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa meetings gwennie sandra bullock is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol for her life was a big party with no beginning and no end this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper dominic west borrowed her sister s elizabeth perkins wedding limo and crashed it into someone s house this time she had to pay with a day stay in court ordered rehab here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption willpower and commitment most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party the film itself feels like a rehab program whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times it is a classic cautionary tale an echo a big fat and expensive clich a shadow of last year s girl interrupted which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like the cuckoo s nest and trainspotting director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama comedy jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues alienation despair terror confusion loneliness and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean isn t that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park betty thomas idea of hell is a cozy homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke drink or watch tv after it is simply too light simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story all you need to do is just say no says dr cornell steve buscemi as if was the revelation of the century and that s how simple it is in fact i would rather watch lost in space once again than return to days as for acting it s acceptable but hardly anything else for sandra bullock it s an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than speed she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop dominic west shines as the source of gwenie s devilish temptations but elizabeth perkins and steve buscemi s great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters although intellectually girl interrupted was a greater achievement days is superior in its visual aspect there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor the most important thing is that we ve seen it before and it was a lot better clean and sober only when i laugh when a man loves a woman leaving las vegas and many other stronger films were made about the same issues so what s the point in other words days doesn t contribute to the moviemaking business on any level if you re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you re standing in front of the movie theatre you might as well go in and watch days under all other circumstances stay away because this film equals and minutes lost 
breakdown is an moderately entertaining if underwhelming thriller kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor taking the scenic route to california through redneck country however while in the middle of nowhere their jeep decides to break down leaving them stranded a friendly truck driver warren walsh offers to give them a lift to town although jeff rejects the offer he wants to stay with his car amy agrees hops into warren s lorry and promptly disappears jeff wonders where the hell she is and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance and the vanishing plot wise the latter two are far superior character and script wise kurt russell is o k as jeff although he can seemingly only pull of one expression which is angry throughout the whole film he looks angry or just pissed off quinlan is o k again but again she can only pull off one expression which is looking dorky throughout the whole film she looks dorky j t walsh who sadly recently passed away is fine as warren who we soon find out is a kidnapper although his actual character is pretty weak and not really menacing enough the supporting cast do their best aswell with rex linn as a doubting sheriff and the other kidnappers the story written by first timer jonathan mostow who also directs is o k if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy there are some flaws with the plot also as the characters do the complete opposite to logical presumably to keep the story exciting and also the fact that the story just isn t strong enough to sustain the audience s attention the picture moves along very slowly also it almost threatens to drop dead the picture does pick up towards the end but by then it s too late mostow directs the action sequences well enough however the film doesn t really come to a satisfying conclusion either the ending tries to be bleak but just comes off annoying breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director instead it just turns out to be merely average a missed opportunity overall rating review by david wilcock 
an american werewolf in london is john landis groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects more specifically the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf and for the ghosts that haunt the main character even twenty years after its release that part of the movie is still impressive although i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure if it weren t for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in and with good reason the acting isn t great and neither is the writing well ok we don t actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film but one other important element is lacking here too it isn t scary with no exception you know what is going to happen before it happens you don t even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen but john it just wasn t scary i didn t know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it but it didn t work for me actually it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad the intended humor was lost on me it s never a good sign that you don t realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material call me crazy but you shouldn t have to do research on a movie to enjoy it i m not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up werewolf bites boy david naughton boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse jenny agutter and then strange things begin to happen to boy including and i must admit this is a very nice touch visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse i know it sounds strange but it actually works the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy griffin dunne are really the best parts of the movie as i said probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects while they are still impressive today they aren t impressive enough or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film and since they are more or less the highlight of the film there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch actually the sequel an american werewolf in paris is more entertaining since it doesn t take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way 
you know something christmas is not about presents it s about over hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie ins at least that would seem to be the message of the grinch which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season you know the plot there s this evil furry green guy called the grinch jim carrey who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas the movie is of course a live action version of the beloved children s book which was previously adapted into a tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones it s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty year old half hour cartoon but that s the case when jones version is compared to ron howard s the tv grinch hit all the right notes boris karloff s soft deep narration thurl ravenscroft singing mr grinch max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head and the grinch s wide toothless grin by contrast the movie hits one sour note after another first there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a minute movie young wide eyed cindy lou who taylor momsen is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents bill irwin and molly shannon during the holiday season she begins to sympathize with the grinch who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class martha may whovier played as an adult by christine baranski are we expected to like the grinch hate the whos and want him to steal christmas the grinch isn t even the villain here that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville jeffrey tambor who was the grinch s rival for martha s affection not only are the characters needlessly complex but the once simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought the casting choices aren t any better than the screenwriting decisions jim carrey seems woefully miscast while his face is so supple that the rubber make up seems superfluous carrey brings nothing else to the role his accent keeps changing i assume he was shooting for karloff but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon sean connery and cartman from south park not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch s home carrey falls back on his stand up comedy and clowns around ace ventura style needless to say his wise cracking antics don t quite fit the character of the grinch who is an embittered loner filled with hate little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story finding santa in her living room stealing the tree however the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch and momsen is not up to the challenge bottom line when you re stealing christmas movies leave this one behind 
synopsis sullen julie james still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas arriving at the start of the hurricane season julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they ve walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand comments i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five i am only vaguely aware of the show s premise and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half paid attention to while watching the tube party of five i do know however seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre neve campbell scream queen of the s and star of scream scream and the craft is a regular of the show so too is jennifer love hewitt lo and behold following in the footsteps of campbell hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own the i know what you did last summer line though the original film released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater s glowing red exit sign longingly throughout jennifer love hewitt is a very good looking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles with acting she just isn t convincing in this film and she wasn t in the original either this puts many young males including myself in a paradoxical quandary she s very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girl type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize exploitatively her figure add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience i ve spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason i still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses nothing else here is original or interesting this movie in fact makes other recent so so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter s vampires seem like stunning works of high art i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches an isolated location a storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots of blue lighted darkness scenes a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer s hook they may as well have huge targets painted on them like scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief unfortunately i still know s characters aren t all that funny in particular one character a chain weed smoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn t die soon enough the death scenes by the way are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film several of them are uncomfortable to watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser bloodline a truly sadistic movie this too did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for and what is the deal with the slasher himself i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror come on the guy looks like the gorton s fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate though his lightning lit appearances ellicited much needed laughter in the theater his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film and that s really saying something so all that s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy both prance about in tightfitting revealing outfits or in various states of undress yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene hewitt however does do a post shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite titillating this scene alone made this one star turkey earn two stars under my rating system otherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves early in the film for instance brandy wins the trip to the bahamas she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever i needed extra strength tylenol after that part oh and the film s conclusion talk about repetitive people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know s ending at least minutes before it happens boring i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater admission is only one dollar on wednesdays and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them it s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience who don t seem to mind participating in a mass mystery science theater type viewing i still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad it really is if it weren t for the main actresses revealing wardrobes i d have had a very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel i can t imagine trying to watch it on video horror films seem times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and wouldn t recommend it to people unless they re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works what a depressing thought hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act rated r this film contains lots of violence several gory scenes and a couple nubile horny teenagers though the sex act itself is always thwarted i d say this is unsuitable for kids but teens wouldn t have a problem sitting through it especially since they obviously compose the film s target audience 
phaedra cinema the distributor of such never heard of classics as soft toilet seats trailer the movie and the one armed boxer vs the flying guillotine has sneaked its latest release the sculptress into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare the sculptress is a scary proposition all right but not in the way its producers intended from the outset it s easy to see why some of the larger more reputable chains aren t carrying it the film looks like a straight to video release from the early s that s been dusted off not very carefully and re issued in theatrical format that staple of schlocky z movies jeff fahey the lawnmower man plays a washed up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills when he s not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment screaming scotch induced hamlet soliloquies well into the night he s out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women fahey s dobie sizes up his victims actually just one a peep show performer name of sylvie dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane dark glasses and a false beard just in time for halloween do you have a castle sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop jah with ze many turrets is dobie s perplexing reply the real star of the film and i use that term extremely loosely is katie wright who plays the sculptress of the title sarah is new in town studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a genius frenchman played by the beret wearing patrick bauchau that s convenient because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris you won t believe the film s final shot with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and rosemary s baby inspired imagery bauchau s character criticizes sarah s work publicly her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles perhaps she s possessed by an incubus but he still manages to talk her into dinner whereas wright does a decent english accent her talents pretty much end there on the other side of the wall dobie s troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like actor delivers a stunning macbeth actor courted by hollywood studio actor renounces hollywood for priesthood and prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal the film s plot could have been just as easily condensed artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath yawns ensue so dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes late in the film their paths finally cross with mind numbing results nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket but one old dear does go ballistic when sarah s bathtub overflows no we don t see wright in the tub or fahey for that matter and the gore quotient is virtually nil so for a horror film the sculptress is surprisingly lacking the only thing worth looking at is san francisco and writer director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary windswept and deserted the sculptress isn t even bad enough to be fun luckily a limited release has made it easy to avoid 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned quick robin the anti shark repellant adam west in the batman feature film casually kicking at a pathetic looking rubber shark attached to his leg i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard this is a disasterously bad film easily the worst in the series to date and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive it s loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman with chris o donnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemically induced villains the nefarious ice cold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss by ivy s side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson a grunting hulk of a beast the villains goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivy s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit by destroying all human life meanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone akiva goldsman s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad with astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful by the number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement it makes goldsman s screenplay of batman forever which i thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i d seen used in no joke an episode of gilligan s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production joel schumacher s direction of batman and robin is horrific with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case i suppose if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy s chosen new abode another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons mr schumacher s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible to the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all out camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film s opening even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered is batman and robin supposed to be campy i think it is it s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be i somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn t attempting to be the utter farce which it is arnold schwarzenegger is top billed in the film as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be mr schwarzenegger s attempts to be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable by the end of the film i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near unintelligble puns and one liners featuring every possible permutation of cool in the least inventive way george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin being overshadowed by the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film his batman is hardly an imposing figure chris o donnell is unimpressive in a one note performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all the film s one saving grace undoubtably uma thurman s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy her work in batman and robin is certainly over the top but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film ms thurman s comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully i m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey s performance in batman forever her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film and when she s offscreen the film greatly suffers i figure that if one has to die being kissed to death by uma thurman isn t a half bad way to go while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse pounding excitement i must admit that i was not bored watching it although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one liner and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat it s been a long time since i ve laughed so much at a movie at of course is the operative word 
it s been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci fi opus mission to mars and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar why the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera instead shooting for the angle of a feel good science fiction drama more akin to a space odyssey i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie going patrons were expecting another armageddon but no mission to mars certainly isn t one large action sequence about colossal disaster this is a supposedly thoughtful family friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel you have been warned of course crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible see apollo for an excellent example but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off when he gets his hands on an intelligent systematically practical script like the untouchables or mission impossible the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally of course there s also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name including snake eyes and the notorious bomb the bonfire of the vanities all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood that term may be too harsh but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is mission to mars my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient if i were gary sinise i wouldn t touch de palma with a foot pole sinise is a wonderful wonderful actor but after appearing in snake eyes and this vomit inducing sham i m sure he wouldn t want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration the academy award winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell a man who recently lost his wife kim delaney and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars oops forgot to mention the year after a barbecue get together for the astronauts we cut to luc goddard don cheadle and his team who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet suddenly a towering formation of rocks and soil probably best dubbed a sand tornado appears and creates a whirlwind of suction for some reason the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this as if it were a lovely piece of art the team is killed within seconds expect for luc who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive immediately a second mission consisting of astronauts mcconnell husband and wife woody and terri blake tim robbins and connie nielsen and phil ohlmyer jerry o connell are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars let s put the secret on hold for now and discuss the trip there it is explained whether scientifically accurate or not probably not that a trip to mars takes roughly six months i m not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind m m didn t capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia instead we join the team during their final days aboard the ship what happened during the five months prior to this did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes still there are few nicely tense moments maybe the only in the movie during the time frame involving a fuel leak depalma s direction is quite good in these scenes although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent organ music in space c mon there s a few good imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud it s a colossal bummer that mission to mars is poorly assembled and laughably written with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists as mentioned before anyone looking for some disaster movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed maybe even cheated after the unbelievably hokey final shot with the words the end somehow adding insult to injury a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen others muttered obscenities shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling jeez that sucked okay it did suck but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy after all they do pretty well sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple and funnyman o connell well he has a couple lines are actually amusing and intentionally so the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive so by golly where did this mission go wrong looking back on the appalling experience i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have while watching mission to mars my suggestion would be to immediately abort or better yet don t even strap yourself in for lift off 
 marie couldn t talk paulie the parrot star of his own movie tells us about the daughter in his original family dad couldn t listen and mom couldn t cope so they got rid of me paulie the autobiography of a talking not merely a mimicking parrot has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird the voice not the body and as the minor character of benny a small time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms as the parrot mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up benny on the other hand is a character you ve seen a thousand times before and mohr brings nothing new to that role roberts s deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig s script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems when a kids movie wants to mosey along watch out if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium so it is with paulie when they let their bird do his stand up comedy routines the show hums and the audience roars too often however a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again tony shalhoub the smart mouthed chef from big night plays misha a recent russian immigrant to the u s he had been a teacher of literature at home but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study although misha gets a few nice lines i m russian i like long stories his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy besides paulie the only character worth noting other than cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands is the speech impaired marie played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer year old hallie kate eisenberg naturally enchanting she gives the picture genuine heart the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills when marie s family gets a cat for example the bird who hasn t wanted to learn how to fly until then takes an instant interest in soaring tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time paulie calls him a stupid hairball their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation it s good quality sitcom material but performed by animals when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing paulie cringes i m a bird he explains with his frequently subtle humor i have a small brain and it s about to explode the movie contains rich doses of john debney s dreamy music with heavy use of a solo violin he keeps reinforcing the film s heart warming themes and when paulie finally takes off in flight the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing it s a long story says paulie it s the only kind he knows reflects misha and the motion picture which runs the standard length for a kids movie still feels too long the best parts are enthralling but then there are all of those dead spots in between paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless paulie runs it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages my son jeffrey age gave the movie with his biggest complaint being that there wasn t enough action he thought paulie was funny and the actress that played marie was quite good his friend sam almost thought the movie was awesome excellent and gave it he thought paulie was good but he didn t believe the way marie s speech impediment was acted 
a backdrop of new year s eve in would seem to lend itself to a great party movie the decor possibilities are endless disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic big hair was worth its weight in aquanet and the louder the fashion the better the look but despite this setting these details and a soundtrack that includes some plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade something is inherently wrong with cigarettes a better title for this nostalgic mess would be missed opportunities what is it that makes this retro comedy such a downer it s certainly not the cast which includes enough hot young talent for several movies there s courtney love cementing her reputation as a serious actress christina ricci hot off her shoulda been nominated turn in the opposite of sex paul rudd who gets even more appealing with every role kate hudson inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn and affleck brothers ben and casey two of the best things about good will hunting perhaps the question is this what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project maybe it looked good on paper cigarettes is composed of a series of vignettes as various characters make their way through new york s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica martha plimpton all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin rudd and his best friend lucy love busy bickering over his recent break up and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ben affleck who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick up lines more subplots many more dot the big picture but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick s cube ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants out to have a high time in the big city infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several scene cameo hudson as a pretty in pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies man jay mohr trips pukes and gets smeared with dog poop are we laughing yet the film boils down to a mixture of the good the bad and the gaudy with the latter two overtaking the former game performances especially by love rudd and plimpton are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other if this is cigarettes then get me nicotine patches 
i m not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing disturbing behavior with scream maybe it s because they re both horror films kinda both have hot young stars both have an annoying alternative soundtrack and both are aimed at the teenage crowd which i guess includes me but this is not the next in line with the scream flicks as well as the i know what you did last summer soon to be flicks it owes less to halloween and more to kafka and orwell which in my book makes for a more interesting feature and it should have been this is basically a rehash of the stepford wives the great s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing as i ve been told with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives or something like that behavior starring katie holmes of dawson s creek deals with a bunch of teenagers deep in angst who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers suck ups preppies it actually at least to me sounds like it would work and with scott rosenberg that witty penmen who has written stuff like beautiful girls and things to do in denver when you re dead as well as con air it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit alas it s not and it plumets into that little group of movies known as the movies with potential that blow it i remember a film called white man s burden which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it s potentially brilliant premise here s another one it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves it s a stage and this film does in fact realize that it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly now it just needs to work as a film which it doesn t it s too sloppy and too contrived it paints a bleak portrait of high school life then lets it lie it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss ups who do food drives and hang out at a s diner drinking milk shakes then gives it a cheap twist when they get horny they become homicidal isn t it scary enough that they re like this and can t the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them not that you could be next to die the film introduces us two three different characters who in the beginning are considered outsiders because they re not yet part of this clique the new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull who s having trouble at home because he hasn t gotten over his brother s ethan embry in quick flashes so you don t recognize him i did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawson s creek who s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and by far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without a face who s the most interesting because he s the only character who s given some dimension in the film s best scene he introduces steve to every single clique nailing each one s fetishes and hang ups and it s the best scene in the movie because it s witty satirical and interesting something the rest of this film isn t gavin suspects there s something awry with the preppie kids known as the blue ribbons and in the tradition of all conspirators and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve he s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff here we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him but he may have saved this film from being the dreary dull film that it is without gavin who gives it life and humor the only other half interesting character is the school janitor played by william sadler as a retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems to be but really we don t care anyway i probably shouldn t mention that this was directed by david nutter who s works for the x files because that would probably tarnish his reputation like the show he s good at setting up weird conspiracies and creating a general creepy feel most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect and some of it works but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff he keeps too much inside so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act you wonder why they just don t get the hell out of there i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom what this film needs to be is a lot longer a lot more colorful and a lot creepier if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor played by bruce greenwood an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed then they need to come up with a tougher smarter villain if he s so villainous then why could two dense teenagers who couldn t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes the film which runs about or so minutes just needs to work on these things and become a lot less sloppy at such a short running time and with such lame boring characters as these it s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one s mouth especially mine 
this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont s debut as a director surprise hit speed but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead annie sandra bullock is in the wrong place at the wrong time again she s going on a cruise with her new boy friend alex jason patric and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger willem dafoe who has a bone to pick with the shipping line they sacked him after he got sick now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship s safe for compensation that actually is the whole storyline speed could do without dialogues the movie is all about images and remarkable sound i don t really know why this is called an action movie except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the ies first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie then desaster strikes sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around i looked for the action but couldn t find it most of the time she is part of the decoration the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door now we know that she can handle a chain saw we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds the bomb defusal of course goes wrong but only the furniture is damaged not our heroes who still are needed jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie helping other passengers and frolicking in the water his initial sea sickness is suddenly gone because there are ship crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger he does a pretty good job but i can t blame keanu reeves for declining this part then there s willem dafoe the villain who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein s monster he doesn t succeed though an untidy appearance isn t enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror i can t really recommend speed you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren t meant to be funny especially the showdown when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie in keeping with last year s desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death a really funny and meant to be funny scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie had they looked out the window they wouldn t have missed the huge ship racing toward them those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects in an adequately equipped theater it s as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate but the ilm special effects can t save the movie for all the money they could have done better 
there have been bad films in recent years mr magoo was by far the worst ever made the spectacularly bad blue in the face the horrible baby genuises and now i woke up early the day i died it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie the film s acting if that s what you want to call it is well mediocre to me loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit boy was i wrong after escaping from a mental institution the thief played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty he turns to burglary to survive robs a loan back kills the loan officer and runs with thousands a country wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying a film which was based on a long lost script by ed wood i have only one question no dialogue only music and movement where exactly is the point the film moves along at a rather slow pace but does have one advantage the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some it opens with a fun innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that some of the low points are when the thief steals a woman s purse and then she faints sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom the thief kills to the music of psycho come on people get some new ideas already what s even worse is that the film has no plot at all well to a certain extent it does but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we re bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen i woke up early the day i died is a perfectly bad film it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie even with the huge cast talent the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours 
movies don t come much more ridiculously titled than i still know what you did last summer but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous the title sort of works as a warning more than a silly sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor this horror sequel s moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot what you did last summer you actually did the summer before last summer and since i knew about it this summer as well as last summer it s really illogical to say that i still know what you did last summer the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter i still know the longer i still know what you did two summers ago or the appropriate stupid people getting hacked to bits that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart for example if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress probably not but that s precisely what college student karla pop diva brandy does to best friend julie jennifer love hewitt resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights julie you ll recall was one of the sole survivors at the end of s surprise hit i know what you did last summer after a slasher with a grudge to bear it s a long story began trying to pick off her her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village in this installment the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas and julie yet racked by guilt decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind yeah right their island paradise has room of course for one more in the form of the still alive killer muse watson from the first film he sports the same gorton s fisherman get up a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity but why he s still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves though i suppose his hook hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit in a sense that s the movie s glaring flaw everybody knows who the bad guy is thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary but trey callaway s derivative i still know screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all what does he do he twist ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays you d think he d want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later even prequel summer lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh the innovative gallows humor that scribe and scream wunderkind kevin williamson injected into i know s unfolding story is sorely missed replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like yo you ll cheer not shriek when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest if i know what you did last summer however effective was just the kind of movie that those subversive scream flicks poked fun at then the deadly i still know what you did last summer deserves a full blown roasting on mystery science theatre 
house on haunted hill starring taye diggs geoffrey rush ali larter famke janssen peter gallagher bridgette wilson max perlich lisa loeb james marsters and chris kattan directed by william malone written by dick beebe house on haunted hill initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b horror flicks with grunting noises and cadaverous movements except this time at the end of the millenium the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be in past horror films the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims house on haunted hill doesn t want their audience to have an imagination everything is provided for them to watch and squirm not think this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film house on haunted hill which is based on the film of the same title introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can following the opening blood fest the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling unexpected shots of blood guts and mayhem however the film is neither scary nor unpredictable the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner geoffrey rush each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them the problem is that every character is not likable the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer taye diggs who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ali larter the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them the worst character in this film or maybe in any film released this year is chris kattan s watson pritchett he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself waiting for pritchett to die was a strenuously difficult act to sit through the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price an homage to victor price who starred in the original playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face however rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price played by famke janssen the main problem is that house on haunted hill is not scary to top off that huge disappointment every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped similar to deep blue sea the goal for creating a creepy suspenseful action film was completely missed 
okay bear with me y all cause first off i have to get this off my chest what the hell is up with that damn crab whew okay cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end as cute as the crab maybe even i know that you need more footage than that and that wasn t the only thing getting on my nerves the cutesy gimmicks saccharine sweet score soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar as amanda and sean patrick flannery as tom might have held some appeal during oh say the first minutes of the movie at first the movie moves along at a quick interesting pace it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just doesn t die a ridiculous concept yes but at this point i m willing to accept it because i m willing to accept that this is how amanda s life is changed how her powers are received later on the movie can t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying they weren t just repetitive they were out of place and unnecessary the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development amanda suddenly becoming a great chef her falling in love with tom etc sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good some places the plot just doesn t make sense sometimes it s way too contrived the crab bit for example and sometimes too corny peaches emitting dry ice can t beat that all in all the plot seemed fragmented unconnected not romantic at all and only funny in some places so okay do the magic powers come from the crab or the fairy godfather she can float now too and all of a sudden instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches she can put her emotions into her food tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda s witchcraft in the end would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac s video what the hell is up with that damn crab it is unfortunate because i liked the basic premise of the movie until it became too fantastical and tiresome the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least a theme for a while but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and minutes of people crying at their tables the humor was good in some places nolan gets the funniest bits including that incomprehensible totally random thing with the dolls gellar and flannery are qualified actors and gellar has a particular charm but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy or even annette in the upcoming cruel intentions than this sorry excuse for a character it s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible the supporting character nolan was a highlight though he reminded me a bit of kevin in you ve got mail see footnotes and as always typical of a chick flick romantic comedy there s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background cued up at all the right places this sort of got on the nerves after a while too simply irresistible is not hard to understand light funny in some places and generally disappointing because it can t draw the line between romance and protracted sap between humor and tired slapstick and how could i refrain from making a pun simply irresistible is all too easy to resist first viewing did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to you ve got mail or the shop around the corner business rivals fall in love female counterpart s business is in danger of being shut down female as mother like figure guiding her the annoying hysterical ex girlfriends i really like sarah michelle gellar s wardrobe 
ok i admit it i find camp amusement with the spice girls yes the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual identities they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of girl power but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn t enough to carry their big screen debut a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world the film begins amusingly enough with a cheeky esque title sequence in which the british quintet scary melanie brown baby emma bunton sporty melanie chisolm ginger geri halliwell and posh victoria adams are introduced one by one to much to my surprise excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience as they croon the silky ballad too much a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london s royal albert hall a film producer george wendt and a screenwriter mark mckinney pitch various film ideas to the girls manager clifford richard e grant a documentary film crew follows the girls a pregnant mate naoki mori of the group rapidly approaches her due date and a tabloid publisher barry humphries attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug richard o brien capped off by a live rendition of the girls bouncy hit say you ll be there a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow right wrong it s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them much less a organized framework for all the wacky goings on spice world jumps from vignette to vignette subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense at one minute having the girls meet with aliens no joke and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there during a dance bootcamp scene the girls sing the lyric we know how we got this far strength and courage and a wonderbra much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level some gags are just plain pointless such as roger moore s recurring role as the mysterious chief who dispenses cryptic metaphor heavy advice to clifford the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond ha ha as weak as the script is i think there s one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie and that is the girls themselves the point is not that they can t act and for the record they really can t but that their individual personas which works as a gimmick over the span of a four minute music video are too thin to survive outside of the truncated video bite mtv world posh who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions comes off best by default because her persona rich bitch most easily translates into character in a film baby s persona young innocent to a lesser extent also works but the remaining girls identities are a little harder to flesh out there really isn t much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often which is exactly what fuller and spiers do and after all what exactly entails being ginger or scary apparently just their wardrobes spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices signature hit wannabe the song is as grating as ever but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much needed shot in the arm setting the stage for a wave of self referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters film ideas the film almost mirrors robert altman s the player in the way the film snails into itself this section of the film involving all manner of derring do involving a speeding bus is perhaps its most effective but it also points up how all the other storylines the publisher the documentary crew lack a satisfactory payoff spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family and it will please the spice faithful but this sloppy enterprise surely won t win them any new fans which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states once the hype disappears spice world will likely serve as the the spices final hurrah in america 
the last of vampire films offers plenty of blood and gore but beyond that nothing jack crow james woods is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican his and his men s mission is to clean the earth from vampires they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered but one has always escaped them valek thomas ian griffith the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation the black cross with the cross in their possesion the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth i have never liked john carpenter and his style after seeing this film my opinions have not changed john carpenter remains john carpenter however because of the film s self irony black humour and fascinating cinematography i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long long time neither the synopses or carpenter s direction are original but there are some things that are interesting the director s negative view on the catholic church for instance at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba maximilian schell has simply used crow and his team to find valek so that he would gain eternal life otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool drinking smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere set in new mexican dessert he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness more than anything in this film this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil the cinematography by gary b kibbe is probably the film s greatest achievement music composed by john carpenter himself is at times effective the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice when it comes to the cast in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem everyone can scream and swing the axe but here james woods is suprisingly convincing he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter who lost his family to the breed of evil woods is constantly overacting which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow s loyal partner the other cast members are struggling because the film doesn t take itself too seriously it stays afloat still it is like most vampire films a mediocre experience 
confucius once said governing a nation is like cooking a small fish don t overdo it his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make granted mike judge writer director of the workplace satire office space isn t exactly an amateur his most infamous work the mtv series beavis and butt head was pure gold for its network but unfailingly judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground the iffiness in judge s plot a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss is not in its appeal in fact based on the popularity of scott adams cartoon dilbert which will soon have its own television series a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit length sequences which would be more at home on the set of saturday night live rather than a full length feature the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space which feature almost all of the movie s top content this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated other evidence of office space s failure to work are its lack of good jokes the comedy is marginally funny at best but not enough to get a packed house of theater goers to laugh out loud the material in the movie is on key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting and this could partially explain his work here however the movie is loaded with too many misfires including the token plot to allow for any excuse the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers headed up by peter gibbons ron livingston at a company named initech after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech the movie introduces us to two consultants john c mcginley and paul willson which are in charge of downsizing the company s payroll when peter and his gang learns of this as well as the reason behind it so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh gary cole s stock will go up they set about creating a plan to see his downfall the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston as love interest subplot are all that keep this one together but it s definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent

when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie however since this film also featured michael madsen more than capable character actor this time in the role of protagonist the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt however the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials madsen plays richard montana tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio played by lynch however the raid was only partially successful and montana is getting the rap so he begins his own private war against gio trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt in the process he meets gio s mistress gina zamora played by rosie vela and starts relationship with her too although it doesn t stink like many of the similar films can inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine nobody in this film actually puts much effort including madsen or lynch and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela who apart from showing her more than impressive looks shows some of the singing talent too however this isn t reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would in most likelihood forget the next day 
five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king s writings called the shawshank redemption writer director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king unlike the latter film this one is a big long laborious bore plot a seven foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers critique this film is slow drawn out boring uninteresting unexciting predictable and topped with a couple of one dimensional evil characters its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about of course much like all other death row cell blocks this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be misunderstood except for one cookie cutter crazy guy who is evil personified and let s not forget all the guards on death row who also happen to be angels from the heaven above except for one cookie cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film or even more importantly am i supposed to give a rat s ass about anyone in this film well if i was i sure missed that boat because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin furthermore there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone s life to present this story in fact the story is empty within itself i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not wow how interesting the plot s utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie whip out those thinking caps kids hmmm and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie cutter evil guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity hmmmm now think hard here boys and girls what a crock i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three hour exercise in spirituality but unfortunately for me it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging in fact it was one big bore i didn t see the point of the movie i didn t see the point of the story and i certainly didn t see the point in tom hanks big double chin all in all a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour john coffey give that man an award or something 
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen last man standing is either a a prohibition era remake of akira kurosawa s classic yojimbo b a prohibition era remake of sergio leone s classic a fistful of dollars c a prohibition era action drama with a completely original story line new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category c than in the other two combined much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the real source material the dashiell hammett novel red harvest it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself this time around the man with no name is played by bruce willis a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico by all appearances jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border one is headed by an irishman named doyle david patrick kelly the other is run by chicago connected italian mobster strozzi ned eisenberg calling himself john smith the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle s side but smith s allegiance is as uncertain as his name and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes cum bastardizations there is the happily ineffectual lawman bruce dern the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections karina lombard the barkeep who becomes our anti hero s only friend william sanderson suspicious lieutenants christopher walken and michael imperioli to question the bosses trust in smith a brutal beating and a big fire director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity but at least he doesn t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture what he does do is nearly as big a mistake and that is to provide a running voice over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard boiled style of pulp detective fiction yes that narration is full of cliches but those are are not particularly troubling the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters they were a mystery to the other characters in the film and to the audience their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status with john smith s voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought he becomes more mundane just another tough guy trying to stay alive it feels like a hammett novel all right and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice but it simply doesn t work the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence and the man with no name takes no one into his confidence even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate i can t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else christopher walken plays doyle s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft spoken psychos and there isn t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression with no compelling antagonist for smith there is no build up towards the expected showdown and when it does come that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about cinematographer lloyd ahern who also did the only noteworthy work on hill s flop wild bill creates some nifty sunburned vistas but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter productive narration sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original they ll wonder what all the talk was about in the case of last man standing it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about 
robin williams this time without a beard returns to drama in this sloppy sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects he plays chris nielsen who meets annie annabella sciora and promptly marries her they have two great kids who sadly die in a car crash just when it couldn t get any worse chris gets killed in a car crash and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert gooding jnr annie can t take the grief anymore and kills herself all sounding like good fun so far the penalty for suicide is to go to hell and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller max von sydow based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson what dreams may come is clunky manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made everything is wrong about this movie the performances are forced and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters williams puts on a convincing upset face but that s all it is a face there s no emotion behind it sciora s performance is lazy and bogs down the whole film she may look pretty but she can t act max von sydow is o k as the traveller if nothing special cuba gooding jnr thankfully adds some bounce to his performance and is certainly the best performer in the film it s a shame that his character is so flat and d and offers no room for improvement all the performers have to work with a soppy script that tries it s best to get some emotion going but never takes off the ground there are some scenes which could be real heartwarmers but the faceless characters don t help to get anything out of the performers while films like e t used great actors music and direction to pull of a masterful heart tugging scene what dreams may come is haphazard expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically instead it s all rather boring sure the music is pretty by michael kamen and the cinematography isn t bad by eduardo serra but there s something lacking the script doesn t help filled with hopeless romantic clich s and dud speeches richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin let alone being converted into a million vehicle for robin williams despite being set in heaven what dreams may come is mightily depressing the film rushes a happy ending but everything before this is very very sad and black which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid but there s one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie the special effects heaven and hell are truly incredible places and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets but despite this what dreams may come proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of instead of raising questions about existence it raises boredom sadly i recommend you give this film a miss better luck next time robin a david wilcock review you know for kids norville barnes 
possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk it smashed u s box office office records in it s opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here but is it any good in a word no i ll elaborate further the story is as follows apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened see jurrasic park imgen the company that funded jurrasic park want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago realizing what a bad idea this is proffessor john hammond richard attenborough decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs so as to rally public support to preserve the island enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there so basically what you have is this two teams one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other trying to document them being forced to work together fighting for survival against the dinosaurs firm intentions on eating them a fairly good idea however it s let down by one slight problem it s crap over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring way too quiclky add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like what s for tea and should you cut the lawn later yes you should it s a shame then really that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c g i dinosaurs the t rex s have to be seen to be believed there is nothing else to recommend the lost world a very dissapointing sequel indeed 
the second serial killer thriller of the month is just awful oh it starts deceptively okay with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work after a baby sitter gets gutted in the suit ably spooky someone s in the house prologue parallel stories unfold the first involving a texas sheriff r lee emery a gruesome double murder and the arrival of a morose fbi agent dennis quaid on the eve of voting for the local lawman s reelection the second pairs a hitch hiker jared leto with a friendly former railroad worker danny glover they re headed west toward the rockies and away from the murder scene which one is the killer well it doesn t really matter cause when writer first time director jeb stuart die hard finally spills the beans you won t take his choice seriously anyway the whole thing goes south about an hour in with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn t follow and through the whole thing there s quaid playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea gal i guess i m glad that i didn t walk out there s some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr strangelove 
in the james bond film diamonds are forever tiffany case asks whether he prefers brunettes to redheads bond s response is that it doesn t really matter as long as collars and cuffs match well collars and cuffs don t match in the real blonde what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny meandering comedy on screen the film supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business is wafer thin it plays like an ally mcbeal episode dragged out to the nth degree replete with a few unnecessary fantasy sequences writer director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea it isn t the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary matthew modine plays joe a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent he s with no agent and no credits since he s too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas that s not really acting he tells his girlfriend of six years mary catherine keener with whom he bickers constantly about sex but they need the money so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video but it s not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike played by elizabeth berkley still trying to jump start her career after showgirls this points out how artificial this whole business is one supposes dicillo has referred to the real blonde as off kilter but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff the film which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere is remarkably on kilter and with perhaps the single exception of the always likable modine who s not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks the entire cast is vague and uninteresting catherine keener who s appeared in dicillo s previous three films including the brilliant living in oblivion is at her most annoying in the real blonde look at her closely she really can t act at all her reactions are all wrong almost always out of sync with her co stars she reacts too soon or too late to lines and situations she moves her eyes or her mouth far too much she frowns she yells she babbles she blows chunks maxwell caulfield plays joe s actor waiter buddy bob the one obsessed with dating a natural blonde bob s personality not to mention caulfield s acting ability parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera passion crest stiff and uninteresting maybe that s the point daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title a soap dish who beds bob both on and off camera hannah looks about fifty in this movie she s only why is that almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples why is that marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer and so on the best parts of the the real blonde are the beginning and the end brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog there s more depth and sincerity in a single close up of her expressive face than in the entire film while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it s funny 
another formula feel good quirky comedy from the british isles much like waking ned devine and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town such as tolerant vicars and policemen plenty of eccentrics and of locals who stick together through thick and thin the strength of this film lies in its rational theme that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol the film is tolerable until after its first hour it then falls completely apart becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to at least be viewed as containing a pertinent message its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the war on drugs is about to be escalated into colombia the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future it has so far just ended up causing america s jails to be overcrowded with non violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america s drug usage and drug supply billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war by backing a corrupt government remember vietnam with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam with this scenario closer to home so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war the film s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public something that should have been accepted some years ago is a theme long overdue for public acceptance but one that is better received late than never there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this rather than making it a police matter altogether the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle aged woman grace brenda blethyn who fell out of an airplane evidently committing suicide the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up without her knowledge their comfortable year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london honey quick what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying is that when conferring with honey she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can the creditors swoop down on her like vultures her gardener and handyman matthew ferguson decides to stay on with her despite his last check bouncing since she is an expert amateur horticulturist he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants which he grows for private use the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high quality stuff for grace this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt for the scotsman matthew it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky valerie the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed the police sergeant campbell pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace s greenhouse is for the friendly vicar phillips counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can t control and the doctor clunes enjoys smoking the weed for recreation the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big time drug dealer instead of having matthew go because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn t want matthew to end up in jail it is interesting to note that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you only that one can go to jail the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london trying to find a drug dealer while dressed out of place in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole whereby it never recovered its dignity the film moves into the formula mode whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive as she meets an international drug dealer a frenchman tcheky karyo who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences thereby becoming a celebrity things work out in a ridiculous way where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded this unhip film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly but should be tolerated as something naughty middle aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute ummm 
cradle will rock is the latest effort from director actor tim robbins while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in dead man walking he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here the story is confusing and filled with many subplots so i ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible the film is based on a mostly true story about a federal theater in the s that produced a play the cradle will rock that apparently was offensive to some so the government shuts it down it s during the time of the depression and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs or are poor between this conflict lies what seems like subplots about those who work in theater or those associated also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience tim robbin s just keeps piling on political views and characters that we just give up on the film or in some cases walk out for robbin s it may be a nice achievement but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue and fancy outfits i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast unfortunately are all uninteresting except for a few let me recap what each important character does so please bear with me it s the least you can do especially if you were considering seeing this i ll begin with those involved with the play there s orson welles angus macfadyen who of course is the director of the play the producer john houseman cary elwes marc blitzstein hank azaria the writer of the play emily watson a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock outside the play there s the ventriloquist bill murray who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk joan cusack another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ruben blades who s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage john cusack there s a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories susan sarandon philip baker hall too name a few but those that i mentioned were the most significant to the story anyway most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted except for emily watson who does another great job and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack who always delivers through thick and thin now although most of the film was weak to say the least there were some nice moments and some involving subjects but all this is overblown sure the free speech segment was a nice feature but not when it becomes repetitive the whole film is like this and it s basically nothing but a headache on the brighter side tim robbin s direction was masterful his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson s latest magnolia only smoother in my opinion but even that can t make a movie that much better although it has it s moments not many of them but they re there cradle will rock stays true to it s title because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over 
if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films i might say that i review movies that don t look particularly good because i m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it if that were true i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads shay casey seeing bad movies so you don t have to but i know that s bunk you re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say so i have to tell the truth every once in a while i get a nasty masochistic urge to see a bad movie you know the feeling when you re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly sometimes i think that s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies ever admit it sometimes you like seeing bad movies so do i so i saw supernova truth be told supernova wasn t quite as bad as i thought it might be maybe i just felt sorry for the actors or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn t started tinkering with the director s walter hill final cut causing him to want his name removed maybe i m becoming a softy in any case i didn t find supernova as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe but it s still bad the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale the crew includes captain a j marley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz there are some attempts at characterization but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction which puts kaela on edge yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy faces at each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay is in love with the computer apparently female don t expect any more explanation because you won t get it anyway the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent during the dimension jump i think that s what it s called but don t hold me to it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board he calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening have you seen alien have you seen event horizon a lame movie in its own right good then you ve seen supernova post production cuts or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either after all no one s going to think for a second that troy won t turn out to be a villain but the bigger problem with supernova is that it can t just stick to the simple plot it s afforded numerous re writes the script may be credited to three people but it s a gross underestimate have crammed this lean minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot did the ship s computer learn something about humanity what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him and just what does the film s title signify if anything as far as i can tell it refers to a very small plot detail that isn t developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements character relationships in this film also make very little sense for some reason every person in this film keeps having sex we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first minutes bassett and spader s characters start off hating each other fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later they re engaging in some hanky panky when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship of course both female crew members will fall in love with him every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut the most prominent example however may be the fact that when the film starts there are no opening credits furthermore the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits maybe that s why the film s title is mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you re seeing lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene with little to no introduction to any of the characters or situations the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point a to point b point a danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby point b tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing doesn t make sense since i didn t understand anything about these characters motivations did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one by one and he does knocking off three of them in about minutes not a whit it s a shame because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do they don t find it bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces sexual tension more like constipation maybe they re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice not that we ever find out who that is mind you the climax of their relationship taking place in a transport pod is probably the film s biggest forehead slapper as troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected he s awfully one note but it s not as if he s given any more notes to work with the rest of the cast does even less tunney stands around looking cute then scared phillips broods cruz flirts with the computer then they all die and a star blows up or something but i really wasn t paying much attention by then supernova is pretty awful but i m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got that s it if you expect it to be good for whatever reasons you may have you ll probably hate it more than i will even the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven t seen before and suffice to say the script isn t going to save the film honestly though what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym it usually results in a bad movie and that s what supernova is 
a follow up to disney s live action dalmatians that s better more entertaining than the first just as unlikely with dalmatians the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs more is definitely not the merrier s dalmatians certainly wasn t the greatest movie going experience of all time but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous larger than life performance in addition we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen and close s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the year old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers but that s only half the problem with kevin lima s laborious film what makes dalmatians such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor here almost single handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he s a dog voiced by eric idle its rabid plotlessness cruella goes after puppies again winds up in goo again and most of all the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic heroes of the piece a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander than bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo gruffudd is cute and harmless perhaps but evans can t even aspire to that the dogs upstage them both of course but in the case of evans even close s split ends are more animated bad acting however seems to be a requirement for this sequel since g rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro s in men of honor jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu s over the top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail and wail for wail france s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself and in dalmatians the producers milk that realization for all it s worth le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as poopies par example and ad nauseum the finesses of the script attributed to four screenwriters no less and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up are quickly dispensed with since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben that done it s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown the dogs are pretty cute try making a puppy look otherwise but that s pretty much all they are there s always the feeling that there s a trainer off in the wings coaxing the dogs to open doors or pick up their food bowls in unison or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder savvy holiday goers should skip dalmatians and pop the original animated classic into their vcrs instead it s one dalmatian less but more satisfying 
underwater science fiction stays submerged sphere a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered psychologist norman goodman dustin hoffman is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash when he arrives at the site he discovers that there is no plane but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting feet below the surface for almost years having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship his group as outlined in his report consists of beth halperin sharon stone a biochemist harry adams samuel l jackson a mathematician and ted fielding liev schreiber an astrophysicist unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then colleagues to the team after all he explains who reads government documents lead by harold barnes peter coyote a top secret federal operative the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel once there they stroll over knock on the door and explore the still operational ufo discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere when adams enters the sphere the weirdness unfolds a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer my name is jerry i am happy flashes across the screen this is unsettling for the psychologist what happens if jerry gets mad he asks barnes is more pragmatic he needs a last name because he can t put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry then the situation turns bad deadly beasts appear from nowhere a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel lethal sea snakes attack goodman a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading leagues under the sea the suspicious scientists turn against each other this has all the makings of a first rate thinking man s science fiction film however even the finest ingredients don t go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn t seem to care about his product director barry levinson has churned out a mish mosh that doesn t engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification it s much like speed reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances it doesn t get any better when the action scenes begin while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles the people are still flat oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them after adams experiences the interior of the sphere no one bothers to ask him what happened their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited even goodman and halperin s ill conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing there s a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending but here they are far too obvious when an emergency mini sub is explained you know what s going to happen the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting chapter headings that divide the movie have no function the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable a great deal of it isn t even a science fiction film must be internally consistent there s too much here that doesn t make sense are the manifestations real the jellyfish kill queen latifa in a throw away role and the squid nearly destroys the outpost but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect a scene in the sub suggests that it s illusion but earlier episodes indicate that it s not not everything has to be explained to death but there are major questions that the film never answers where the ship came from is clarified but how it ended up on the ocean floor in is merely alluded to even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll the climax is followed by minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale after pre release audience testing the actors were called back to re shoot the ending it s difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse following the recent tradition of lengthy films this weighs in at over two very long hours the weak scenes could have been cut but then there wouldn t have been much left the movie was supposedly held up by effects work but there s nothing special on the screen we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm stealing from alien the abyss and the disastrous event horizon this film has learned nothing from them remarkably levinson and hoffman s other currently showing film is wag the dog a smart and entertaining piece of work this one could have been titled the same sans one word 
 houston we have a serious problem after making mission impossible brian de palma has a lot to live up to by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew he hopes to reach the modern audience and the possibilities are certainly there but the result is a great disaster starting in a near future with a prologue copied from apollo de palma slowly builds up his story the human race has already set foot on mars a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened this is basically the whole plot so it s hard to imagine that it can be stretched to hours but de palma manages to do that it is not a very good achievement as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space the hardest thing to do is stay awake the film s major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is david mamet s dialogue while trying to seem natural is distant and simply fake de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick s a space odyssey apollo and godzilla to make time pass the creators have inserted several refreshing scientific details that would not convince a half crazed frog it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp offs from several great science fiction films and stories when it finally presents an almost original idea it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity i can t even call this film predictable since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this sometimes it gets so cheesy that you ll start laughing when you re supposed to cry and cry when you re supposed to laugh you ll see enormous sandstorms hear mysterious sounds and last but not least on this constantly surprising tour you ll see an alien it s really hard to find comparisons to such an experience and i know that i ve never said that before i thought i never would but lost in space is actually better that s an achievement in itself director brian de palma has stroke gold with untouchables that became an instant american classic it is for this film that he will be remembered while all his other failures will be forgotten he ll live to fight another day i send the actors my condolences since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters and both the cinematography production design and art direction are very decent it is because of the achievement of people that i rate this film unfortunately their hard work was in vain if you have problems with insomnia i recommend you this film if you re not asleep within the first half hour consult your doctor 
porter stoddard warren beatty is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie diane keaton for twenty five years they and best friends mona goldie hawn and griffin garry shandling are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen town and country town and country has a pedigree befitting it s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry the graduate under the direction of peter chelsom funny bones after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates the media has been prepped for beatty s next ishtar so is it that bad the answer is no but it s not very good either the major problem with town and country is that it s unstructured and random stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer having just bedded a flaky cellist nastassja kinski next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings buck henry cameos as both couples divorce lawyer ellie thinks she s overeacting but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family s mississippi manse the two childhood friends end up in bed together making us wonder why they d never become a couple to begin with back home their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter s cheating on her porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he s gay the four friends along with every woman porter s dallied with all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after although the film begins promisingly resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps too many strands drift off into nowhere the stoddard household is huge containing two adult children josh hartnett the virgin suicides and tricia vessey kiss the girls their colorful bedmates and a maid who s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack the six supporting players are dropped except for an out of nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son porter s romantic misadventures with women other than mona are equally mishandled once the marital discord begins the film seems as if it was editted with a machete stopping and starting never regaining its rhythm while beatty gets off a few tart observations his character is mostly passive and bemused maybe we re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn t initiate his own sex romps keaton s ellie has a trusting nature that s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of the out of towners and the first wives club while shandling s relegated to true second banana status kinski is bland and unmotivated andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay s most bizarre subplot which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic wheelchair bound foul mouthed mother heston and seldes are fun as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like hear my song and funny bones the script is this film s weakest link it s telling that most of the few laughs come from old fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit while town and country isn t exactly painful to sit through it mostly just lays there 
can you say dated you can if you ve seen rosemary s baby which like the exorcist was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release mystery science theater has skewered the bad films of the past but let me tell you it could do a number on the good ones too rosemary s baby stars mia farrow from the time she was actually good looking as an innocent housewife and her not so innocent husband john cassavettes an actor who takes an easy albeit evil road to success it all seems so harmless in the beginning mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed there s also a skull in the living room but it s only for decoration their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming all s well for about the first hour of this slow moving film until mia eats some of the neighbors chocolate mousse and passes out when she comes to she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big evil man raping her a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen it seems like a dream and when she finds herself pregnant she almost forgets about it and everyone s helping with the pregnancy the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink a good luck charm for her to wear around her neck and the name of an obstetrician who s been in the business years meanwhile mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries that s when you know your health s failing the only person in the movie who s the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend maurice evans who calls mia up to give her the bad news and immediately falls into a coma by about the two hour mark i felt the same way rosemary s baby is way too long and leads up to a payoff that s about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie i guess someone put a spell on this movie 
in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa the twilight murders another one from the series is dealing with the case of gordon kahl played by rod steiger old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u s government after being released he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest when the u s marshals come to arrest him it turns out that kahl isn t alone many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti government beliefs and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that that brings fbi on the scene and agent mayberly michael gross is supervising the manhunt however his efforts seem fruitless since kahl still has many supporters some of them even in the local law enforcement after betrayed thriller by costa gavras hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right wing extremism in the american northwest and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing when media hype brought right wingers back into spotlight until that time only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon unfortunately the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script sometimes like many american tv movies it creates drama where drama shouldn t be on the other hand film is steadily directed by dick lowry and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl on the other hand michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible however film does deal with potentially thought provoking social and political issues so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn t be the total waste of time 
the cartoon is way better that s the bottom line on disney s incredibly hyped live action version of its animated feature the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic home alone with puppies and not much else when production of this remake was announced the big question seemed to be why the original cartoon still works so what s the point the answer it appears is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign the story for those of you who missed childhood is simple two dalmatians pongo and perdy fall in love at first sight they drag their human pets together and in a short time both couples marry the heavenly match ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy s new born pups are stolen their dog napping engineered by the evil cruella devil who wants them for their pelts everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies in the original movie the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities we also could hear them talk which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film the dog s view of humans as their pets in the new version the dogs are mute and expressionless hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks while he drew the desired aww they re so cute reaction from the audience it was quickly followed by several people whispering i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog s heads to get them licking like that the canines lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles in previous films daniels successfully played off his white bread persona in something wild he revealed the rebellious thrill seeker beneath his neutral demeanor in terms of endearment his hapless appearance masked a cold manipulative womanizer here he and richardson are so consistently bland that it s a wonder their images even stick to the film glenn close however has no problems establishing a distinct personality as the villainous icon cruella devil she tears up the screen in a deliciously over the top performance close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself with a two tone fright wig red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature she s clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon and her wicked glee is infectious when she spits out lines like you ve won the battle but i m about to win the wardrobe the film comes briefly to life dalmatians is crammed with john hughes typical heavy handed approach to comedy after an ingenuous opening showing pongo s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park a little slapstick goes a long way but hughes just keeps laying it on the second half of the film where local animals team up to rescue nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen is a tedious home alone clone with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy scratchy cartoon including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence dalmatians has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick bland characters and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high fiving one another rent the cartoon 
in the first death wish movie mild mannered new york architect paul kersey played by charles bronson was avenging the death of his wife in the second he was avenging his daughter in the third he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend fourth movie on the other hand begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen played by kay lenz however since this is death wish movie we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for this time karen s teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways kersey s new targets unlike the previous movies aren t the ordinary street punks but rich heavily armed and well connected drug dealers even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support and it comes from the publisher nathan white john p ryan determined to avenge the drug related death of his own daughter white s plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them the plan begins to take shape but kersey s actions bring attention of two police detectives reiner george dickerson and nozaki soon teck oh fourth and unfortunately not the final installment in the death wish series will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade however although some critics might argue death wish the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish paul kersey one of the most intriguing and potentially controversial characters of the s is still being dumbed down by mediocre script and charles bronson really doesn t feel the need to put much effort in his acting however the hand of a veteran director j lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner s and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end the script even tries to fake some social conscience through criminally underused kay lenz s character and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years there are even some half hearted attempts of humour both intentional and unintentional like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson s s classics special note to x philes mith pilleggi the actor who plays ad skinner in the x files could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman 
every now and then reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact either good or bad that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings but sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review the impression left by the film wasn t overwhelming on the contrary there were hardly any impression at all since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it which surprise me to this day because the movie theatre was full i was close to sound speakers the show wasn t late and i didn t lack sleep before the show such things happen very rarely to me and after many years the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters old peter brackett nick nolte and young aspiring sabrina peterson julia roberts two of them are assigned to cover the train collision as soon as they meet they start scooping each other but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk and also the romantic feelings they have for each other the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d tre romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn movie author director and screenwriter charles shyer who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride tries again this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts however although there is some chemistry between the two soon it stops to arouse any interest it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix that collides light hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two and fails in both areas making the story cliched and predictable the end result is rather forgettable effort which convinced me not to watch movie again i ll give it the benefit of the doubt though 
american pie is filled with laughs but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater i m no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the hit comedy but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself what separates american pie from its predecessor is heart of the original i noted it was a warm pleasant outing about the travails of growing up well the quartet of chums jim jason biggs oz chris klein kevin thomas ian nicholas and finch eddie kaye thomas have grown up at least they are a year older but don t seem any wiser fresh from their first year of college the quartet along with the obnoxious stifler seann william scott rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score as usual nothing goes right until the last reel but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women and american pie is rather degrading to women for the most part they are not shown as individuals they are nothing more than potential recipients of over active raging hormones it is telling that the most normal couple oz and heather mena suvari spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex she s overseas on an exchange student program despite having been to college jim is still klutzy and awkward unsure of himself around the opposite sex most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him including a painful episode involving an instant glue like substance also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates whom the boys suspect of being lesbians it is offensive and plays upon outdated adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs the first film despite some raunchy moments had an innocent charm to it the sequel is more cynical it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them the many mentions of finch s encounter with stifler s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy s return as jim s well meaning trying to be hip dad the only performer who is actually given some new fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle the band geek from the original in the sequel she imbues her character with vulnerability wisdom and maturity american pie is a pre sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office it is a shame though that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz who also penned the original could not have set his sights higher american pie is funny but it s still a comedown as well as a letdown 
 dreamworks skg running time hours starring robert duvall tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year the second is the macho armageddon is actually a dull affair elijah wood plays leo biederman who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth tea leoni plays a rather crap news reporter jenny lerner who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew spurgeon tanner who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth also featuring is morgan freeman as the president and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny s father and mother while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up as the trailers seem to promise the film is actually more of a character study if a very poor one the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film and not enough time to explore them all only the space crew are given any depth jenny lerner leo and the president are surprisingly d and we never get to know these characters and because i couldn t care for them i didn t really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple and never really makes any interesting statements mimi leder the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker again directs in a ho hum style and never really gets any emotion out of a scene which is a shame the cast are seemingly on autopilot although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role he just seems to be in this film for the money elijah wood one of the best child actors working today is surprisingly average although his choice of roles lately haven t exactly been brilliant i e flipper his role is also vastly underwritten morgan freeman again is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role like duvall he just seems to be in the film for the money the supporting cast are all o k none making much of an impression ok so deep impact may have messed up character wise but surely the special effects are good well yes and no although the special effects should be impressive with a massive tidal wave destroying new york the special effects look like well special effects sadly the waves looks like it s been drawn on computer and doesn t look too good at all surprising really when the effects are done by industrial light magic who did the effects for the lost world and twister in the end deep impact is a wasted opportunity what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects the hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect once again dreamworks has churned out another average movie let s hope armageddon is a bit better overall rating review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their science fiction flick species squandering an intriguing premise the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success raking in over million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ben kingsley s a splendid actor but a marquee name he ain t miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film i doubted that they d dare tempt fate and go for another round so here comes species ii with a new creative team director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman respectively that fails to improve the series one iota like its predecessor species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid the film follows the exploits of a young man patrick ross justin lazard whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women loitering in strip clubs and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can in other words patrick is like a lot of guys these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age but there s a catch he s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars and who s now infected with alien dna patrick s overriding compulsion to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring and when he becomes aware of eve natasha henstridge a half human half alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab patrick s primary focus turns to her if these two were to mate the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable warns dr laura baker marg helgenberger gamely reprising her role with admirable conviction species ii opens with the mars mission and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey looking even splicing back to dated grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities they really skimped on production values this time around however this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b movie is quickly answered mr brancato s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches like the first film and perhaps in homage to it there s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room something bad happened here this time laura gets to stand over a fresh shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter this is awful and she s not even empathic and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully paced suspense sequence eve who s telepathically linked to her alien human hybrid counterpart whatever helpfully tells our alien hunting protagonists he s going to rape her while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own there s an amusing tongue in cheek bit of product placement which doesn t really make much sense but i appreciated the sentiment as well as some supermarket related hijinx he s in aisle informs eve if the film maintained this sort of light hearted tone it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch but to its detriment it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody effects ladened anticlimactic conclusion much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense and there are such gaping plot holes that it s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief the implausibilities are endless what about the toxic bomb in eve s brain why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual my favourite was the slow motion sequence in the film where eve sporting superhuman strength is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief incredulous that it s being foisted upon the public returning headlines michael madsen who reprises tough guy press lennox and ms helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay but there s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis mykelti williamson portraying astronaut dennis gamble churns out an all too familiar spin on a generic brash mouthed character and fine character actors george dzundza playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process and james cromwell patrick s neglectful father senator ross are utterly wasted in the film mr lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty eyed look while returning vixen ms henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene and acquits herself nicely but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing or none at all ms henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series claiming that she s so empowered a lethal half alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion now that s what i call empowerment 
how could a g rated disney film based on meg cabot s novel the princess diaries be anything but cute harmless fun easy take all the cute harmless fun out of it and while you re at it make it borrr ring that s what director garry marshall screenwriter gina wendkos and not to be outdone producer whitney houston have done with the g rated disney film the princess diaries you couldn t tell it from the audience though a braintree mass of growing glowing pre pubescent girls and the odd parental popcorn perched about their persons who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy duddy old me well i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over but that would have been too obvious too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall s film garry made a couple of other princess movies pretty woman and runaway bride but this one s way without julia roberts so maybe that s its problem in addition to being predictable as molasses the princess diaries has hardly got a laugh in it it s a comedy could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long long stretches and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven t even seen yet and probably never will except perhaps in the dvd edition marshall should take virtually all of the blame here since he s been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isn t working and hardly any of the princess diaries works works alas implies cleverness and there s none of that here either newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of the filmmakers go out of their way not to call it serbia which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words and now she mia is next in line to rule genovia hence the headphones tiara combo in the print ads julie andrews with the luminous factor cranked to plays mia s grandmother aka queen clarisse renaldi who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating talking and looking like a princess department although mia s big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh not really consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock an evil cheerleader a dorky looking best friend welcome to the dollhouse s heather matarazzo a sensitive auto mechanic musician and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia s chauffeur driven limousine at every intersection a non animated g rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts all the good stuff has been exorcised from the finished product lame labored and lamentable the princess diaries is recommended for eight and a half year olds of the feminine persuasion only all others would do well to avoid it like potholes the plague and the perfect storm 
remember tom cruise and brian brown as rival bartenders juggling bottles of booze in cocktail remember how stupid that looked and remember the scantily clad dancers of flashdance getting doused with buckets of water well coyote ugly does those films five better or six better if you count john goodman since here we have piper perado maria bello tyra banks melanie lynskey and izabella miko doing the absolut spinning and jiggling thing while pouring pitchers of perrier all over their semi naked torsos no goodman doesn t flip jim beams or wear anything particularly risqu in the film but he does get up on the bar and start gyrating with the rest of them and the central character s love interest played by an australian actor named adam garcia proves he can get up on that bar and start shimmying along with the rest of them too what seems to have started life as a victoria s secret photo shoot quickly deteriorates into one heck of an embarrassing movie violet perado is a south amboy hopeful who tries to make it big as a songwriter not a welder in new jack city as na ve as they come she s fobbed off by music producer s receptionists by the scorn ful and has her apartment robbed hours after touching down in chinatown and like her mother before her she gets stage fright whenever she tries to do the open mike night thing when she sees a trio of babe a licious barkeeps thumbing through a stack of s in an all night diner violet simply has to check out this bar they call coyote ugly lil bello the no nonsense owner agrees to give violet an audition but violet blows it still lil gives violet another chance a riot breaks out riots are the order of the day at ugly s since the staff are relentless in flaunting their sexual wares flambeeing the bar and soaking the patrons with diet sprite this is certifiable behavior in case i didn t mention it but violet successfully subdues the crowd by singing along to blondie s one way or another on the jukebox she s hired and cured since this little episode gives her the confidence to sing in an amateur talent contest where her dad goodman the junk food eating laundry impaired toll collector comes to see her and is as proud as punch the end 
what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life you get martin lawrence in a coma the comedian thought he was getting fat so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in degree heat ending up in a coma so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies you get an audience in a coma in big momma s house lawrence plays a fbi agent who s a master of disguises when a naughty naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend the very sexy nia long the only thing worth looking at in this movie she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt big momma ella mitchell the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail however big momma is called away on an emergency sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal lawrence goes undercover as big momma and let the comedy begin big momma s house is the definition of a gimmick movie if there ever was one the plot can basically be summed up as martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman and even that description is too wordy you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin lawrence fat woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it and all sorts of clich d humorous situations pointing to it fat woman plays basketball fat woman takes a dump fat woman kung fu well they left one off the board movie critic slips into coma paul giamatti private parts the negotiator plays lawrence s partner and as much as i enjoy his work even he can t inject life into this lifeless comedy hell the greatest performers on the planet couldn t make this material work it s just that awful 
it rocks actually lots of rocks fly at us or from us in slow or fast motion at several points in the film they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward and when they land once in a while when we need a break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon a steroid user s answer to deep impact bruce willis stars as harry stamper a famed oil driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet why an oil driller they require someone experience with deep core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid in one unintentionally hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect a deep core driller they built based on his blueprints it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it we trust nasa to build space shuttles harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including a blond guy a fat guy a black guy a wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes whether or not they save the day i will not reveal nor will you care i will say this you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope willis has barely a chance to come alive ditto for affleck their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in a last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material steve buscemi s character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic rockhound as he s called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to a chair where he spends most of the film so why did they bring him up there to begin with rather why write him into the film give his almost witty one liners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig i m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is blue liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her father s band s aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie on screen the middle hour is a non sensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primate s brain whenever someone dies in this movie a crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead person s last name here i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil guy cum astronaut from a live one and close ups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla it looks nicer and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework it has a vivid soundmix but at almost two and a half hours i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever bollocks the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon crawler remember a little film called jaws in this film three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark they didn t much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another one of jaws great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances i d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don t bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest beating bravery to this i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldn t build a birdhouse and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer a trailer for a movie written by a team of body builders and greeting card authors i ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life 
wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles murder at u s marshals money train drop zone boiling point and the ultimate camp film passenger the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category ultimately it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe and terrible acting by b list actors like michael biehn and anne archer oddly it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes masterpiece rising sun the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador the chinese triad brotherhood a rich chinese businessman played by that bad guy from rising sun cary hiroyuki tagawa a chinese un interpreter and inexplicably donald sutherland the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo s hong kong films combined i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film i usually enjoy snipes movies though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films simply i am amazed by the how inane the script was filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences director christian duguay screamers has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts showing splattering brains people impaled with broken shards of glass and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere it also sickens me to know that oliver stone one of the greatest directors working today had his hand in producing this monstrosity i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script watch the dailies be involved in casting or anything else or else he d be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits it s also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese i m sure over the next couple of months even more chinese conspiracy martial arts action flicks are going to be popping up in your local multiplex hopefully they won t include wesley snipes 
adam sandler vehicles are never anything special but continue to make a load of money which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today while good comedies like rushmore to choose a recent example gets limited release and doesn t make a lot of money big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash it s also nothing special and doesn t deserve the money it s making but i digress sandler plays sonny koufax a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him either wise up and get responsible or she s leaving him by a strange set of events koufax ends up with julian played by twins cole and dylan sprouse a five year old kid after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child koufax decides he wants to keep the child however social worker mr brooks mostel finds out that koufax isn t the real father and wants to take julian back koufax along with his new girlfriend layla lauren adams fight to keep the child big daddy really isn t that good many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny there s the occasional good one liner but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour the film after all these silly gags then suddenly turns sentimental and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable and not helped by the soppy overacting it s a poor attempt to win over the audience adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films except the wedding singer joey lauren adams is much much better and deserves a far better film than this trash steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo and his scenes are pretty funny rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man the two twins who play julian are o k they start out rather well but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn all american wholesome goodness at the end of the film where the tear juice is turned up high big daddy is really nothing special and is not even worth it for a few chuckles although it is actually well put together with nice direction good production design and even some montages this professionalism can t help the fact that the script and characters are trash big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler and that s about it 
there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see mission to mars there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind but there are those who will not and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies a space odyssey armageddon apollo the abyss close encounters of the third kind e t the extra terrestrial alien and aliens why because there is not one original idea in mission to mars all of it is cribbed from other films and in most cases better films if this is the sort of thing you don t mind you might like the film of course there are other reasons not to like mission to mars the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven t used their brains in some time and who don t intend to start during the film s running time mission to mars manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time the plot cribbed greatly from concerns a team sent to mars the first manned trip ever made to the red planet luke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith in that one was on the moon but when they try to study it a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station in a rescue mission is planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry o connell along for the ride after some zero gravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel now stranded on mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home after all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth mission to mars is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it so let s start with one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film that s it everything else fails the failure isn t de palma s fault he s working from an atrocious script only during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in where the rescue team s air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission to mars come to life a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire danger more danger attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film it s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes take it out and the plot isn t affected in any way the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes as does the rest of the film why is the ship s computer which sounds strangely like hal from uh able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine why did tim robbins character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside shouldn t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach why are the characters such idiots because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them all the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim it s too bad you can t go on this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this can t we find out these things in a less grating matter like maybe in a flashback the whole film is like that the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what s going on they must tell us exactly what we re looking at every time sample dialogue from the film shot of mars astronaut a look there s mars astronaut b you sure that s mars astronaut a yeah that s mars all right astronaut c hey are you guys looking at mars that exchange isn t actually in mission to mars but i wouldn t be surprised if it were for all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this film haven t learned to do something all those directors did very well show and don t tell de palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten this is mentally challenged filmmaking they assume the audience won t get what s going on so they explain everything five times over fourth graders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted the principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission to mars never managing to do away with an apparent i m just here to get a paycheck attitude cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines armin mueller stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance and sinise hams it up with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy handed monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolen from no less than three movies a lollipop to whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and sub par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then and of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission to mars but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow going leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters supposedly we re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the one character decides not to return ending of armageddon but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning me i alternated between the two there is only one good thing about the way mission to mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over 
bad movies described as a swift descent into sinful pleasure decay and debauchery are hard to watch bad s movies that resemble bad s films are even harder to watch shadow hours falls into the latter category a mish mashed train wreck of b movie actors including michael dorn aka star trek s worf an uninteresting plot vain attempts at capitalizing on the underground scenes of seedy los angeles and really really bad directing and horrendous music video esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out the film revolves around the life of michael holloway balthazar getty who is trying to restart his life with his one dimensional wife chloe rebecca gayheart after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l a one night he meets a strange gent named stuart mr buckaroo banzai peter weller he drives a porsche smokes french cigarettes and drones on about life eventually coaxing mike into exploring the underbelly of l a together a tour of punk bars s m clubs and bare knuckle fights the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip off of dante s inferno mixed with an old stephen j cannell television pilot the pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen johnny depp richard grieco esque acting of balthazar getty peter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesn t give two shits about it and after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs dance clubs and brothels damn isn t anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood way back in a great but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film and called it fear city shadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel director writer isaac eaton producers peter alevey andrea mia shon greenblatt balthazar getty starring balthazar getty peter weller rebecca gayheart peter greene frederic forrest brad douriff michael dorn 
synopsis cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy style ayla grows up to become a blond feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate comments allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci fi classic blade runner the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese it s so uniquely bad a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that it s oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel to this day the book possesses a loyal cult following i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother i have never read this book but i sure hope it s times better than its film adaptation if not then i m at a complete loss to explain its popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene a young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t tramps about in the woods with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audience s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla s mother a blonde with fur pants er leggings tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well as the earthquake slowly recedes a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven i won t detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point this movie is really stupid it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston the movie doesn t just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with a two by four a blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs she s of the new people they re of the old people with the memories yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up which surprises me the movie depends upon a lot of make up obviously but much of it is unconvincing as stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the characters have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the face painting that s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from its new age trappings maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the film s faux mysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you d expect to hear on a number and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated r though it s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i ve seen in quite a while it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous i m sure it s so cheesy that it probably won t bother most people the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie however as i wrote at the beginning of this review it does have the distinction of originality typically when i think of bottom of the barrel films dealing with early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though it s so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two stars i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however i m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie i shudder to think that it could be otherwise 
the main problem with martin lawrence s pet project a thin line between love and hate like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man is that his character is an irresponsible jerk and if that is the case it doesn t seem to do anything except justify the woman s actions that is especially the case in lawrence s darnell wright he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long now don t think i condone this just because i m male my philosophy is if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful kind girl you should treat her like a princess and respect her darnell doesn t think like this he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target beautiful wealthy brandi web played nicely by whitfield who runs a successful real estate business is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia king i found myself thinking i m supposed to feel sorry for this guy after all it is largely darnell s fault if he is lining up all these women you d think he d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day as his mother says it does but he doesn t so you get the sense that he s not only irresponsible but also pretty dumb you especially get this sense that he s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her i d put my pants on in two seconds after that now brandi is a psycho bitch but it s hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage one final flaw though is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with brandi is a classy intelligent woman with an mba from harvard who initally resists darnell s immature play as she calls it as any woman like her would in real life but all of a sudden she says yes but when you listen to darnell s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him lawrence can be good when he wants to but in order to prove it he needs to let other people write and direct his movies look at this movie four writers as a result it s too long two hours when it could ve easily worked at ninety minutes and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came which makes me think the writers didn t get along all of which isn t necessary there are some bright spots though whitfield regina king della reese and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts and they help it out a lot and there are some funny parts like for example the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property but they re just not enough to sustain the film 
according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers isolated motels diners gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers at the beginning of eye of the storm german american thriller directed by yuri zeltser one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up ten years later their son steven played by bradley gregg who was blinded during the incident still runs motel together with his older brother ray played by craig sheffer hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone played by dennis hopper gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra played by lara flynn boyle their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed yuri zeltser author of this film was obviously inspired by hitchcock s psycho but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot instead of norman bates we have two brothers one of them traumatised physically another mentally sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere the acting is fine hopper gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine unfortunately eye of the storm which was supposed to be intense psychological drama deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale in the end this film reminds us that original approach can t prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities special note to the profiler fans ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer s girlfriend 
when walt disney pictures announced a live action feature based on the s cartoon series of mr magoo special interests groups representing the vision impaired let out a cry of dismay mr magoo they claimed would be an insult to the men and women they represented in fact they were wrong mr magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near blind it s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny minute atrocity it s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas look at their roster of and releases and you ll see a shocking list of retreads including dalmatians george of the jungle jungle jungle that darn cat flubber and now mr magoo the best of these george of the jungle was mildly entertaining the worst mr magoo exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be the first problem with mr magoo is the script despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft mr magoo is comically barren from beginning to end there s not a laugh to be found every attempt at humor and there are lots of them falls flat with an audible thud you d think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film at least a few would work but that s not the case i ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures then there s leslie nielsen who looks sounds and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character memorably voiced by jim backus in the past nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun lately however he has been getting lazy taking parts in the likes of dracula dead and loving it spy hard and mr magoo even if nielsen was in top form it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo especially since we re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film but top form is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here this is strictly a take the money and run operation the story which like many disney stories can be described in one long sentence magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum and as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own the police mistake him for the robber the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky who take their lumps early and often the bad guys are kelly lynch who does a lot of martial arts type kicking nick chinlund and malcolm mcdowell who has the good sense to look embarrassed matt keeslar portrays one of magoo s sidekicks his nephew waldo the bumbling man s other more interesting companion is a dog named angus most of mr magoo s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick the cartoon violence level in this film doesn t approach that of home alone or flubber but it s still pretty acute with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices there s a non violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better but compared to mr bean s recent similar misadventure it doesn t hold up well then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo s near blindness such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby i m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack tong a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market has helmed several jackie chan movies including first strike rumble in the bronx and supercop his chief talent that of choreographing martial arts fights is wasted here despite some high kicking by kelly lynch like john woo hard target and ringo lam maximum risk before him it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream it is worth noting that unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under crowd while driving parents to distraction mr magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages the screening i attended was wall to wall kids and for the most part they didn t seem to be enjoying themselves when the film was over i asked one little girl what she thought of it her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words mr magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer sight unseen 
bats is this year s camp flick with the world s worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity as for the rest of us well i d say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway follow their lead and you ll spare yourself minutes of your life and bucks to boot i love alfred hitchcock s the birds almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based it saddens me even more then to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror schlock such as bats when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town the authorities call in a batologist dina meyer to investigate it turns out that a creepy scientist bob gunton has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab making them smarter and more vicious why has he done this you ask because you see it is apparently a scientist s job to make things a little better even if that means the death of all mankind so the batologist her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff lou diamond phillips have to kill all the bats and save the world of course that can t happen before they wallow in some guamo bat shit for the uninitiated get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture consider for example a scene where two people are in a bat cave the bats are all sleeping but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out what do they do do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can nope they stand there for a while transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes we don t even get to see what s going on the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick all we know is that bats are attacking how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies and bats sure could use some of course director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor but it is so conventional it doesn t really go anywhere most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist s wisecracking sidekick leon who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like i hate bats some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one liners playing such characters does not help actors careers still i suppose that if you re looking for a movie that is so bad it s good you could do worse than bats it does have a tremendous amount of camp value i m not recommending the movie because quite frankly it sucks and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it more power to them 
warner brothers rated pg mild violence sexual situations minutes director luis mandoki screenplay gerald di pego from the novel by nicholas sparks cast kevin costner robin wright penn paul newman illeana douglas robbie coltrane jesse james john savage review by geoff berkshire i m not an overly cynical guy there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years however i have my limits and i also have standards this brings us to the subject at hand message in a bottle the big ticket romance that warner brothers unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine s day the story what little of it that there is involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne robin wright penn dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason jesse james during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean the letter written to a mystery woman named catherine instantly captivates her upon her return theresa shares it with her best friend lina illeana douglas her boss charlie robbie coltrane and the entire city of chicago the newspaper publishes an article about it it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake kevin costner and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down he turns out to have a colorful father paul newman but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship of course she doesn t tell him that she found his letter she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later preferably right after they first make love this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened the discovery of the message and garret s discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film there s a truly lame subplot about garret s relationship with his dead wife s family he gets into a bar fight with her brother played by john savage and then the necessary tear jerking ending a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced and unintentionally humorous sequences filmed since well since costner s the postman message in a bottle is one slow moving film last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they re fighting the material all the way and losing badly costner and especially wright penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry the supporting players are given very little to do the reliable douglas is particularly wasted old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played however too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story gabriel yared who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient and city of angels with his scores overdoes it a bit here caleb deschanel s camera makes everything look a little too beautiful do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego working from a best selling novel by nicholas sparks which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times its strict adherence to clich s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer there simply isn t an original scene in this film the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking this is director mandoki s first film since when a man loves a woman the solid meg ryan andy garcia romance he s simply going through the motions with this message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come as one of the most misguided romances of the decade 
 goodbye lover sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may and one look will tell you why it s a mess and that s way before ellen degeneres shows up the film is one of those torrid double indemnity crime stories that in this case required the services of three screenwriters i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller one wrote a murder mystery and one wrote a comedy then director roland joff tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment i didn t laugh at ellen degeneres much i think i was supposed to degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse a tough talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair either degeneres is wearing a wig as most of the actors appear to be or she doesn t yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip but her incessant wisecracking is poorly written and merely stupid her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is at least she died healthy and that s one of her wittier asides degeneres sgt rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of wait to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple crosses it s best described this way sultry sexpot real estate agent sandra dunmore patricia arquette is married to jake a creative yet unfocused and alcoholic advertising rep played by dermot mulroney sandra likes to act out her deep seated sexual fantasies and jake s brother ben the suave as ever don johnson likes to help ben is also coming on to his petite mousy co worker peggy blaine mary louise parker and someone somewhere is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again although there are some genuine surprises the plot twists get too contrived too quickly probably around the time degeneres gumcracking gumshoe appears at least the former ellen star is going for something a little different arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto heeled platinum blonde bombshell roles see lost highway true romance while quoting embarrassing lines like i m not wearing any underwear i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this here s an example of some of the film s flat out stupidity sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film s duplicitous lovers she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite the sound of music on her car stereo intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims so what was the point of the wig and the car the sound of music stuff might be a reference to the wizard of oz allusions in david lynch s wild at heart but if so joff must have forgotten that wild at heart was a despicable movie it s hard to believe that goodbye lover was directed by the same person who made the killing fields and the mission it s not however hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long it should have stayed there 
written by alex cox tod davies terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam i ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last then there s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine laced dose mushrooms on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel a steady reassuring assent a short period of thrilling motion and color and then a smooth landing acid is for daredevils mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas director terry gilliam has made an acid movie when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie full of shocking sight gags aggressive images and grotesque comic performances the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s thompson s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world view from the inside out but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well made film gilliam has produced a mixed bag fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self professed gonzo journalist hunter s thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in operating under the pseudonyms of raoul duke and dr gonzo the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and a rainbow of multi colored uppers and downers they terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge dr gonzo becomes enamored of a thick bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane s white rabbit reaches its climax and these guys don t just trash hotel rooms they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence depending on your point of view thompson s book besides being a hilarious read has stood the test of time as an important historical document it simultaneously exposed the s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson s message but the truth is that stripped to its bare essentials what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy it s a cheech and chong movie you re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results see johnny take drugs see johnny fall down there s nothing wrong with this concept but gilliam tries too hard this is a frantic movie all sweaty close ups wide angle lenses dutch tilts and other worldly lighting schemes there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen but to what end much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson s book and there are some priceless comic observations but you re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work this brings us to the performances which strike me as all wrong depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c scott in patton a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson s dialogue in between his several puking scenes del toro fares better as dr gonzo but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads now that would have been something to see it s interesting to note that alex cox credited as a co writer on the screenplay was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over as much of a fan as i am of gilliam s work cox would have been the better choice sid and nancy cox s best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film gilliam commits the compound sin of over directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose what kind of movie was he trying to make anyway it doesn t try to be a cautionary tale and it doesn t work as broad comedy if he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been a much more interesting film but i don t want to be too hard on it there are some truly funny moments and if you re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it i do however recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance i guarantee it will enhance the effect 
before the remake of psycho appears we ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film dial m for murder as usual hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing the film opens with emily paltrow and david viggo mortensen having fun in an loft apartment the problem is paltrow is married to stephen douglas who is not too happy when he discovers this affair if i was paltrow though i d definitely go with mortensen less wrinkles anyhow stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition he ll pay him to kill his lovely wife mortensen agrees but the murder goes awry and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses unfortunately the film dosen t progress very fast in fact it moves like a tortoise with arthritis read very very s l o w the plot moves nowhere fast and only becomes exciting in very short bursts not too good for a thriller also the performances apart from douglas are below par paltrow showing immense talent in se en and sliding doors is strangely stilted even unconvincing in this movie mortensen is a little bit better coming across as a younger douglas but his role isn t meaty enough to show all his talent which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film which is does however i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking drinking womanizer with a creepy underside also popping up in the film is david suchet playing a shifty looking detective again it s not a character we re seeing on the screen it s david suchet the director who bought us the fugitive piles on all the flash techniques such as zoom in s quick cuts etc the lighting is also interesting however looks can t save this film from the depths of mediocre and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway the screenplay is o k but there s some hackneyed sub plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street again and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched the characters also make incredibly dumb moves especially paltrow and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel with a combination of no tension drama or decent characters a perfect murder is a failure all round and an incredible disappointment there are a few bright moments but they are far and few between the last thing a thriller should be is boring and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas you wouldn t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder overall rating review by david wilcock you know for kids norville barnes 
post chasing amy a slew of love triangle movies this month we have kissing a fool co starring amy s own lee and april brings us the object of my affection which may as well be titled chasing allan for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it that film stars schwimmer s friend jennifer aniston if only kevin smith could write them all schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max who falls in love with his best friend jay lee s book editor samantha avital a mere twenty four hours after meeting her they are soon engaged and max because of his own raging libido grows suspicious of samantha s fidelity he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book to test her the trouble is jay might be secretly in love with her to stretch this flat sitcom premise to feature length the plot is framed by a climactic wedding at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale the events leading up to the nuptials to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue and lee poor lee is miscast so hysterically funny in chasing amy here he is forced to repress his comic instincts to swear to yell to talk about oral sex the script s idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a sensitive man and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he s stewing over his girl trouble as for avital an israeli actress she is warm and sweet but we don t know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer who plays schwimmer s assistant and personal temptress turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo there are a handful a smattering of good scenes in kissing a fool i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club during which jay gets up and asks has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her over and over until he s booted off stage there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that s on the page kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke machine friends that spawned schwimmer s movie career so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back 
bad bad bad that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls if that summary isn t enough for you how about t a t a t a still haven t got the point other than director russ meyer s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore mentioned anatomical areas there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie that is the fact that it was co written by famed film critic roger ebert who also was responsible for the screenplay after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face this movie stinks out loud quite frankly this movie deserves a but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny so i m giving it a and maybe that is too generous right from the opening credits i knew that i had a class a bomb on my hands not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening it does get explained later and as soon as the first scene is over we cut to a completely unrelated scene to be honest as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film it wouldn t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained so what is this movie about you ask like it really matters ok here goes this all girl band headed by kelly macnamara dolly reed and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry once there they do manage to find success due as much to their hooters as anything else it sure wasn t for their brutally bad singing voices and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them everything from big egos to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here other than the above mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts mr ebert has generously thrown in helpings of hey man dig and my all time favorite this is my happening and it freaks me out now i ask you with lines like that how can you go wrong ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter i don t know but all the big words in the world wouldn t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie i ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey in fact there is one scene the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries add to the directing and writing the music in this movie i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers then we have the cast first lets start david gurian who played harris the manager of the band this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera sadly his acting doesn t come close to making up for his looks if you have been following along up to this point this shouldn t surprise you meyer s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets dolly reed plays kelly the leader of the band and no surprise here she was cast for her cup size not her talents and yes she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents sadly her ass is almost as large as her chest hey it a sexist movie so i m writing a sexist review then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey one of the other band members this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all sure russ now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows on the up side she does have a fun lesbo scene i sound like i m writing a review in a porn magazine but hey i ll admit it the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked and since that was a huge disappointment i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d s you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls beware this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense proceed with extreme caution 
ex universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer model engineered fighters gone bad the review jean claude van damme has a one liner early on in universal soldier the return his latest attempt to remain relevant that sums up this entire movie he says been there done that no film critic could possibly sum up van damme s recent film choices any better while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him martial arts and guns this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex he joins fellow martial artist action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away universal soldier the return is truly poor the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade specifically terminator judgement day and the similarly named soldier soldier s kurt russell was an older model super soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors for the good of a planet schwarzenegger s terminator in t tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine the t and jean claude a former universal soldier has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of you guessed it newer model soldiers considering the poor box office performance of soldier it s amazing that this project was ever given the go ahead luc devereaux van damme was the sole remaining universal soldier or unisol for short until he was returned to a normal if muscular human form in this sequel technically the fourth film in the series following two straight to video duds that were ignored here plot wise luc is now a human trainer consultant of sorts for the unisol program working with dylan cotner xander berkeley who interestingly also appeared in t the unisol program has engineered a tougher fiercer fighting force with the help of super computer seth unfortunately upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government seth takes control of his soldiers killing everyone in the building except for luc his partner maggie his daughter hillary and erin a reporter trapped inside the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive while beating up a group of near indestructible soldiers most notably romeo popular wrestler goldberg there are lots of fights gun battles lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility there are so many clich s in this film that it is almost painful to watch luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on and in the course of a single night they go from bickering to falling for each other to kissing erin is a pathetically written character people are getting brutally gunned down all around her and yet not only does this not seem to frighten her but she finds time to remind luc that she isn t leaving without her story whatever other laughable moments include a luc going to a strip club to get internet access what and b a group of rangers who after having been given good advice luc tells them that their weapons are useless and shows them a specific gun which should work better choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway guess who wins the battle not one single scene in universal soldier the return has any originality to it when fuelled by don davis loud driving music score the film s many fights become almost passable but mostly are full of the same ol jean claude moves director mic rodgers a former stunt co ordinator keeps the action coming at a rapid pace with only a few token serious moments to be found his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion if only jean claude weren t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li rodgers could probably have made a decent action film to place the blame squarely at van damme s feet however is an injustice i m not sure that anyone not even robert deniro or edward norton could make writers william malone and john fasano s script sound good one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access he cringes looks down and mutters uh uhm they all do i saw it on minutes eh he he he the script s and indeed the entire film s only saving grace is goldberg he chews up every scene he is in obviously enjoying his role immensely he even gives the film a few laughs as he mutters things like i really don t like that guy every time he fails to kill luc sadly his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier the return into anything better than a below average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight to video 
plot a little boy born in east germany named hansel loves the american music one day he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g i but first he must get a sex change enter hedwig once married the two move to the states but quickly thereafter get a divorce at that point hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy who soon turns into a star that boy also turns his back on hedwig and it isn t long before hedwig puts together his her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants this is the story of his her life told via flashbacks and musical numbers critique an artsy fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell doesn t really come together as a whole with over the top symbolism incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through in fact this isn t so much of a realistic articulate behind the scenes look at the rise of a rock n roll star as it is an ambiguous overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet i guess that i was expecting the former going in the film is somewhat interesting to a point but i was personally never able to involve myself too much as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience chances are that if you are a fan of the wall the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla queen of the desert the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point and provide the lyrics of their song on screen well i personally don t care for those films and didn t really get into the whole show atmosphere of this movie either i guess i might ve looked at it all too literally but like i said earlier i just didn t care enough about the characters to delve into the so the butterfly represents his freedom side of things all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn t make me feel any more fulfilled what was hedwig s relationship with that other member of his band with the beard what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie was that an actual sequence or a fantasy what ever happened to the lawsuit and more all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his her sexuality then that s one thing but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well i didn t get it the film s humor also didn t tickle my funny bone either then again i ve seen many a film in these art house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added atmosphere of a plant called marijuana and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements in order to jazz up that experience but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent funny musical with a transsexual twist i didn t leave the theater very satisfied i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle wrapped in metaphors dramatics and more questions than answers i will on the other hand definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film john cameron mitchell who is also the man who wrote directed and created the play on which this movie is based and the tunes which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols david bowie and the whole s glam rock scene note btw it seems as though pretty much every single mainstream critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom and thought that it was really funny to boot so you might want to take that into consideration yourself but having said that the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the official critics while i a regular joblo in the audience just wouldn t get what all the fuss was about this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews where s joblo coming from moulin rouge grease everyone says i love you the opposite of sex dancer in the dark o brother where art thou love s labour s lost 
the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities the best tales of the genre deal with mankind s struggle for survival or knowledge such popular and noteworthy tomes as stranger in a strange land by robert heinlein childhood s end by arthur c clarke and man in the high castle and do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick all deal with man s need for identity and struggle for self worth hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu if not the message of science fiction since it s beginnings most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved it really wasn t until producer george pal took charge of robert heinlein s novel rocketship galileo and crafted the film destination moon that sci fi as it is commonly referred to came into it s own from there such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre with the release of touchstone pictures mission to mars we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe the film opens on a summer barbecue as phil ohlmyer jerry o connell woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission woody blake tim robbins and his wife terri connie nielsen commit to his coming authority on the mission and luc goddard don cheadle consoles his son entering the party is jim mcconnell gary sinise who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife maggie kim delaney luc consoles jim with woody s assistance the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface going out to investigate luc and his team approach the famed face on mars a strange noise emanates from the rock as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar a violent wind storm erupts creating a vortex that kills all members of the team save for luc back on the space station orbiting earth woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing luc s interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger meteorite showers explosions and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet s surface the big question is is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars and if so what is its relationship with us now for the bad news the entire plot of mission to mars is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe the famed face on mars becomes the centerpiece of the film revealing some of the most harebrained sci fi pabulum the screen has witnessed borrowing ideas from such films as robinson crusoe on mars quatermass and the pit a space odyssey and even mario bava s planet of the vampires terrore nello spazio mission to mars is a hodgepodge of ideas that don t add up to a satisfying whole while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed the film remains flat and un involving so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film but to no good use the performances are all workmen like with only don cheadle as luc carrying any sort of real chemistry gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation and the mistaken idea of having jerry o connell as phil ohlmyer play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better he s just having too much fun here to give a damn the script has a few lapses namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship also when one character sacrifices himself the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid intrusive score by ennio morricone subtlety is non existent here in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower the pacing of the film is very leisurely after the opening introduction of the characters which lasts a full minutes we are finally dropped onto the martian surface then there is another long pause in the plot for more character development including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity the film could lose about minutes and actually gain some momentum there are so many scenes of talking heads discussing what we already know is going to happen that it drags the film to a dead stop the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted with a level of realism that hasn t been seen since a space odyssey the visual effects are just stunning from the space walk sequences to the visualization of evolution on earth the only fault come with the martians themselves which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un interrupted cut lasting almost minutes an homage to hitchcock s rope as we are introduced to all of the characters scenes in the rescue ship with its rotating centrifuge are just amazing in their execution but the nagging question is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang sadly it is not director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production the set design and visual effects are all arresting but it s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous thought provoking science fiction a disappointing film but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals 
john boorman s zardoz is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d wood jr has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time of course wood s career can be explained by two things he had no money and he had no talent boorman on the other hand cannot court such excuses to explain zardoz or his follow up film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic boorman obviously had a sizable budget a matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldn t know it from this film boorman does indeed have talent this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste if boorman is anything he s ambitious and when he succeeds it s in grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around zardoz is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boorman s his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz a book which figures into the movie s plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling the events take place in the distant year but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found in fact things seems to have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting old style guns and living in large victorian mansions it s more middle ages than space age the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life these immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society however if one breaks the rules that person is punished by being aged so many years if someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals one of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopts a god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head this flying head is one of the movie s opening images and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come calling himself zardoz frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can t procreate and take up more resources from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like the gun is good the penis is evil that line alone is worth the movie s cult following one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardoz s flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back to the vortex once there the immortals label him a brutal and study him like a lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is a mystery to them they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up i say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of faces although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper a mane of hair braided halfway down his back a wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and a pair of thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green light this effort he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond film in and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace he got exactly that in zardoz and it s a wonder it didn t end his career i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing or is it a social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary come to think of it maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy 
disconnect the phone line don t accept the charges do anything you can to avoid the wretched melodramatic sisterhood dramedy hanging up i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side and hanging up seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so the film features an incredible palate of female talent and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as sleepless in seattle and unsung heroes meg ryan diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who once separated by career judgments over family ties must reunite when their father walter matthau is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer s disease while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery hanging up has the overall effect of a tele marketer pestering you for two hours while you don t have the option of doing as the title suggests for the first half hour the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development this is an annoying and ineffective device cell phones ring every five minutes and everyone hurriedly rushes along leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters issues and problems if hanging up was an apple pie then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story granted there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck the most outrageous strategy in hanging up is that after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale we are able to identify with eve ryan the most open and caring daughter because she is the one who stayed by her father s side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career georgia keaton the eldest daughter is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called georgia maddy kudrow the soap opera actress spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog ryan s convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of hanging up kudrow so delightfully eccentric as the off kilter airhead phoebe in friends is totally wasted ditto for keaton who is serving a double shift as co star and director a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle her frenzy is apparent for a chick flick there is a distressing lack of chuckles the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that given his character s situation seems more depressing than amusing even so the peak form of humor in hanging up is represented by some of matthau s nasty quips and ryan s eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star studded approach could turn so viciously sour but really it s no mystery the predictable melodramatic filth that is hanging up is certainly not the fault of these actresses pin it on the screenplay which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations it s certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience but hanging up should have at least been enjoyable uh uh it s a wrong number from the beginning 
the most interesting part of can t hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of us the one part that many of us can easily relate to that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the film s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored the film wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party almost too nicely for some members of the audience read me this is basically a mirror of what s going on with them watching this film we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this after all this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with everyone s here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions of trekkies and x philes the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead s the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial lame and basically as a bunch of losers except for denise who rolls her eyes at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there unfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film the film as i said portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going a bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes we follow several of them all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and or identified with them and if we did we certainly don t want to revisit that state of being here s a quick low down it s graduation and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night otherwise known as the american grafitti or to a lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party can t hardly wait just opts for a big indoor keg party and a little bit of aimless driving albeit of the i m whining because i can t get a girl i want brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer who s been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his love for her in the hopes he ll build up the guts to give it to her even though he s leaving for a multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film and because it s a party there are some more main characters such as william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike who s humiliated him for years but gets too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom don t ask with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes films of the s most notably sixteen candles the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this film forgets to satirize its characters and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes and then says that it s all okay we can t take this film seriously nor can we take this as fun so really what good is it but i will tell you some things i did like i liked the direction except for a couple too over the top features like way too glossy jump cuts it s like an oxymoron and other obscurities generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time a thing with a note though is too hokey to really be admirable i actually did like seth green for once in about a decade when he played a very young woody allen in radio days his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film however the character of denise really doesn t work with the film when really thought about she s far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone she s not just the cynic or the intellectual she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters she may ruin the film more but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least we ll be entertained a couple other things that just don t work mike s character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me a break and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all jenna eflman s uncredited cameo as an angel just didn t work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason i m giving this such a low rating is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we d do we don t feel for these characters because for most of us we aren t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots the acid test for high school movies is does it at all capture the feel of what it s portraying the answer for this film is no nice try though

a movie laced with a good blend of action comedy and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters blues brothers is being unleashed minus half of its original duo the late john belushi and nearly all of its original charm dan aykroyd reprises his role as well as his co writing credit as elwood blues the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self proclaimed mission from god along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago as we begin elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother s death in prison years ago completely on his own elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away but elwood isn t completely without family it seems he has a half brother of sorts not a real brother mind you just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo father curtis cab calloway from the first film who has also passed on despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata kathleen freeman to do otherwise elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band working as a police commander cabel chamberlain joe morton has an immediate disliking for elwood who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother s affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster j evan bonifant who quickly learns to become a mini elwood when bartender mighty mack mcteer john goodman joins the group the blues brothers band is complete and once again the group travels the country crashing cars blowing things up and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock meanwhile cab s personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next to next of kin from this point the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between those hoping for an interesting and or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours for those people it may be worth it for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting but when the story does intrude upon the festivities the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes musicians turned stiff actors and the pointless year old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin james brown eric clapton and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors blues brothers is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really really love this kind of music you might kind of sort of like this movie many many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny and if you don t have a passion for very deep blues rock you ll be bored out of your skull much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd s self serving vanity project but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this none of the excitement is passed on to the audience and seeing three guys in three piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long unfortunately those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film 
one of my brother s favorite movies is h b halicki s cult flick gone is sixty seconds one of the best products of the car chase genre that provided drive in fare during the s chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue but they had a strong visceral appeal although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars the remake of gone in sixty seconds is relatively weak and dull randall memphis raines nicolas cage is a retired car thief who runs a go cart track he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip giovanni ribisi would not take up boosting cars however kip became a thief anyway and now he s in big trouble kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri christopher eccleston by the end of the week calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip s bargain if he doesn t come through kip dies memphis gathers his old crew angelina jolie robert duvall will patton chi mcbride and vinnie jones and kip brings his boys t j cross william lee scott scott caan and james duval as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn t bad enough the team is pursued by a cop delroy lindo who s still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster rap star master p who wants to take over calitri s clients watching gone i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one maybe that s why the first forty nine are fairly easy and the thrills are saved for eleanor a shelby gto a model that has always eluded memphis but the big chase doesn t live up to the long wait i had high hopes for gone because it is director dominic sena s second film kalifornia his debut was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot a couple gives a serial killer a ride and successfully endowed it with deeper significance in gone he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can t communicate with each other but that goal just doesn t mesh with this plot gone either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough it s not light enough to be fun or mean enough to be intense this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it the lack of action is a waste of the premise which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever the weak script is a waste of a talented cast in a newsweek interview last year sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies much as i like cage for every good picture he does leaving las vegas bringing out the dead there are two major stinkers snake eyes con air mm city of angels that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast but cage has real talent it s a shame to waste it in glitzy superficial tripe like gone in seconds 
reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy analyze this i asked myself how could this miss robert de niro taxi driver raging bull billy crystal city slickers lisa kudrow the opposite of sex and director harold ramis national lampoon s vacation these are usually reliable filmmakers well okay crystal has been in a sizable slump lately and tellingly the first half hour of analyze this was very funny unfortunately as the running time ticked away i began to think that the first thirty minutes had unbeknownst to me been rewound and were being replayed another two and a half times the film has obtained a clever premise but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen middle aged psychoanalyst ben sobel s billy crystal life is finally going very well although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents especially his father who is also a psychiatrist ben has an easy going teenage son kyle sabihy and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend laura lisa kudrow in little but a flash however ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti robert de niro who desperately wants counseling even though he himself won t even admit to having anxiety attacks ben tries to help paul mostly so he will get him off his back but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death it seems to ben that no matter what he does paul vitti will not go away and the more they become involved the more ben s potentially happy life gets into danger analyze this has a few laughs sprinkled throughout mostly in the first half but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan ramis and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the minute running time admittedly de niro is very funny here and i can t remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him and crystal is in top form but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them including a substantial plotline since analyze this bills not one not two but three writers you d think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws but they must have all been on auto pilot one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters all of which have next to nothing to do and aren t even given multi dimensional characters to attempt to develop coming off of her oscar caliber work in two of last year s best films clockwatchers and the opposite of sex lisa kudrow s throwaway girlfriend role is an incredible step down sure kudrow s fellow friend jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in office space but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston kudrow meanwhile mostly just stands around no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place chazz palminteri as rival gangster primo fares even worse in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character finally molly shannon rising film star and cast member on saturday night live has a rousingly hilarious one scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal s patients and then completely disappears too bad considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal once analyze this approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow s laura standing alone at the altar once again i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most ben afterwards the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul became a real laugh free dead zone losing its last remaining comic punches analyze this proves that talent can certainly help any film out but when the written material isn t up to their level what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air 
among multitude of erotic thrillers that had been released in the early s woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty star of the b grade action films of the previous decade those who tend not to be nostalgic about s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star as director ginty did very little to improve that impression the protagonist of the movie is jack played by jeff fahey yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford played by bo derek however she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby steven bauer one stormy night the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder however his good friend walter j hill robert mitchum happens to be very good lawyer so jack might even prove his innocence in the end belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots unfortunately this film isn t comedy and any laugh is unintentional the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them the actors that play them don t help either that is especially the case with jeff fahey whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison his partner bo derek on the other hand shows that she didn t age enough to cease being the sex goddess but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents ginty on the other hand tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer 
this talky terribly plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux an ex new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder mystery after a light plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat he and his wife annie kelly lynch rescue a little salvadorian girl samantha lagpacan from the wreckage and that s when the trouble begins the other major players include a local drug lord eric roberts his scheming wife teri hatcher a soused stripper mary stuart masterson and a shady dea agent vondie curtis hall everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that s curious but never compelling based on the book by james lee burke heaven s prisoners is so badly plotted that entire scenes seem to be missing early on we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa later dave is reunited with a drug abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation huh the whole movie is like this perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf whatever the reason somebody should tell director phil joanou final analysis to recut this mess in its present form heaven s prisoners runs only two hours plus change but it feels like four 
by the time dennis quaid the ostensible star of switchback makes his first appearance at about the minute mark you may find yourself wondering why he bothered after all writer director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines the first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead r lee ermey facing a hotly contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction as olmstead begins his investigation we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects lane dixon jared leto is an enigmatic young hitchhiker bob goodall danny glover is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other s protagonist but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years he s not supposed to be tracking him any more according to the bureau they ve got their man but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise two months earlier lacrosse s own son was kidnapped by the killer and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere lacrosse knows his killer s work and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game it wouldn t be fair to reduce everything that s wrong with switchback to quaid s presence but it s a pretty good place to start there s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center as a dramatic actor dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight jawed sourpuss pucker we can tell he s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood esque rasp a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character pulling the audience into his haunted intensity making switchback his film quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated it s tough to become emotionally invested in a character s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes even without quaid it doesn t appear that switchback would have stayed on course the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy building our curiosity over which man the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor is the real threat unfortunately stuart tips his hand far too early in the game both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal once the mystery of the killer s identity is dispatched the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable in fact stale and predictable describes the direction that switchback takes in general falling back on far too common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere a climactic fistfight on board a freight train and edgy law enforcement agents it s too bad stuart wasn t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film played with atypical restraint by r lee ermey he s a wonderful unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story telling instead stuart places his trust in a name star who can t carry the material maybe next time he ll throw away that one crucial page in the script the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story 
sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things and pushing tin certainly features some name stars who are going places billy bob thornton cate blanchett angelina jolie and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first but he s actually the veteran among this quartet of fine looking people sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has hip comedy written all over it compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits compensate for clich d characterizations compensate for embarrassing you have to be joking situations etc in pushing tin thornton blanchett jolie and cusack don t have an earthly from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble squiggly quirky credits fake looking passenger planes circling new york and anne dudley s in your ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for the full monty let alone won it but i for one wasn t ready to walk just yet so quickly we descend into a tightly edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job yes what with their frantic mile a minute instructional personas juggling planes and passenger s lives like some huge real mid air video game hip cool demonic auctioneer nick the zone falzone cusack is the best in the biz of course until some hipper cooler leather clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell thornton shows up to challenge falzone s finite air space boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding then the macho one upmanship begins it doesn t stop with seeing who can juggle three s within a cat s whisker of each other oh no there are some broken hoop dreams some wanna see how fast i can drives and then the ultimate showdown was that my wife i saw you with last night director mike newell four weddings and a funeral must have read a different draft of this script because the one that s being acted out up there between newark jfk and la guardia doesn t have an ounce of subtlety and newell has made some awfully good and funny movies before the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe they ll make you frown in disbelief they ll have you constantly looking at your watch but wait there s still minutes to go the film s only saving grace is blanchett whose connie falzone is a spunky brash long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red headed australian gambler oscar and lucinda and a tempestuous british monarch elizabeth but she s not enough to save the picture thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke jolie as russell s knock em dead wife isn t bad but the up and coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything cusack cracks gum dons shades and acts hip throughout but like everything else in the film his performance is forced in the last ten minutes or so for some inexplicable reason things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been like the trailer teases but it s too little too late a fine cast aside pushing tin is nothing more than an embarrassment 
 an intimate character driven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life read the press notes for reach the rock i m not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow completely uninvolving bore i saw at least it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film alessandro nivola plays robin fleming a troubled directionless year old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town police sergeant phil quinn william sadler takes him in and what ensues for the first minutes is a tedious series of sneak outs and sneak ins where robin slips out of his jail cell breaks a window then returns all without quinn ever noticing also added to the pointless proceedings is some would be humorous shenanigans involving quinn s dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna karen sillas with a half hour if even that long remaining director william ryan and writer john hughes yes john hughes of s youth films and home alone finally approach something close to a point turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise brooke langton who has long gone on with her life and hughes s main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired live in the present and for the future message most moviegoers however will likely be asleep by that time wide awake however is the cast who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill thus revealing the real purpose behind this listless enterprise to serve as a series of acting exercises such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors but it leaves audiences with a booby prize opens october 
 it was not scary these are the first words that came to mind after it was over when a movie is called vampires not scary aren t words that should be associated with it but that wasn t my only gripe john carpenter is a name associated with cutting edge cinema as in the intense scares of halloween the thing and the prince of darkness or the offbeat action of they live and escape from new york unfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about vampires is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach with an anemic plot and not quite kosher special effects john carpenter s vampires has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers led by james woods of all people like some sort of holy a team they even have their own souped up van the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack their method is amusingly innovative the blood suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks to commemorate their victory the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away their celebration is short lived however as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single handedly destroys most of the team woods jack crow and buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape with their lives along with a woman named katrina sheryl lee although the woman has been bitten montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek thomas ian griffith a freaky marilyn manson type who s on a mission that dates back years along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau tim guinee a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl upham in saving private ryan some stuff happens in the middle of the movie but i can t remember most of it because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen vampires finally starts to pick up about minutes into the mix as crow guiteau and montoya assault an abandoned prison turned vampire nest only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick but it s too little too late we get the inevitable final confrontation but it seems tacked on and rather anti climactic come on we re dealing with the master vampire here interestingly last summer s vampire actioner blade was derived from a comic book and vampires from a novel yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former a more deliberate superhero flick woods jack crow spouts glib off the cuff one liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh so cool stride and his motive for killing vampires take a wild guess hint a killed his when he was just a at least blade had decent action and slick stylishness vampires lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer thin plot to make up for this the movie resorts to other shocks such as its generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps them around for the fun of it and an overplayed contempt for religion crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to getting woodies it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie if not scary and gory i wanted tense relentless and exhausting john carpenter s vampires is none of these i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan for the rest of you looking for a good scare beware vampires is a film with no teeth 
chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception instead of a speeding bus we now have an ice cream truck the truck is driven by arlo cuba gooding jr and mason skeet ulrich who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder this particular weapon nicknamed elvis must be kept below a temperature of degrees or else the shockwave will goo iffy everything in a mile radius that would be pretty nasty the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene as dr richard long david paymer conducts a test on an isolated tropical island long accidentally melts soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance the commanding officer general brynner peter firth is sentenced to years in prison for the murder of his troops upon his release the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down snatching elvis and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ulrich and a feisty ice cream delivery man gooding jr who must elude brynner s men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder all the while of course they must keep the weapon below degrees this proves to be tricky among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree covered mountainside in a boat and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing to put it simply i ll use a clever pun chill factor should be put on ice director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie when there is some occasional action the audience seems oddly detached from it perhaps that s because we ve already waded through a pool of clich s and boring dialogue all material that s been used before and with a lot more spice take the villains for example they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint and act in very predictable ways the tag team of gooding jr and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is frankly i m not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man i suppose it s better than him dressed like a giant hot dog selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner gooding displays one single emotion in this movie which is frequently on display in lines like i m gonna get on yo ass like last year s underwear and the incessant sputtering of oh sh t this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets but where gooding was once an exciting actor he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous at least he s a bit more captivating than ulrich who has all the film s worst dialogue but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character the supporting cast which includes every personality you expect to pop up is also wasted to be fair there are a few brief moments of serviceable action and i did chuckle a few times one example is when ulrich an employee at darlene s diner is at the counter when brynner walks through the door you own this place the general asks yeah ulrich says they call me darlene these little tidbits of humor are mainly welcome in this weak disappointing wreckage of an action film as a speed clone it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps god forbid even some decent writing sadly i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been 
she was the femme in la femme nikita he was the baldwin in backdraft sliver and fair game with cindy crawford together anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make shattered image the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone stone thriller the specialist the film poses the question what if the life you re living now is really a dream and your dreams reality it s either about a woman who s haunted by a recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that she s a hired assassin or it s about a hired assassin who s haunted by a recurring and recurring and recurring nightmare that she s honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica it doesn t much matter and believe me by the time shattered image runs its painful and pedestrian course you won t care these two lives with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig black emotionless eyes and black leather clothing in the seattle based assassin scenes and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it s now twice as boring as it might have been it s not that complicated plots can t be entertaining of course it helps if you have interesting characters crisp dialogue and a modicum of style shattered image isn t complex it s just stupid and boring parillaud and baldwin who aren t exactly shakespearean material to begin with are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines lines like you don t beg you insist i like that in a woman that s parillaud s character talking to her cat and you re not the reason i couldn t care less about you huh and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film if you give me a couple of minutes you know i ll charm the pants off you i don t have that kind of time talking of pants parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say point of no return we have come to expect this from billy baldwin but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first but there s nothing to learn karen is as interesting as a cereal box a someone s out to get me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone the stranger who sends her flowers maybe even her husband himself is her would be killer siouxsie is the chromium cool tough as nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film s meaningless stock title baldwin seems more interested in parillaud s nest egg so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot than he does in her each time graham greene shows up he gets killed barbet schroeder reversal of fortune co produced and should be ashamed of himself every now and again it s fun to watch a really bad movie and every now and again as shattered image makes agonizingly clear it isn t 
numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci fi suspense thrillers soldier is a multi crossbreed between the likes of terminator aliens and offspring the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground besides this the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured slow and sluggish and could have done with better choreography russell who is usually a good actor in b grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character sergeant todd who seems more like a sergeant toad besides having almost no dialogue his character appears stunted zombie like which is in line with his screen persona but scores little points of empathy with the audience this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former it is still a long way from anything considered desirable 
warning spoilers are included in this review but it doesn t really make much of a difference deep impact begins the official summer movie season and it also brings back memories of remember when dante s peak came out in february a few months later volcano was released the first film was smart exhilirating and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent well it s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition this time unfortunately the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon the upcoming comet disaster to be released the beginning of july of course the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine and so i am in the minority as i was when i stood on the side of dante s peak but while watching deep impact i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film apparently many did and it utterly baffles me to be completely honest i haven t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo but it was still rather fun to watch deep impact doesn t just have implausibilities it also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects and a poorly constructed plot the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters deep impact begins in an unnamed year the year varies advanced technology sets it in the future but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater pushing it back to a line of students is outside at night peering through telescopes at the dark sky above among these are leo biederman elijah wood and sarah hotchner leelee sobieski leo unknowingly discovers a comet and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds he races off to mail the information but is killed in a reckless car accident a year passes and nothing is heard about it again we are then introduced to jenny lerner t a leoni a reporter for msnbc she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse james cromwell she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie after talking with rittenhouse and unsatisfied with the information she gets she decides to use the internet for help luckily she knows exactly how to spell the certain ellie that she is looking for they spell it ele in the film that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled before she can use the information the government decides to push her car off the road they take her in to meet the president of the united states president beck morgan freeman beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference naturally she wants to be compensated and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question and so yada yada yada they reveal the comet to the public and their plans send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive they announce a plan called ark which is their only hope for survival a computer will select people at random these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won t kill off the entire human race after two years the dust will settle actually it would take much much longer approximately ninety years from what i understand and the humans could come back to the surface and start over the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures but there is one subplot worth mentioning jenny and her father jason maximilian schell have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional it s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt now of course we all know that the comet does impact the surface the title alone suggests it and the previews actually show it by doing this absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won t work director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show er her major film debut was the peacemaker a pathetic and heartless action film well this time leder outdid herself creating a film worse than that one suggestion to ms leder please stay away from the big screen or at least the action genre much of the blame can be placed on leder directly because the pace is disastrously off throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed it goes from months to weeks to hours it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real time it s that boring of course leder isn t all to blame for it screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time what starts out promising soon turns deadly for the audience anyway chock full of cheesy one liners you know you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school and stupid characters you might think we were back in the s again only one of the subplots is remotely interesting while the rest are forgettable and boring and the main plot is so outrageous that you can t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action drama or sci fi to put it simply the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation that s right miss and hit scenes above the earth are well done and the orbiting ship is majestic but the comet is a huge mistake making it more laughable than frightening the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough but that s forgiveable what isn t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface give me a break will ya and of course the much hyped collision of comet and earth well it is far from spectacular and it makes independence day look brilliant the water rushing towards the land is effective but once it hits the continent the effects turn ridiculous cgi water is used and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks in fact i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days just when we think visual effects can t be improved along comes a film to show that they really can and should be one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder s direction which also influences the actors leder loves to show the actors faces before and during moments of terror this reminded me of another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations leder likes to flaunt people s fears via their faces but instead of coming off as sympathetic leder seems more of a sadist one moment has an astronaut flying off into space this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person s face while drifting into space this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience and i for one am not going to be fooled on another note leder s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts the pace does pick up and some very emotional moments are shown then again when you watch people cry for their loved ones it s obvious it will be emotional it s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into feeling for the characters but it didn t work for me but anyway the actors do as much as they can with what they are given t a leoni bad boys tv s the naked truth is the best of the film and she is given the meatiest role her character is made stronger by leoni s presence and we grow to care for her robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch but his character is turned into shreds by the plot elijah wood also comes off rather successfully but he still hasn t had many good roles wood stick to drama you are too talented for this stuff vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen maximilian schell is distracting but he does provide some nice humor morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this and gives one of his most shallow performances to date which is quite remarkable for him leelee sobieski could have been better but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby eldard is good in his role but is limited by the plot crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv s star trek the next generation seeing her was one of the highlights of the film overall a very talented cast virtually wasted deep impact is rated pg for disaster related elements and brief language this is one of the worst films of the year and if it is any omen of things to come this summer could be one of the worst ever luckily the x files movie is coming up and hopefully armageddon will be more successful it s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn t worth much costing nearly million with special effects done by the illustrious ilm which is a huge shocker and with a score composed by oscar winner james horner titanic one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience well it s not when the comet does hit the earth you almost wish it could just take this film along with it 
you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year they re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box office holiday season combine that with howie long s first starring action role and you ve got a doozy of a movie that while not as bad as it could have been isn t a very good film howie stars as an ace smokejumper a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground in the slightly contrived opening scenes we witness his heroism in action as he and his mentor played by scott glenn attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire william forsythe plays the bad guy a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak he and five convict cohorts manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards but since there must be a movie luck is with him soon the now escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters why canadian who knows eh along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher suzy amis to be their hostage enter howie long he s called in to help fight the blaze and when he spots the group of ground pounders apparently lost he parachutes in to help when he discovers their true identity he is the only thing standing between them and escape and the only hope of help for the hostage long s acting talents are above those of say steven seagal but not by much although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden he s a likeable hero and there are some hints here and there that he may get better the script doesn t help him out any however all too often it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny the dialogue is strictly b movie material and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable long s co stars are a mixed bag at least they re all comfortable in their respective roles forsythe has the scenery chewing villain down cold down cold and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch even when he doesn t seem to be stretching his talents as is definitely the case here suzy amis plays peril pretty well but isn t given much more to do some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting but many are rather bland you d think that the director dean semler a former cinematographer would at least produce a film with interesting visuals that s not the case there s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences we ve seen this stuff before it s not the most auspicious start to but it could have been worse just think back to s debut bio dome however after a month of oscar caliber pictures a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were in fact there s a good chance that some of them are still playing near you 
the happy bastard s quick movie review wild wild west a better name for this movie might ve been wild wild waste warner bros in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie had managed to lasso in some big names actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld the duo behind mib s success in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster a contemporary big screen update to the classic western sci fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad but somehow they ran into a problem along the way they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would ve made all the difference a story writer wild wild west s story and script was compiled by six different people rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black ed solomon if warner bros had gotten him the movie would ve possibly been five times better than what it is heck ten times as is however the story and screenplay is a mess filled with dead laughs enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he s performing them and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well here s the story us army member james west will smith teams up with creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half was blown off during the civil war leaving him to roll around in a steam controlled wheelchair they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an foot tarantula although it looks bigger than that hellbent on destroying anything in its path as i said the way the script unfolds is a complete mess but the acting doesn t help either kevin kline is miserable as gordon failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the western silverado smith seems to be having a better time as west although he s not nearly as charming as he was in mib branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain perhaps to the point where we can t even stand to look at him or his strange beard and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father but mostly she exists just for sexual attention her acting is barely passable but what a breath of fresh ass director barry sonnenfeld isn t of great help either even though he shows some good creativity at some points his overall urgency for directing is lost it s as if he feels he s directing a tv movie a big no no when you re helming what s supposed to be a big screen hit last but not least there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable at one point smith defies gravity when first boarding kline s train he jumps on the back gets launched straight up in the air and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train while it s still in motion also he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks last but not least why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he s not kissing a woman as he s looking through a peephole at the enemy the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show there s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades but again a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west but it really isn t possible if the racist and sex jokes don t bother you the performances will if the performances don t bother you the story will if the story doesn t bother you the racist and sex jokes will there s no end to the vicious circle go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats you ll have a better time if you do go keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant i bet he wishes he were somewhere else

i never understood what the clich hell on earth truly meant until very recently i ve just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying so horrible so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as hell on earth after all i ve never been to war i ve never been the victim of any violent crime i ve never really been broken hearted and i ve never been audited so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was hell on earth then i saw cruel intentions in a perfect world i would be in charge of all the movie studios the very first thing i d do in this perfect world would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv and throw them in jail but it wouldn t just be your average jail not even a maximum security installation i d have these producers and everyone else involved in the production of these films put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity now you re probably thinking to yourself is this really how bad cruel intentions is the answer is no it s actually much worse watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble s awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound and then pouring acid on the salt i don t know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum tara reid whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom from that opening scene where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz to the conclusion which i don t remember because i had practically fallen asleep cruel intentions is truly hell on earth right up there with war and tax audits 
wow a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever i m amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex crazed buffoons even i m offended by it bill bellamy is a player which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them what a pleasant main character one day his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player why they decide this one day i have no idea how many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn anyway bellamy agrees to teach and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women this is the bulk of the film folks guys riding from house to house one keeps getting out to have sex while the others sit in the car since russell simmons is producer and since the official title of the film is def jam s how to be a player i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy amazingly aside from gilbert gottfried s seconds of screen time there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner instead of jokes there s just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts and naked breasts aren t so bad but naked breasts alone don t make a good movie be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well gilbert gottfried s character serves as one in his very brief appearance asking for explanations as to what is being said they should have brought him along for the entire film r 
deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises and being true to its title being deceptive but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute renee zellweger their lone suspect is wayland tim roth a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker s pocket however a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ellen burstyn a local bookie kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite rosanna arquette believing his wife to be unfaithful the plot is twisty and complex with lots of lengthy flashbacks and plenty of surprises however there are times when it is needlessly complex and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost take a look at l a confidential or the film s more likely inspiration the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot for example the film tells a few substories such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable there s never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay the characters themselves are rather pathetic and despicable not one of them is an ounce sympathetic and as a result the labyrinthine plot is all for naught what does it matter who is guilty of what and why writer directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers masterwork blood simple or the wachowski brothers less worthy bound but while they have got the plot twists down cold they need to work on characterization and dialogue 
if i were to plot a graph of year against movie plot ridiculity for hollywood movies you ll probably see a line with constant gradient now if i were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael bay jerry bruckheimer has made over the last years that line would be exponential in growth the team started out with the will smith vehicle bad boys which was no more than a hr long action music video nevertheless entertaining then came the rock where audiences flocked to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing general fighting over some stupid cause con air was ridiculousy dumb in its premise but it did have fun moments and who can forget the nursery rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi while these movies worked because there was something better to cover up the dirt armageddon does not very much like deep impact a meteor is heading towards earth and they didn t realize it until days from impact deep impact settled with the modest meteor size as large as the city of new york but armageddon just had to be bigger well about the size of texas that kinda meteor whould probably knock earth out of its orbit the panic of this sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor drill it then nuke it sounds familiar and who better to do such a job than harry stamper bruce willis your very own oil driller extraordinaire and his team of macho misfits nursing the tagline there ain t nothin on this planet that harry can t drill in that days harry s group was split into teams trained for deep space flight and finally blasted into space in with special drilling vehicles on new space shuttles the main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the relationship of harry a j and grace to give you an idea a j works for harry and loves grace harry s daughter the problem is harry hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself for the rest of her life so while a j and harry struts it out grace is place in a position where she is unable to take sides so she remains seated in the nasa control tower crying over both of them in about of the movie the human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more than just an excuse for more slow mo s and gold tinted photography the anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying running for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky sounds fine right i know but it looks too out of place on screen too staged if you were to ask yourself what s the difference between armageddon and a r b music video you d probably just said the music not surprising since michael bay is a child of that industry and has actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully his foray into armageddon just proves that he doesn t when to stop well there s really nothing much to sum up here the stock aitken waterman of hollywood movies have projected their art form into ridiculity beyond the plane believability where people still accept even if they didn t believe deep impact was ridiculous in most aspects and i believe the makers know this the thing is they decided to shroud myth and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of suffering and coming in terms with ones problems which ultimately brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in armageddon is an overcrowded loud messy preposterously manipulative waste of money and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash if you have planned to watched this over deep impact because of liv tyler bruce willis or the tagline from the makers of the rock please catch deep impact before it finishes its run it may be the only meteor worth watching in long long time if you have to see it please bring ear plugs and some aspirins for the vertigo expect armageddon ld s to retail at s at carrefour come release time gee even that s not worth it 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned at the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere this highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone head to head against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion to a less potent mid august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio s lack of confidence with the picture and with good reason this is a joyless exercise of a film held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year s case study in style over substance joel schumacher s much loathed batman robin indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes uma thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit clad karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage unfortunately the same can t be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they re on board a sinking ship at this rate usually splendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days the duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture s caper esque plot when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot on english accent if nothing else it d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt the story such as it is involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption they also sip a lot of tea overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering it s clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds the avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac it s all decidedly uncompelling mr connery who s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest at least it all looks good this is a genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt in particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates by the time the film s climax had arrived my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre not coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie s remarkable trailer a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year it s everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining a crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad too polished to overlook its deficiencies there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but i sure hope not 
plunkett macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott brother of ridley and tony naturally this got me worried would jake s talent be inherited from ridley or tony if it was from ridley than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in if it was from tony it would be wham bang drivel unfortunately the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen plunkett carlyle who is poor and unruly and captain james macleane miller a clean cut gentleman as the tagline clearly wants to make known they rob the rich and nothing else the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca tyler hot on both their tails is mr chance ken stott who wants to see them both dead plunkett macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose although undoubtedly slick and fast paced there s very little merit contained in the film carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair although their characters are criminally undeveloped it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes but not on the script the five screenwriters three credited have produced an still born movie there s very little development in the story also major events such as mr cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are are so rushed that they barely happened the story is a bit of a mess frankly the performances aren t bad carlyle and miller are typical lads but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest her irritable stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on she looks nice though more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character he hams it up well ken stott is suitably evil as chance but again he is nothing but a flat character i didn t particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived although a disappointment in writing and a minor success in acting the film certainly look lavish with good costumes and wonderful sets but production design alone can t save a movie especially a movie as bad as this mess jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty with f ck this and stand and f cking deliver splattered all over the place the mtv editing and direction are flash enough but in the end decidedly empty plunkett macleane is a massive disappointment although somewhat enjoyable during parts it s so light it could float off the screen if it wasn t just images on a reel there s no thought no development no plot just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen xers although it s a great idea update a period drama to the mtv generation it s execution is awful and would more likely bore than excite sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless it s hard to recommend plunkett macleane as a movie but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video give it a miss 
to put it bluntly ed wood would have been proud of this a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor hokey drama zero logic and a crap screenplay also a beautifully anti climactic ending not to say it didn t look intriguing when i saw the previews so much for truth in advertising roland emmerich who s later independence day would look like the blows compared to this co writed and directed this inane sci fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens in a useless opening sequence men find a stone in with hieroglyphics on it it wouldn t be till present day till they would actually figure it out they re decipherer a slightly neurotic scientist nice twist dr dan jackson james spader doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare who s life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word why do they use him to decipher what no one else could so there is a hokey ending duh he figures it out in about a minute yea and then they get a suicidal colonel or something jack o neill kurt russel with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position why a suicidal colonel for the ending you ll get the hang of this they open the stargate a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad after an overdone special effects thing they re inside a goddam pyramid so they went to egypt right wrong they re on another planet that was filmed in egypt they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra the sun god the androginous jaye davidson with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma and there are fights explosions and a kiss between two people yea also melodrama stupidity hokey scenes and a bizarre language an anti climactic ending ends with stupid lines say hello to king tut asswhole the quintessential line lemme tell ya and some convenient pesudo pseudo pseudo character development by the end you just wanna go home and watch i don t know the outer limits or something the script s terrible the special effects are okay but nothing great the story s so weak that it s almost opaque the whole experience just isn t worth it unless you re so bored that you d consider watching a full house marathon or this i d pick this obviously but still it s just not fun at all and i can t wait for it to premier on mst k

gregg araki s the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus first of all some of the reviews were fairly positive also the cast consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty and david leisure was promising last of all i wanted to give arraki one more chance i mean the guy can t be that untalented can he the answer to that question is three letters long nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles since arraki doesn t know how to make anything coherent it s hard to describe the plot let s just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won t make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn t care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft he works better with the camera this time around especially in the early scenes halfway through the film i didn t necessarily find myself enjoying the film but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation then as the movie went on arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads twisted sex games and alien abductions it s sad because he almost actually had some decent material here but he ruined it with his usual in your face i m such a renegade maverick filmmaker look what i can do attitude the performances are generally better than in the doom generation which isn t saying much at least we don t have to suffer jonathan i am the most hideous man in america schaech we are however treated to another round of james i m more wooden than keanu duval sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film and kathleen robertson formerly of and now arraki s wife and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess of the tv star cameos john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture maybe greg arraki doesn t want you to like his characters maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them maybe he just wanted to piss me off if so he was successful 
i can imagine how good krippendorf s tribe must have looked on paper it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director todd holland all wanted to make this film in fact it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf s tribe as possible in retrospect i can imagine how bad this film could have been i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss dreyfuss plays james krippendorf an anthropologist who is granted by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea halfway into his two year expedition his wife apparently dies i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established later we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big screen tvs and other such pleasures so when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely he decides to construct an elaborate lie he makes his own tribe using his three children as actors in a video he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe which he calls the shelmickedmu audiences at krippendorf s lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community like all films like this the lie becomes more and more complex and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero dreyfuss is a funny talented man and he is funny in this film he has lots of positive energy and unlike most comical actors really manages to play people like this realistically this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i ve never seen dreyfuss perform and he does a great job jenna elfman who plays veronica mecilli a scientist who wants in on krippendorf s work is also very funny and appealing here and the kid actors are great as well but we re talking about the script from hell this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew no the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched furthermore the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless take for instance the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex they get all decked out in the tribe getup complete with paint to darken their skin krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe now i saw this scene coming from a mile away but i said to myself no that would be far too tasteless there s no way they ll do that oh god they did do it it s there i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn t bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film i found it deplorable and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice the film is filled with scenes like these they not only insult the audience but they insult the types of people that the film portrays it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining but i think that most members of the on screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes if i were an anthropologist this film would insult me immensely moving right along the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes sure dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny and it allows for some entertaining scenes but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case but for the purposes of good taste i would have expected something no this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues and the writer of the film charlie peters didn t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad in fact it s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing and he continually shrugs off her warnings i suppose it s important to admit that this is a funny film dreyfuss and elfman and many of the contrived and insulting scenes add up to a picture that is anything but boring and if you re less serious than i you probably will enjoy it i however can t get past these elements krippendorf s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn t be learning with a little more insight into its story and themes this could have been a good movie 
for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking or what s left of it in mainstream hollywood movie which are star vehicles are terrible things as a rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor an actor might be chosen on the up and up to give him exposure or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck generally though the actor doesn t matter and soldier the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers exemplifies this the picture lacks pizazz the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less russell plays todd a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought the movie lets us see this degenerate process but by the time the real plot starts we re into todd s later years he s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers ones who instead of being trained from birth are genetically selected before birth the pride of this class caine jason scott lee will be our villain and you know he s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie s start between the two leads less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken and it s possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction director paul anderson who helmed last year s icy thriller event horizon doesn t show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam todd upon being replaced is left to die on a garbage planet but in order to stretch the running time out the villains return to the garbage planet on a routine patrol and set the stage for the final firefight events are predictable from the time that the setups are made and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be todd fails to show physical superiority against caine in fact not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry it s not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit and treat it as a parody of typical action fare like universal soldier a strict interpretation however reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style class or substance and by next year a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television 
an attempt at florida film noir palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels it s slow moving uninvolving and plain just uninteresting harry barber woody harrelson is an ex newspaper man just out of jail after being framed for a crime his luck hasn t been the best but things are looking up when a mysterious woman rhea malroux elisabeth shue approaches him with a proposition she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get out of her stingy but rich husband felix rolf hoppe at first all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone and to collect the money of which he gets to keep but as the deed is carried out things are not what they seem and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film but the effect never quite comes together it s got the sultry florida heat seductive women and even curvier plot twists but the whole thing smells of paint by numbers sure the right ingredients are there but the end result is much too artificial a lot of the problems lie with the script which though providing some genuine surprises is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations even the plot twists don t seem to flow well with the rest of the story some of them for example come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist for example harry s spontaneous job offer or the whole typewriter situation the characters are mostly lifeless played to type but not much more woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick headedness that it s hard to even picture him as an ex journalist elisabeth shue vamps it up but doesn t add anything special to the role chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance trying to be a sexy year old but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth some of the supporting cast notably gina gershon and michael rapaport give stronger but in the end meaningless performances and to top it off the pacing of the film is much too slow as the movie grinds to a halt you re given too much time to wonder why you re wasting it watching palmetto if you re in the mood for this type of movie you d be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir

 have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment and so to finish us utterly they have now released urban legends final cut this is another scream like feature consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip offs from the most pointless movies of all time amy jennifer morrison is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university s film program where each year s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize a virtual one way ticket to hollywood success she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese loretta devine whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines soon enough fake and real blood starts to flow and amy is being chased around by scary killer while her cast and crew get slain one by one is the culprit the original urban legends murderer just some random psycho a member of the faculty one of her competitors for the hitchcock or is there something even more stupid going on this is another one of those tiring pointless teen slasher flicks neither scary funny or interesting it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain the body counts and screams continue to grow as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly in fact watching films like that after having watched scary movie is impossible keeping a serious face several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing without succeeding and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing it s the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century how many times must we tolerate the same clich s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them they are the most stupid meaningless predictable and soulless films in existence however director john ottman manages to make urban legends final cut into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in scream ottman takes seriously for that reason alone it is worth a look just to realize how bad a movie can be it s tough to find comparisons for such an achievement and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect even movies like lost in space and mission to mars seem spectacular in its shadow we have not seen such waste of t ime and resources since showgirls no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production i came up with nothing except the way the killer was dressed here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie sylvie deveu that have wisely replaced the well known scream mask with a very elegant fencing mask jennifer morrison stir of echoes is all right and the other actors best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film with the exception of its screenplay is its portray of film schools if these graduates will be the directors of the future then hollywood s golden days are over rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment let s just hope and pray that it s just an urban legend 
dear god this is a fantastically bad film regardless of what i say about knock off you can t grasp its awfulness from my words you have to see it and experience it for yourself here s the kicker though i suggest that you do so yes this is a bad film easily one of the most incompetent films of the year but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure in fact i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story don t get me wrong i m not excusing knock off it reaches an unacceptable level of badness it s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon michael wong paul sorvino and of course jean claude van damme it does however have the entertaining presence of rob schneider and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark as i watched it i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness now in retrospect it seems clear that it wasn t but it s still a fascinating kind of mess i don t like writing plot descriptions it is by far the most boring part of writing a review but in this case i m off the hook there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off for the sake of comparison i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing i paid closer attention to knock off and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray and is accused by the cia i think of selling knock off products knock off products are of course products that look like name brand materials but are generic and cheap i don t know what any of this has to do with martial arts but there are lots of martial arts in the film ray is good at martial arts so when he has to beat up bad guys there s no problem rob schneider plays his sidekick although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once in fact every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do in that order knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense but what a strange mess it is it was written by stephen e de souza who also wrote die hard and hours can this be the same man i don t see how unless of course huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time knock off seems to have an interesting premise as far as action films go but there s no semblance here for instance van damme is introduced and then seconds later he s running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong why who knows what are the implications of this i have no idea most action films abandon depth in favor of action and this is normally a problem knock off however is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut the acting is embarrassingly bad rochon in particular delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity sorvino in addition deserves better than this van damme is bad but he s charming in that bad way and so i can t say that he s hard to watch although i rarely understood what he was saying the only exception is rob schneider who is actually quite funny a lot of the time tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison they re all pointless gimmicks though such as shots of the inner workings of a knock off running shoe but his action scenes are never boring one particular piece inside of a fruit factory a fruit factory is well choreographed lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy such as our heroes first encounter with the rochon character but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous i hope he did for the alternative is a frightening thought knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania if it were boring i d give it zero stars but it s not boring it s loud and excessive and completely incoherent it s also funny even when it isn t meaning to be funny a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn t deserve to be fully lambasted i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness but i can t deny it s zany useless charm oh i know they re just action scenes looking desperately for a real story but they re fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts it s fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this but that doesn t excuse the fact that it is indeed awful 
susan granger s review of american outlaws warner bros thomas edison s the great train robbery was the first western ever made and jesse james under the black flag first introduced the outlaw folk hero now more than similarly themed pictures later jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend the story begins as jesse charasmatic colin farrell and his brother frank gabriel macht cole and scott younger scott caan will mccormack and trusty comanche tom nathaniel arcand after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war return to liberty missouri only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown and an avaricious east coast railroad baron thaddeus rains harris yulin is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value aided by allan pinkerton timothy dalton and his infamous detectives who back then were just thugs who provided security but when ma james kathy bates becomes one of their victims jesse and the rest of the guys gregory smith ty o neal joe stevens form the james younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad s supply lines sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept plus there s romance between jesse and a spunky hometown gal lee mimms ali larter working from a politically correct clich drenched sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers director les mayfield keeps the action fast paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd s cinematography luke reichle s designer duds and trevor rabin s music lend authenticity on the granger movie gauge of to american outlaws is a galloping formulaic it s the wild west re visited as a date movie 
the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film s end if you re not familiar with this law then maybe you ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film s end now if you re a regular reader of mine you ve heard me say this countless times you know how drive me crazy is going to end but is the journey to get to that ending worth it no it definitely is not melissa joan hart from abc s sabrina the teenage witch likes a hunky stud on the basketball team adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who s just broken up with his activist girlfriend apparently he wants to make his ex girlfriend jealous enough to take him back and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance so the two pretend to date for some reason but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends will this crazy scheme work do i care the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy what makes movies like can t hardly wait and things i hate about you work and to a lesser extent she s all that and never been kissed is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly i don t know what the writer s intention was with drive me crazy there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to here there s nothing just teens whining about who s going to take them to the big dance do me a favor kids go get a job or something just shut the hell up in all honesty the best part of this film is the end credits now normally when i say that it s followed with the joke because the movie is finally over in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film after the obligatory second playing of britney spears titular song there s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school nothing great but more entertaining than anything in the minutes which preceded them sci fi fans take note there are brief appearances from stephen collins star trek the motion picture and faye grant the tv miniseries v and v the final battle pg 
okay okay maybe i wasn t in the mood to watch a mindless action movie i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii even while admitting that it wasn t as good as the others howewer the latest segal picture didn t look that bad and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash boy was i wrong in the first half of the movie we are already assaulted with segal s acting he is not simply wooden he is like a wall gratuitous violence an incredible plot sexist and even more gratuitous nudity and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes by the end it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense of course in movies like these there must be a sidekick and a love interest in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model in the movie which only functions as a supposed comic relief by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie oh of course she appears naked from the waist up and of course segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship they did not even seem to be interested in each other i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie often the villain saves the movie unfortunately the villains here are cartoonish stupid and unfunny unmenacing how many movies have psycho ex special forces bad guys too many i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him the scene where we are shown the hero s superiors are stupid the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand etc simply said this is movie making by the numbers boring and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience my recommendation if you go see it bring a watch you ll be looking at it for most of the movie my rent die hard read a book stare at the sky do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen once again dragged in by my friends which by the way liked the movie halfheartedly they probably like wrestling too 
how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres isn t there a law or something this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg s dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill the plot for what its worth concerns two brothers nathan lane and an appalling lee evens who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father deciding to check out the long abandoned house they soon learn that it s worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse happy with his run down little abode and wanting it to stay that way the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue terrible overacting and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury signifying nothing the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is i hate that mouse oh cringe this is home alone all over again and ten times worse one touching scene early on is worth mentioning we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall he jumps into a tiny bed pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone it s a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film a message to speilberg if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors this kind of rubbish will just not do at all 
take a look at the following equation a christmas carol ghostbusters scrooged yes scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether scrooged is alternatively sick gross funny and then sickly soppy bill murray plays frank cross a t v executive with a horrible personality he s evil to secretary actors crew everyone except the t v s station s boss of course played by the late robert mitchum however he is then visited by a very dead exec who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts past present and future who is called the ghost of yet to come for some reason sure enough they arrive show cross how much of a s o b he is and he changes his way however throughout this simple plot we ve got to suffer outlandish special effects poor comedy and an very very mean performance from bill murray frank cross isn t funny mean he s just mean he also isn t very good at emotional scenes and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is and how he has changed however the supporting cast are ok with good performances from mitchum allen who plays his girlfriend and john glover who plays cross s partner the ghost of christmas past isn t that bad either sadly though the audience has to suffer minutes of home alone style violence from the ghost of christmas present played by carol kane whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny should be fired straight away and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait the guy with the annoying voice in police academy if i remeber correctly who thankfully dosen t say much the script is horrendous michael o donaghue churns out terrible bad taste jokes which i guess is the whole point really then changes direction completely to emotional scenes and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes which are awful the special effects look nice but do nothing for the film there s some impressive make up effects also the music is also good which is scored by danny elfman but great effects and make up don t make a great film scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience seeing as the first hour minutes of the film are so depressing anyway and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech why didn t cross just look out his exec window and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him overall then you d have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided perhaps a plague 
david schwimmer from the television series friends stars as a sensitive and slightly neurotic single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother barbara hershey of a classmate he can t remember hello mrs robinson though quite cute as a romantic comedy the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march the characters act react and interact at half speed making for one excruciatingly long sit and what s with the dreary lighting co writer director matt reeves brings some snap to the story s midsection the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for another classmate a very appealing gwyneth paltrow by this time though most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy eyed schwimmer a hound dog with a head cold who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression 
starring kiefer sutherland reese witherspoon bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen freeway is giving me second thoughts freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood only in the nineties little red riding hood is a foul mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon and the big bad wolf is a serial killer keifer sutherland to top that pathetic premise off reese goes to visit granny and you ll never guess who s waiting under the cover s in granny s bed keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented yet underrated actors and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star so what are they doing in this movie after seeing the end result undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review the answer is quite simple i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it note to keifer you wonder why you aren t a bigger star in hollywood because you keep making movies like this note to reese you were great in fear what happened this time note to both don t worry about it too much no one saw this movie anyway bottom line i m still shaking my head don t waste your time on this turkey if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie go rent flatliners or young guns reese witherspoon s abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear a great thriller do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can 
a fullyloaded entertainment review website coming soon hunter s thompson s fear and loathing in las vegas written in is already an american classic not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post psychedelia of the s but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as gonzo soon after the book was written hunter s thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas the movie although the book is one of my favorites i now agree with thompson s own assessment of the novel as unfilmable the main problem is that the book although detailing wild drug use and tripped out adventures was not written on the road it was written and edited by hunter s thomspons relatively sober at his home so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor hunter s thomspon the narrator while always drugged out still has a grip on reality and can still tell with journalistic ability what is going on around him not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped the movie is an exact duplicate of the book in terms of dialouge unfortunately this can get annoying in the form of johnny depp s who plays thompson excessive narration and the characters while having vivid personalities are played as d characers on the screen dr raoul duke johnny depp the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson s and his riding companion dr gonzo benicio del toro who is a large samoan lawyer have no personalities or emotions at all save for stoned the film is very faithful to the plot what there is of the book in that dr raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs from there one set of stoned adventures after another happens including one of the few good scenes in which depp high on acid watches all the people in the bar around him turn into literally lounge lizards while the movie has its moments few it is almost unwatchable at parts especially towards the end despite a lot of celebrity cameos the stars never get off the ground the set decoration and costumes are great and probably deserve an oscar nomination however as we all know it s not sets or effects that make a movie its the characters and quite frankly these characters are no good 
the comet disaster flick is a disaster alright directed by tony scott top gun it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble jeez after a great opening in which an american spaceship plus the city of new york are completely destroyed by a comet shower nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy they hire the world s best oil driller bruce willis and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem that s like sending a mouse into a cat carrier isn t it the action in armageddon are so over the top nonstop and too ludicrous for words i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times i was not alone plus to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor s talents the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out perform deep impact producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon 
even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material as this subpar submarine comedy proves down periscope stars kelsey frasier grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer s james coburn plan to get him out of the navy like any lame emsemble comedy the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out the fat guy who eats all the time the beautiful woman who doesn t belong there lauren holly the second in command who does everything by the book rob schneider the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out harry dean stanton and so on then comes the transparent plotline first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard after the ship is fixed up come the early drills where everyone seems completely inept like the electrician who can t connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone finally and this covers the final hour of the movie grammer has to lead his men and holly to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise and he has to be a clever rebel to do it in scenes that stretch all levels of believability first they re singing louie louie like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off then thirty minutes later they re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off the whole while evil captain coburn is overacting underwater cursing grammer as most people watching the movie probably are too it s all predictable without any original humor to redeem it the jokes are right out of mchale s navy and other cut rate sitcoms of the past there s one scene where schneider looks through the ship s pantry in disgust holds one food can up and announces this expired in i yelled back at the screen so did these jokes i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and around the start of the second hour i started writing my will the blame can t really be placed on the stars though kelsey grammer is good in this he just doesn t have anything to work with his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had welcome aboard tatooed on his penis grammer probably did something even worse got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about same for holley save the penis part who is likeable in down periscope just because she s so gorgeous as for schneider whose character is downright annoying there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas although he s still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the snl ship my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy okay it s police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster judging from the video box most other movie critics agree with me the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel s jim ferguson i guess even jeff craig from second preview who said tank girl kicks butt without ever seeing it didn t like this 
what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films john frankenheimer who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early s recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and cigarettes even charlize theron who i was convinced couldn t act did a decent job in cider house rules when all of these bright stars come together one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games disbelief was my first reaction then frustration the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar the actors in that movie were having fun and from that the audience had fun reindeer games is the complete opposite the actors don t seem to want to be their characters even danny trejo who will do practically anything doesn t look like he is enjoying himself causing the audience to quickly lose interest evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled boy this movie is horrible and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments the story follows a man rudy ben affleck who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick james frain nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman ashley charlize theron and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person when nick is killed in a prison riot rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays unfortunately ashley s brother gabriel gary sinise interferes with their relationship thinking rudy is nick he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino which nick use to work at as a security guard now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel confused the movie only gets more complex as it goes on until it gets way way too complex at its climax but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour the hero commits a greedy selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley some hero the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing a person for the audience to relate to or admire when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times the most irritating part of the film besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me 
when i ponder childhood memories past one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the inspector gadget tv show with my older brother truth be told we were rabid fanatics our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr claw the inspector s arch nemesis i was never a biggie on nostalgia but you just can t help but have fond memories of something like that sometimes i even find myself up at am watching re runs of my favorite episodes trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid at the very least i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me despite how horrid a film may be the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up so back i sat with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver let s face it exactly how good can a live action disney film really be i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr magoo and george of the jungle two previous disney adaptations and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind i was left sitting there absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world right from the beginning i knew i was in trouble in the opening scenes each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be to simply serve as real life duplicates of their cartoon clones when referring to them people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be oh hi penny is brain with you creating one dimensional replicas is one thing having mere names take the place of them is quite another the plot shall we call it stays fairly in tune with the original series matthew broderick stars as john brown how creative is that a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex why rupert everett for the love of god why who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law enforcement technology wherein he s joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form drumroll please inspector gadget from here on out the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations although to be fair my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind there s something about an evil gadget taking over the city his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon s dentures from there s something about mary and it all ends with what else a bunch of post credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself to be honest i wasn t much paying attention to these treats i was just glad that it was over 
m i the sequel to mission impossible is a james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value it tries to be a spy romance movie but without any suspense the film just looks like it s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human the coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence except for the choreographed action sequences the film was dull for three quarters of its time filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed as for the action scenes they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen m i opens and closes with fast paced action scenes but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus at that point the only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way it s a mega buck film adapted from a popular high tech gadgetry tv series but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it and it failed to produce a story that had any substance john woo broken arrow face off is good at doing car chases choreographed fights with midair flips and kung fu kicks slo mo shots of two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just can t seem to handle dialogue and suspense the star of the film and co producer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an action film girl and seems like a fish out of water in this one their romance didn t work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it wasn t convincing the film opens with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success we will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville first we are in sydney australia where a scientist with a muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain which explains the film s mythic theme as we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil the one who played the villain dougray scott does so in a one dimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role at least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out to be sean ambrose scott a rogue member of the imf which is a cia like clone he steals the package with the antidote peels off a latex mask which is a replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face off and in the original mission impossible which as convoluted a plot as that film had it was still a superior film to this sequel woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground as it is used so often in this film by both sides so much so that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard delivers via a rocket launcher a pair of talking sunglasses hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running a high gadget computer but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team he is told as an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charges will be dropped hopkins then signs off with the tag line this message will self destruct in five seconds actually with the departure of hopkins it was this disposable film that actually self destructed at this point in seville hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal and learns that she is valuable because her ex boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f ck her the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f ck him as she leads them to his hide out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh robert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes a colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in a camp way the terrorists who aim to rule the world are interested in owning percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billions on the stock ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first ethan does this rescue against all odds as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorists and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean s getting it as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle using kick boxing winning a shootout throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kick s everyone s ass if i was only entertained by this i could have lived with it but this film was so badly made that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game seeing only the slam dunks but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast in any case this is a critic proof film and will in all probability do well in the box office as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into 
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands thank you for identifying yourselves now would you all please go away your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon it isn t just the strobe light quality of your twenty cuts per minute editing or the numbing over use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised featuring the music of no it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles welcome to the club scott kalvert your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one dimensional serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole dicaprio stars as jim carroll the new york poet songwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based as the film opens jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey mark wahlberg pedro james madio and neutron patrick mcgaw one night jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine and shortly thereafter to heroin jim s addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach bruno kirby kicked out of his home by his mother lorraine bracco and drops out of school along with mickey and pedro jim becomes a victim of the street living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll s posse resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic but now with equally unsympathetic friends as a film the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale a minute long just say no public service announcement but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie but i suppose that his pseudo sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd without a character who changes in any appreciable way the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung out cohorts all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack director scott kalvert doesn t have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work so he substitutes silly slow motion photography self consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing on only one occasion when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in are any of the gimmicks effective mostly they just draw attention to how hollow the story is they also don t allow leonardo dicaprio s performance to be as strong as it could have been for every impressive moment like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex junkie who tries to help jim straighten out but kalvert won t let character interaction define this story he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting at isolate moments the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio s talents far more frequently it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like 
in the continuation of warner brother s franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film avika goldsman s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as the client is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone s batgirl who just happens to be alfred s niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little sub plot escapes me if mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth this is indeed a cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she joins with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the characters have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workman like is to be generous his best performances are still on e r bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruce s latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion as there was for nicole kidman s psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now he s just a spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batman s partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robin s attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense chris o donnell once considered a rising star successfully burns up on reentry with this performance his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking the less said about alicia silverstone s performance the better this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings us to the villains arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freeze s imprisonment the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film it s almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor ones have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it s tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows gwaaaa s and clang s associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film the special effects by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary stars of this film and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivy s lair the batcave to freeze s hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is a good director one just has to look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin comes off as a mated made for tv movie the film has no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jell o pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even with it s surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner s thought tim burton would do with the franchise kill it joel schumacher s batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately boring stars 
seen at amc old pasadena pasadena ca in sdds paul verhoeven s last movie showgirls had a bad script bad acting and a plot i use the word in its loosest possible sense that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity it stank starship troopers has a bad script bad acting and a plot that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore it stinks nobody will watch this movie for the plot but here s a brief synopsis anyway some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve armed forces at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires the home city of the main characters war is declared this involves sending the grunts who include johnny rico van dien and dizzy meyer down to the surface of the bugs planet much carnage ensues the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call more carnage ensues after being rescued their plans are changed to capture a brain bug which is believed to be controlling the aliens battle plans look i didn t write this ok yet more carnage ensues get the picture interspersed throughout all this are brief ads from the federal network which present the picture of a neo fascist state much like in verhoeven s robocop there are many problems with starship troopers the plot where one exists to drive the movie onwards is silly harris star of tv s doogie howser md is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie apparently so we will accept his ability to mind meld with a brain bug later on in addition the first thirty minutes of the movie until the characters sign up for service drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills the characters are one dimensional so much so that when dizzy is killed she says it s ok because she got to sleep with rico i had hoped that verhoeven s use of a no name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience but such an idea appears to have escaped him the dialogue is embarassing and isn t helped by the frequently terrible delivery i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species finally the fake ads become a nuisance although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii era movietone reels as presumably they are meant to their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect some people will say all of that s irrelevant the movie hinges on the battle scenes so what about those battle scenes well i admit the effects are good the bugs move about quite convincingly especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs and people have their brains blown out their limbs cut off and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways but this is my problem the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore and its continous attempt to gross us out starting early on when richards character vomits on screen verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success but fails spectacularly while robocop had a message about the importance of being human and gave the bad guys some motivation starship troopers lacks even these simple features when the brain bug sucks out a character s brain near the end of the film it s merely an analogy for what the film has done to us this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 
i ll be the first to admit it when you mention the book great expectations i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch yes it s a classic of literature but it was a rather dry one shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine certainly the experience wasn t truly that bad but to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book i m not going to tell the story the way it happened i ll gonna tell it the way i remember it anyway to return from nostalgia lane and get back to the present hollywood in it s trendy attempt to modernize the classics now presents an updated film version of great expectations instead of pip this time the central character is named finn played as a boy by jeremy kissner and by ethan hawke as an adult finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie or should that be mrs joe kim dickens and her boorish fisherman husband joe chris cooper the setting is the florida coast during the mid s finn is a blooming artist and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish one of his two favorite subjects during one of these escapades he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal robert deniro borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady deniro s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity and favors hiding on the ocean floor ok maybe that s an exaggeration but he certainly beats any of houdini s records in the opening scenes of the film and that s nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn s motorboat but i digress anyway finn does the convict a good deed just to show that he s a really swell guy and then the plot moves on enter miss havisham or ms dinsmoor here anne bancroft abandoned at the altar some years ago ms dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid with bizarre clothing eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role although she ends up nowhere near a believable character she does add some humor to the film joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner but the insane ms dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece estella raquel beaudene as a young girl gwyneth paltrow as an adult for no apparent reason other than to provide the main plot of the film finn is instantly stricken for the estella perhaps it s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before in any case neither as children nor adults chemistry simply doesn t exist between the two and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her even when as an adult finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor reacquaints himself with estella and draws her portrait in the nude there s nothing in fact there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear s gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets at this point the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella s character and couldn t care less about the two characters the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow she fails to imbue estella a remote character in the book with even the vaguest traces of humanity there s obviously something wrong when watching the film you re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character without a strong estella finn s obsession seems baseless you wish he would just stop whining let estella marry his rival walter plane an oddly subdued hank azaria and just get on with his life in fact the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot finn s relationship with his brother in law joe is interesting if a bit stereotypical what s more fascinating are his interactions with deniro although it s only a bit part it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film some of the shots work but others are too obviously staged for example both of the water fountain scenes to have any impact finn s art actually the creations of italian painter francesco clemente is used throughout the film but it mostly fails to have the intended effect we never see why finn would generate this style of art which is simultaneously crude and insightful as a result it ends up as distant as the rest of the film modernizing the classics is currently in vogue just see william shakespeare s romeo juliet simply update the action to a modern setting and apply plenty of modern rock but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it you d probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film 
lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient great acting music and cinematography were nice but too many dull sub plots and characters made the film hard to follow ralph fiennes strange days schindler s list gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy the story revolves around his past in flashback form making it even more confusing anyway he is taken in by hana juliette binoche the horseman on the roof a boring war torn nurse she was never really made into anything until she met an indian towards the end developing yet another sub plot count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger willem dafoe basquiat his love kirstin scott thomas mission impossible was severely injured in a plane crash and eventually died in a cave he returned to find her dead and was heart broken so he flew her dead body somewhere but was shot down from the ground don t get the wrong idea it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting but good is the last thing this film is maybe if it were an hour less it may have been tolerable but hours and minutes of talking is too much to handle the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography other than these the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film 
welcome to your oh so typical sequel it tries to be twice as big as it s predecessor yet ends up twice as shallow shallow hmm now there s an idea maybe if the ill fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better the first thing that struck me and surprised me was that the camera work for the opening sequence anyway was terrible looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet very different to the original movie the characters well not many of the characters actually had characters but here s a rundown annie who was the highlight of the the original must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie why because something s got to account for her losing that many iq points even though annie wasn t exactly a rocket scientist in speed here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall for instance after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can t get ut till she get s the chainsaw out of their faces bang bang bang in point of fact sandra s character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules who constantly has to be rescued jason patric all i can say is bring back keanu keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump but that s one more tree stump than jason has i don t think he changed facial expressions all movie jason smile for the cameras now frown i said frown oh you are bang bang bang wooden just doesn t describe this guys performance but it ll have to do the bad guy ahh william dafoe there s a bright move how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic body of evidence yes that is sarcasm his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn t start out too bad but goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage even though he already has the money and can escape bang bang though i d like to give this movie a double thumbs down there were some nice sequences considering the movie cost over million dollars you d hope there d be at least a couple the real eye popper for me even though it was given away in the trailer bang bang was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was completely computer generated wow i don t think i ve ever seen a cg model look so real before the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of speed this lack of speed problem affects many sequences such as the oil tanker part it was oh no we re going to hit the oil tanker minutes later oh no we re going to hit the oil tanker min you get the point this movie failed simply because it didn t live up to it s name there was very little feeling of speed in the original movie the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive in this movie it felt more like well people we re gonna run into that there island in a few hours i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i can t turn off the engines i m passing the cafeteria on the way can i get anybody anything the ending of this movie really is terrible even though it features what i ve since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in a movie it just doesn t work at all the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic but surprise surprise it just takes waaaaay too long it seemed to go for minutes before the ship finally stopped one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town around people are killed by the ship and there s only or so people left on the ship so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering the audience is sitting back and thinking wait a sec this is a happy moment because bang bang then there was the dog i almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris putting a dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche every movie seems to have a dog in danger sequence volcano dante s peak independence day daylight twister lost world etc etc this movie is a perfect example of how not to make a sequel director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie and this one back to back and see if he realises where he went wrong 
 tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid unfortunately it s not bad in the way great colossal misfires like heaven s gate or ishtar were bad instead it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it was made in the first place with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un produced how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen of course tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history he has appeared in over forty films which have ranged from the very good s greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes down to the really bad s tarzan the ape man with bo derek most of these films were just cheapie b movies made in the thirties and forties starring ex olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps therefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer a different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others greystoke added a never before seen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the mis guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek s bare breasts tarzan and the lost city on the other hand has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue the script by bayard johnson and j anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come comic books have better plots than this the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer s comedy george of the jungle didn t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established a quick opening narration tells of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage when the movie starts in he is a civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than a week however when a wicked archeologist grave robber named nigel ravens steve waddington begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africa s last great secrets the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle at first jane refuses to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape man once the film gets going in its own sluggish way it delves into a series of jungle adventures as tarzan jane and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city most of the so called adventures are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies ranging from raiders of the lost ark to the goonies when the movie is running short on action it includes a few greenpeace friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals releasing a baby elephant from a trap and throwing ivory tusks into the river the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality for instance when tarzan who was raised in the jungle is bit by a cobra he doesn t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi experienced weekend backpacker would do instead he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival of course one can t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is not to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city there is however a lost pyramid which i suppose is all the resource strapped fx department could come up with the special effects are not worthy of a made for tv movie which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid when it s sitting right out in the middle of an open field strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isn t even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van dien s laughably stiff performance comes real close this movie proves what starship troopers only hinted at he cannot act but he sure looks well groomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle van dien is much too much of a pretty boy to be an effective tarzan he s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth i also wondered what the make up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa steve perry haircut waddington makes a decent villain although he s like a charmless version of belloq from raiders of the lost ark as jane the ex model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two but whenever a snake comes into the picture she is reduced to a hysterical mess however amidst all this complaining i do have one piece of good news tarzan and the lost city is so lacking in ideas both new and old that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid so we can say this much for it at least it had the decency to be short 
synopsis valerie a high school junior who doesn t look a day under writes bad poetry complains about how much she hates school fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women chooses him as a pen pal and plays hooky to see him in court after a jailbreak the killer puts on big sunglasses wears a half buttoned jacket and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie comments alan smithee directed fatal charm which should have been more appropriately titled fatal bore or fatal crap if you find out that a film you re about to see is directed by alan smithee then you should seriously seriously seriously consider watching something anything else alan smithee is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad frankly i d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey so i think i understand why the director might have picked the alan smithee moniker for this film where to begin with this painfully poor thriller let s start with the acting it s pretty bad amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent the rest of the cast don t even though her performance isn t exactly stellar material she s also miscast she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete her scenes with valerie s mother played by mary frann are a joke the two look as though they re a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn t understand christopher atkins a handsome enough actor who plays the killer adam looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm trying to appear malicious and dangerous he wears large sunglasses and a half buttoned jacket if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead but he doesn t cut it here early on in the movie a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever fatal charm s storyline such as it is inspires more yawns than thrills the script belabors a red herring early on about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam atkins is charged with this suspect however turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film an obvious plot fault even for the idiots who didn t consider the movie s title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up so the audience must wait if they haven t already stopped watching as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn out finale the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an erotic thriller a thriller it isn t and neither is it particularly erotic i can t imagine if someone were in the mood for something erotic that he d be happy after watching this fluff a few erotic moments occur in the film they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus see they re supposed to be valerie s fantasies how creative on a personal note i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through it s no wonder why she hated high school so much as an instructor of english myself i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature a teacher would stoop to reading a student s bad poetry of course it s valerie s about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem s inspiration i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students fatal charm won t charm anyone unless there s someone that s charmed by boring lifeless insipid suspenseless thrillers if you happen upon this turkey just keep moving on

there s a good and timely story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first a new movie about the abuses of our prison system with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies a point of view but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious often nauseating camera movements and slick mtv style lighting and editing are far more important there s not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling and everything suffers christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate respectively after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial his young lawyer slater is fresh out of law school but determined to put alcatraz on trial for the abuses of it warden gary oldman the result is the usual courtroom theatrics imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students there s very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon s earnest overacting and the appropriate story there s a lot of overacting from everyone you know you re in trouble right away when r lee ermey the drill sergeant in full metal jacket is cast as a judge the center of reason and moderation slater has never been convincing and certainly isn t here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters let alone with them how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions if there s anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world it is our ability to tell a good story have we forgotten 
all right all right we get the point despite all similarities to the best selling story speechless is not based on the romance between presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin in fact the script was in development well before still the comparisons are inevitable until one realizes a critical difference no it s not that the speechless twosome are speech writers not campaign managers it s that carville and matalin s story is actually interesting speechless is a limp poorly structured would be romantic comedy speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign kevin is a sit com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate s speeches while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer but there are plent of obstacles in the way including julia s stud reporter fiance christopher reeve and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all s fair in love and politics the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they re crazy about each other screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other s arms in the first fifteen minutes then developing the antagonism it s a noble attempt to shake things up but unfortunately it just doesn t work part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do but in speechless they already know they re attracted to each other and we re left with waiting for the campaign to end so they ll admit that they love each other already there is such a herky jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king s sharp dialogue can t prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton and with those performances most of their scenes together the problems begin with their initial courtship which does virtually nothing to establish julia s character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise ass davis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit in a couple of scenes like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection for the most part however they re just actors spouting lines you keep waiting for a little spark and it never happens perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless s politics the setting seems perfect for a high energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix but that s never the tone that underwood is going for he wants a warm fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman s flute and wind musical score and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background it might as well have been a story about rival grocers and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king s previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so i had some hopes for speechless but while there is wit in the words this is a script which was probably much better on paper on screen it s still paper thin 
they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie s poster no sequel scary movie is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor and it is not because the wayans brothers shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera don t try what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof the first movie an outrageous low brow savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer succeeded because of its take no prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue familiar and popular in scary movie the filmmakers take on the haunted house ghost story format which if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series scary movie does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn of course split pea soup is the punch line an overabundant amount which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive but this pre credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original but they lack that take no prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque scary movie merely lurches from one lame sendup to another offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball and the films what lies beneath and hannibal features that only faired adequately at the box office john woo s mission impossible and charlie s angels it is as if the wayans and their team of writers at least seven are credited just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they d coalesce they don t while the pace of the original left you breathless the sequel moves with the speed of an wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road you can almost hear the reels panting scary movie tries very hard to live up to its original but it falls very short it s a dissatisfying spectacle a very weak sister of a very good movie the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is 
anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon s fact based novel the king and i and it s big expensive and soulless though good looking its lavish sets fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson s script so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting this is jodie foster s first movie since the jaw droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn t the best choice to show off her acting chops she s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens the uptight widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam now thailand with her son to instruct the king s chow yun fat son in the ways of the west because the ways of england are the ways of the world the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family kids with more in the way impressive no the eldest prince is none too happy about this father have i offended you in some way why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher but soon gets to know anna and her stern mother who loves you personality better and comes to like her meanwhile siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain s doing which arouses suspicion in siam putting anna in an uncomfortable position she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king s prejudices he though self righteous as ever can t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly quietly develop affections for each other there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king s younger daughters dies it s your classic deathbed scene with the girl s mournful eyes staring at her father who tries only semi successfully to maintain his composure anna then comes in and cries a bit the sequence was there for a purpose to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer i m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time i was just sitting there my emotions untouched this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren we never develop connections to the characters never given a reason to care this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant whose last film was ever after one of my favorites of i do not doubt tennant s ability to put together a decent movie but anna and the king aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient the sets and scenery are gorgeous but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger than life awe i liked both foster and yun fat who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles foster s generally stoic persona serves her well here as she is playing a reserved formal and rather underdeveloped character yun fat is especially effective perfectly conveying the king of siam s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations the cast is great the director is talented and the budget is lavish but this ill advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole this is an emotionless costume epic 
when the haunting arrived in theaters all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department i don t think that they are completely to blame for this movie s failure it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terrors and it was about as scary as a dust bunny so special effects or not if the story isn t the least bit scary you aren t going to end up with a very frightening movie the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern dern is always great and even though he may have had only about minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie as i sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects i kept wishing that this movie was about dern s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings on catherine zeta jones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects like the original taylor s character is the star of the movie but since she doesn t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms zeta jones their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original and let s face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta jones i ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren t in it but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients there really isn t much of a story here just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with and the special effects are great in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shots quota at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary funny maybe but not scary then we have the set when i first saw the house i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did and decided to take the idiotically overdone route this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves what part did these rooms play in the story absolutely none they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie then we have the actors lili taylor has never been one of my favorites and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she comes in around the average or slightly below mark i have no idea why liam neeson took this role he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman zeta jones was cast because she is too hot for words the fact that her character is bi sexual is just icing on the cake all catherine has to do in this movie is look good fortunately that is something she does very well while she does have a fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye candy it s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role the haunting is the antithesis of another of s horror movies the blair witch project the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film if the story sucks it s all downhill from there my advice if you are looking for special effects go rent star wars if it s scares you want rent halloween either way it s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting

a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature beams itself onto a russian science vessel well this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci fi thriller anyhow this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the virus known as man the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies the movie is that predictable the story is full of very shallow characters that don t do much other than subsist the captain of the tug played by donald sutherland makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age looks to be in his s to add to this we re shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific in a typhoon no less none of the characters seem to work together at all they are always bickering and vying for some form of control this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves it looks genuinely fake granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish also on the topic of flaws the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly why if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics should it not be able to create them move faster regardless the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it as to the actual casting for the movie finally there is nothing to complain about the actors were superb but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe watching these actors act this story out made it bearable if barely the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci fi thriller then you won t be too disappointed as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv 
fantastically over hyped godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands then an attack on a boat from some beast and finally we join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking about years old doing some research in chernobyl some shady u s government guys appear and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints from what looks like a giant lizard and what s more this beast is heading for new york gulp although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride and at some points it is there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie the main faults lie with the acting and writing common problems with summer blockbuster movies broderick is pretty useless as the hero with no humour or a tough guy image while emmerich s previous summer flick independence day had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith this has neither also maria pitillo as broderick s former girlfriend is just as useless with a chronic disability in acting she s incapable of showing emotion speaks every line in the same way and basically she s total crap it s up to french actor jean reno to save the day and indeed he does turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named animal and he adds a little life to the picture also making an appearance is harry shearer probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons as a slimy news reporter o k so the acting is not up to par but it never is in these movies but what about the script well that s not up to par either emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script the dialogue is banal broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters that s a lot of fish and the character development is non existent reno plays the typical frenchman no croissant broderick forever remains a geeky scientist also the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour the jokes that are uttered are pathetic and there s an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert the mayor is mayor ebert and is assistant is called gene ha ha ha ha the plot is dire and in the end just rips off jurassic park by having lots of baby godzilla s i e velicorapters running around new york right so the script and acting suck but what about the special effects thankfully they re are quite good godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi although we don t see much of him because the movie is so dark the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell but although they are impressive they can t save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie the movie goes on for far too long aswell and it can t seem to decide on a ending and of course the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel let s just hope one never arrives 
take two old and dying men a lifetime of regrets a house full of sins a thoroughly despicable man enough lies insecurities and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed then add a inexplicable meteorological and amphibian based phenomenon and you will have summed up magnolia the newest film from paul thomas anderson boogie nights the movie tells multiple stories weaving them together or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time would that the stories were worth the telling earl partridge jason robards a thousand acres is dying of cancer bedridden in much pain it is obvious that his time is growing short his much younger wife played by julianne moore an ideal husband is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death having married for money she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son tom cruise eyes wide shut now a misogynist self help guru who teaches men how to seduce and destroy his sexual and vulgar perspective on male female relationships is so over the top as to be utterly unbelievable meanwhile jimmy gator philip baker hall the insider is also dying of cancer not as physically incapacitated as earl jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long running quiz show which pits adults against children the current whiz quiz kid is stanley spector jeremy blackman in his film debut who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits on the other hand quiz kid donnie smith william macy mystery men would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a somebody his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug addict daughter melora walters boogie nights refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop john c reilly never been kissed even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two thirds of the movie and then it gets worse literally raining frogs yes frogs assuming it to be an intended deus ex machina device it is an ineffective one because it doesn t seem to faze the characters much oh they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets but otherwise the frog shower didn t seem to change their behavior or pattern of living or dying there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch mr anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble and a heavy handed segment of historical occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes we may be done with the past but the past is not done with us this is an absolute lie god is in the forgiveness business in fact as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset god s word says that he not only forgives he also forgets i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins isaiah kjv the spiritual one who keeps bringing up our unrighteous past is the same one who wants to keep us in a state of condemnation don t let him next time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past take great pleasure in reminding him of his future he hates that 
phil radmar jao has a hairy problem his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour he recently met the author of a non fiction book on lycanthropy also referred to in the movie as werewolfism and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs made on a pittance the film features an almost exclusively asian american cast as directed by quentin lee and justin lin the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films jeanne chin plays katherine a meek and soft spoken wife who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins real and imagined to her therapist as her husband jim clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness the picture is filled with stereotypes there s a mysterious loud mouthed waitress with a big platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she s a lesbian she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer a gay guy and the lone white with a major role the author on werewolfism has wildly unkempt orangey blonde curly hair from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist the script rarely has anything to offer the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad libbing one can only hope that the directors next film will have some substance and some credible acting shopping for fangs runs it is rated r for sex violence and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers 
this was the last carry on movie if you discount carry on columbus as a carry on movie and was made by a new production company based in central london this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert suzanne danielle to bed her husband emile the french ambassador kenneth williams when he seems unwilling she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes such as the prime minister and the u s ambassador her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead meanwhile theodore valentine larry dann is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her however she is only interested in restoring her husband s ardour which seems a little difficult after emile s accident with a church spire this film is the second worst carry on movie the worst being carry on england it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid as mrs valentine are mildly funny but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted given the script the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler joan sims as mrs dangle kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur and peter butterworth as richmond are worthless and embarassing in fact all four parts are surplus to requirements however the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades an awful script a terrible collection of jokes very poor production values especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st james palace a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score and a non existent plot or storyline its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile a complete waste of time this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies it was a certificate film but by there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april avoid at all costs 
edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back and like his previous two it is a working class relationship picture however unlike his previous work the film dwells on a more personal story and with a female protagonist and in no looking back he stumbles making a slow boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work claudia lauren holly is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life she s at a turning point in her life and feels as if she s going nowhere her boyfriend michael jon bon jovi is broke and in a dead end job if she were to marry him she d never get a chance to escape this town enter charlie edward burns claudia s old flame he skipped town several years before without any explanations even for claudia he has come back to town to see her and suddenly she is torn should she stay with stable michael and never escape her hometown or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again part of the answer lies in the character of her mother blythe danner who fell for the wrong man and has spent her life pining for claudia s father to return now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes at only a little past ninety minutes no looking back is rather short for its genre unfortunately it seems much much longer the storyline is simple and uninspired and there s a lack of energy to the whole proceedings which makes the entire drama rather tedious edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame there s no one to restrain his ego which reigns unchecked he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons yeah right lauren holly does what she can with her central character but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and we never really care bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie his acting talents are much greater than they might seem but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with there s not much to recommend in no looking back it s not that the film is bad it s simply boring there s no zest in any aspect of the film and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it 
the classic story the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the h g wells classic new line cinema armed with a stellar cast and expert make up effects man stan winston alien predator terminator etc churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel of course the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier movies one of which was made back in the and the other in the under the title the island of lost souls sounds like a much better title the story begins with edward douglas thewlis a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery kilmer after his plane crashes into the sea douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr moreau who incidently owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize his host s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau s lab when a monstrous birth was in progress even worse the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal people douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast people community which considers dr moreau their maker using shock therapy and the law dr moreau has long been able to keep his beast people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal men who are just too savage to be controlled the island of dr moreau questions the ability of men playing god dr moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp even so the production has failed to make the most out of it there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is the characters are not prioritized so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important before they know it he or she or it perishes rather ungloriously at times too perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people especially aissa balk the most human of moreau s creations the two very important characters montgomery and dr moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development i really would have liked it better if say they delved more into dr moreau s obsession montgomery s purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast people had to rebel maybe the nature of the screenplay which incidently does not incorporate much action sequences in the film forced the filmmakers to cut a long story short and make it more of an action film than anything else it s still summer and movies have to be marketable the special effects too are really nothing for anyone to shout about at most i would say the beast men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes this h g wells classic really has potential to be a good film unfortunately after adaptations they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story as a third outing the island of dr moreau accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of the planet of the apes the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv broadcast a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
there is a rule when it comes to movies a sequel is never as good as the original there are very few exceptions to this rule and texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is not one of them now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie and that this isn t even the first sequel to it you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience don t be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey a time to kill and renee zellweger jerry maguire they made this movie before they were stars judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons it s a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day and i don t blame them they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control hey don t say i didn t warn you to make matters worse leatherface the chainsaw wielding maniac who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times has now become a full blown cross dresser and spends the entire movie in drag there is a plot to this movie but it isn t worth mentioning let s just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man mcconaughey and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half witted sidekick man i can t get over just how bad this movie is this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn t enough to hold my interest for more than seconds the writing is bad the direction is even worse but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch a guarantee you if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again 
 the animal is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling it s clunky and slow like watching an wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill there are certainly better things you can do with your time actually if you ve seen the trailer then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments the story centers on bland marvin rob schneider who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer but he s afflicted with loser itis dogs attack him neighbors torment him children bully him and his co workers ignore him truthfully with his bad haircut seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic little richard and giant poodles and his unenthusiastic demeanor we d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun this is actually bad because you can t like a character if you can t develop sympathy for him we never do and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor however marvin is found by an eccentric doctor michael caton who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs as a result marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body swim with the speed of a dolphin and can run as fast as a cheetah imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation with his enhanced abilities he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him however the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn and instead marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic sexual urges goats beware he also chases cats urinates to mark his territory or growls at his enemies what he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich equally tenuous is its other running joke which involves one of his friends guy torry who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he s black it s reverse racism he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything this element doesn t work the first time it s mentioned and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence you don t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that the animal is tame if there s any reason to see this film it s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut remember her she was voted off in week of the week program survivor here she plays marvin s sunny love interest while her role required very little actual acting she seemed very comfortable even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog yuck with her adorable disposition radiant smile and playful innocence she could be a meg ryan in the making it s too bad that she s in such a mediocre offering 
inspired by the film house on haunted hill starring vincent price directed by william malone starring geoffrey rush famke janssen and chris kattan rated r contains violence profanity and brief nudity synopsis eccentric millionaire price offers to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients comments house on haunted hill is based upon the original film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price in an obvious homage the millionaire s name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have this is a pretty bad horror film yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining and house on haunted hill is just such a film it is surprisingly better than another recent haunted house remake the haunting a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b movie years old and makes no illusion that it s a crappy horror movie thus somehow it proves slightly more successful i can t think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast it is this cast which lifts this ho hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror price the main character is played by geoffrey rush the academy award winning actor of shine rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry a spiral reminiscent of ben ghandi schindler s list kingsley s ridiculous appearance in the camp sci fi classic species i don t know why but sometimes it s entertaining to see quality actors in bad movies more surprises rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure rather lamely too and singer lisa loeb appears as a tv news reporter the highlight of the cast however has to be saturday night live member chris kattan kattan s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what s exactly going on the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too house on haunted hill i suspect has just about left the second run theaters it s worth catching on cable next year if you get a chance if you have a choice pick this movie over the haunting it s the better of two evils you could say though more appropriately perhaps it d be better to say that it s the better of two turkeys 
you don t look at a ren magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning you likewise don t look at one for minutes straight surrealist works are notable for their quirks and they are fun but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died a surrealistic hyperactive comedy with no dialogue it s not a silent movie there is lots of atmospheric music occasional screams and weird sound effects but nobody ever utters an audible word though the film is distinctive its unique style wore thin after about minutes and as it progressed watching became a chore the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo legendary ed wood the man behind such classics as plan from outer space and night of the ghouls the joke of course is that his films are so bad they re good so humorous in their inanity that they become hits i woke up early the day i died unfortunatly is so bad that it s really bad it stars billy zane titanic as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around stealing a car clothes and a load of money our thief reaches a cemetery where he witnesses a bizarre ritual he falls asleep and finds himself literally in a hole with his money gone for whatever reason he is bent on getting his hard unearned cash back considering how easily he stole it the first time why didn t he just go steal some more he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don t have what he is looking for i don t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious minute short the subject and the style seem to have been made for it unfortunately twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on up to the point where halfway through i was already weary it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is i woke up early the day i died is a comedy i guess though it could have fooled me unlike most ed wood films this one tries to be funny and fails instead of the other way around there s nothing inherently wrong with that in fact i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so good at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we ll never know but in either case this is a failure jonathan taylor thomas christina ricci summer phoenix john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos ricci for example plays a prostitute her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work zane meanwhile occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature the carnival side show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no budget production it s desperately unfunny but thinks it s the funniest thing since plan it s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send off eugene novikov 
it s a good thing most animated sci fi movies come from japan because titan a e is proof that hollywood doesn t have a clue how to do it i don t know what this film is supposed to be about from what i can tell it s about a young man named kale who s one of the last survivors of earth in the early st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re generating what is left of the human race that s a fine premise for an action packed sci fi animated movie but there s no payoff the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil dredge aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights fistfights blaster fights and more double crosses than you can shake a stick at there s so much pointless sci fi banter it s too much to take the galaxy here is a total rip off of the star wars universe the creators don t bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring despite the fantastic animation and special effects it s just not an interesting movie 
jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities chan plays separated at births boomer and john ma whose drastically different paths aw forget the plot description it s not even worth the space but let s face it no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway the scenes where nothing happens in chan s films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together in the case of twin dragons however the tiresome plot driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema get to the good part already most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers efforts to hide the other s existence from their own acquaintances why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot the twins love interests demure club singer barbara chan film regular maggie cheung and lusty bride hopeful tammy nina li chi get disoriented in all the brouhaha yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with the scenes describing the boys bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot in several shots in fact even the make up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which even chan s so corny it s funny humor is off kilter in this outing some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they re annoying a case in point whenever anyone sees the brothers together they fall to the ground in a dead faint are we laughing yet as usual the final showdown is the film s jewel a tour de force display of chan s agility and grace never mind that it s not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash testing facility it s all good fun but too little too late perhaps chan s next movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies they could call it jackie chan s the final fight scenes and everybody would go home happy reviewed april at loews theaters white marsh white marsh md 
i didn t hate the big hit even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film for the entirety of its running time my eyes were attached to the screen and i never once got bored i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness this is such a confused disaster of a film that it s entertaining to watch it in the same way that it s entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl as a narrative the big hit is pure garbage never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways it s fine to mix genres if the film makers know what they re doing unfortunately writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don t seem to know how to handle the material and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy the biggest problem with the amalgamation in this case is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place but it sure is a fascinating failure marky er mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley a hitman he s a good hitman apparently although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious he doesn t snipe or make clean kills he just kicks the door down and shoots everything he works with a few other hitmen cisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine and vinnie antonio sabbato jr they re a nice bunch of muscular guys who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex they all work for a man named paris avery brooks who is rich powerful and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own this of course is where the plot comes in they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko china chow who has a rich father when they do this it turns out she is paris goddaughter it s very bad to have paris against you the story is standard action film stuff it s nothing new and nothing particularly offensive but certainly not the slightest bit compelling clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it s a john woo type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy it s true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea such as face off and the replacement killers which are both far superior there are stunts that are fun to watch the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns melvin is also very good at breakdancing and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives like i said it s not boring most disasters aren t what makes it so bad is its genre shifting madness it seems to start out as a quirky but realistic action comedy as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains then as soon as they go to their first hit it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere then somewhere in between it turns back into comedy keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl in one amusing scene she is forced to read a letter out loud indicating that she has been kidnapped but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words and scenes like this work alone but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious or not be in the film at all one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped when cisco gets there paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it but they let him out of there telling him to find the perpetrator the scene is played for laughs but it isn t funny and since it doesn t quite work as a comedy it tries to fall back on the action which also fails this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun cars land on tree branches and are supported by them characters betray each other without a second thought grenades are thrown in tight places people jump out of tall buildings and survive people outrun tumbling cars and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds most frustrating of all though is the film s definition of a hit man these guys are anything but subtle quiet and skilled individuals they re more like socially depraved militia men melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage including missile launchers and hand held machineguns the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest this obviously doesn t make for deep or interesting people to watch the acting is kind of fun though wahlberg is a good actor and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character while christina applegate who plays melvin s fianc e is convincingly air headed the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny the funniest parts are supplied by the actors and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one liners it s a true disaster one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional despite all this though i must reiterate the entertainment value here you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is you just might enjoy yourself 
the crown jewel of s irwin allen disaster movies the poseidon adventure features an all star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship the story begins on the u s s poseidon s big new year s cruise where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive let s see there s the new age preacher hackman who advises people to pray to that part of god within yourself there s the ex cop borgnine who busted a hooker stella stevens six times then married her there s the hippie singer there s got to be a morning after who turns to the company of a lonely man red buttons once her brother is killed and to round out the group the elderly couple jack albertson and shelley winters who live aboard the ship the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship everyone s in the giant ballroom at the time shortly past midnight of the new year when the ship turns first on its side then completely upside down the second in command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship in this case because the ship is overturned the top is the bottom or is the bottom the top either way we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and in the ballroom scene christmas trees thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors through burning rooms etc while the ship slowly fills with water behind them it s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at with all the melodrama that comes in between the non thrilling action scenes the one note in borgnine s one note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love although since there isn t a sex scene we never find out if his buttons really are red and albertson and winters wonder if they ll live to see their grandson s birth shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along winters who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie stevens even not so affectionately calls her fatass in one scene finally finds her purpose i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen she brags and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years she s swimming through the water her skirt billowing up around her hips showing off her cellulite or do you call it shellulite ridden thighs it s not so much funny as innately disgusting which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole 
midway through anaconda documentary filmmaker terri flores jennifer lopez turns to a co worker and says i thought this movie would be my first big break instead it s turned into a disaster truer words have never been spoken anaconda is a monster movie with a lousy monster it s a suspense film that is utterly predictable it s a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares but only in the most elementary way like a jack in the box as you turn the crank you re totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up but somehow it s still mildly startling when it happens the main difference between the giant snake in anaconda and the clown in a jack in the box is that the clown is more realistic anaconda boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe inducing robots you ve endured at disney world but it s the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame in one shot a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air the scene if done well would have been a jaw dropper here the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon what s really amazing is that the filmmaker s were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie but enough about the phony snakes now it s time to talk about the lousy story heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest stoltz tells his crew pray that you didn t forget your bug spray apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect along the way the group rescues a whacked out lapsed priest jon voight who claims to know how to find the shirishama within minutes they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness from that point on the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from jaws and dead calm one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz early in the story his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance also why did stoltz who generally selects his roles with great care agree to appear in this crap ah the mysteries of hollywood the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters lopez who starred in selena is an enormously appealing performer possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible ice cube has a special charisma an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously there s also a special twinkle in his eyes as if he s gently mocking his own tough guy posturing but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas voight plays the villain in thick accent with a series of leers and hisses spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of jonny quest at one point he looms over the crew and says the anaconda is the perfect killing machine it strikes wraps around you holds you tighter than your true love and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode that moment is so high camp that it almost made the film tolerable almost fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out anaconda don t there are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer including another alien sequel wait for them rent jaws in the meantime and don t throw away your money and time on drivel like this 
capsule the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith s films gets their own movie the gags are sporadically funny it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti gay jokes the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night and it turns out he had very good reasons low to a film needs a plot it needs characters for empathy value it needs a story and an emotional center if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are kevin smith has now made two satisfying films clerks and chasing amy with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith s fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it his remaining two films mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes penis jokes flatulence jokes film pastiches and in jokes how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call for me the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny there was not enough cleverness or variety it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay penis jokes work only so many times showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post war films including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport to pimlico jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads jay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks this leaves them at loose ends they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny silent bob being silent can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have jay has to be the comic he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before sometimes just minutes before like dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving they are excuses for gags many of which still fall flat it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content the film does not offer much to an adult audience i rate it on the to scale and a low on the to scale 
don t let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work and this movie makes a vain attempt at that any moves to glamorise his life which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness this movie about his life although well written puts too much make up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes rather than lobster and champagne oh well let s fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play write who falls in love with a beautiful woman gwyneth paltrow and from her inspiration several plays develop romeo and juliet and the twelfth night it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that s how all his plays develop but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama but i guess my version probably wouldn t draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul i think not as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie i think not in many aspects private ryan and life is beautiful were far superior movies but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar as time and again for reasons unexplained an undeserving movie will win the accolade another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead over a more polished cate but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised people will start feeling sorry for you 
the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany s in which the audience is rooting for some sweet vulnerable irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo played by sook yin lee as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild adam beach he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating ben gets emotionally involved with alessa as alessa so delicately puts it we were bosom buddies now we re fuck buddies but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee s inability to decide what she wants to be saying she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients this appears to be a high profile and well paid job we are supposed to care about alessa s feelings but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double zero i rate it a on the to scale and a on the to scale

vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family as with the other three films their two children rusty and audrey are played by a revolving series of actors this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles also back is cousin eddie randy quaid the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes in vegas vacation clark griswold chase decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen d angelo can renew their wedding vows it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn t bother to write any jokes into the script at least that s the way it looks when watching this turkey about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film since there had been none up to that point by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times and i had smiled at a couple of gags i might add that none of the funny and i use the term loosely moments came as a result of anything chase d angelo or quaid were involved in they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids who manage to have a couple of their own adventures rusty becomes a vegas high roller providing most of the film s best moments every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film which brings me to the best moment of the film the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road the theme from the original vacation begins to play christie brinkley and her red ferrari also from the first movie drive by it was a cute moment but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been and just how far that this series has fallen too bad 
capsule five friends at a stag party are involved in the accidental killing of a prostitute the cover up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends two wives and several innocent bystanders this was a real audience pleaser at toronto but it did not do much for me low to directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them one of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute several people with no moral compass they started out with a simple innocent little cocaine party and by accident look what happened they have one moral person among them daniel stern and one totally amoral person christian slater it is more selfish to let the amoral lead so they do this film is strange but not really funny or biting black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange there should be some element of satire the satire is missing here i did not find myself laughing here either what we have is a strange crime tale one just does not care what happens to these people the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation it begins like diner particularly with daniel stern and ends up like an extended horror crime comic book there are several logical holes in script if a security man goes to investigate a complaint and disappears wouldn t the guests he was investigating be the first suspects someone framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work i am desperately trying to avoid making this a spoiler popular and situation ethics get a real slamming some acting of grief is hammy and overdone more yelling than humor

i m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream but i m guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft seriously this idea a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue an example that car crash must ve been awful for everyone involved you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said just no one figured out what i know in slasher movies there isn t supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don t mind cardboard cutouts but please don t let the cutouts be so damn bland one reason movies like scream star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters aside from jared leto and joshua jackson who aren t on the screen long enough no one in urban legend makes the grade alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive not to mention as dumb as a post through of the film and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot good thing brad dourif is here but wait he s only in the movie for five minutes and he s just redoing his good natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo s nest which brings me to another aspect of urban legend it s unoriginality the film most blatantly ripped off is scream another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven s and williamson s great success urban legend tries to deconstruct modern day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films but it doesn t quite succeed it s best stab at self reflexivity is poking fun at that girl in the noxzeema ad ie rebecca gayheart we also have another killer taunting his victim on the phone routine in urban legend and quick what movie is this exchange of dialogue from female protagonist why villain why why congratulations to those of you who answered scream and or urban legend like i said this movie could ve been great if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script still at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer 
part buddy comedy part fish out of water story part nature tale meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes in fact it is an invitation you ought to disregard phil and stew deedle paul walker and steve van wormer are the twin sons of the famous millionaire elton deedle eric braeden founder of deedle enterprises elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune instead the two are careless hawaiian surf bums to set them straight he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp to which the pair inevitably go after several misadventures in wyoming where the duo is stunned to discover there s no surf the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot they arrive at yellowstone national park where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad the deedles play along phil actually has other motives the beautiful park ranger jesse a j langer who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine john ashton yellowstone has a problem it s only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs not just one or two thousands of them the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p dog menace not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater dennis hopper the brothers deedle aren t supposed to be out and out stupid like the team from dumb and dumber or bill and ted instead their brains just operate in a different simpler realm a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board a film which unfortunately this one resembles in several hideous ways the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isn t funny there s a moment when phil utters the line insert laugh here which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience the result isn t bad in a run shrieking from the theater type of way instead it s merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way the cast seems decent but they re never asked to do anything remotely interesting instead the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people and or cars rolling downhill in the forest and with constant annoying references to other disney films you ll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles 
these days we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old cult tv shows most of the times the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past but some five or six years ago there weren t that many movies and the trend didn t look that depressing so the people who like the author of this review grew up watching flintstones popular s animated series about modern stone age family weren t particularly worried when the word came about live action remake after all the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and if anything else at least the special effects would be good the plot revolves about flintstones family set in fictious stone age town of bedrock whose members enjoy the lifestyle of s middle class america fred flinstone john goodman works in the quarry and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble rick moranis and his wife betty rosie o donnell to adopt a baby to return the favour barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred and based on that fred gets well paid job in management but of course this is just a sham corrupt official cliff vandercave kyle maclachlan and his sultry secretary sharon stone halle berry need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme in the meantime fred s wife wilma elizabeth perkins must face her mother elizabeth taylor who can t stand fred on the superficial level the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life computer effects are flawless and the costumes settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show unfortunately problems with this film start with inadequate casting rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o donnell but the greatest problem of all is plot or to be precise the lack of plot some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame original characters one dimensional and many elements of the story like embezzlement and inter office politics totally incomprehensible for the little children the main targeted audience of this film result is almost unwatchable mess occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as high concept after great hype movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version all in all film isn t that bad but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it 
mugshot director writer cinematographer editor matt mahurin cast belinda becker stella michael williams rumor robert knepper joe chris robert walker random willie lassic young brother of rumor maxine joiner rumor s mother runtime mortal films reviewed by dennis schwartz a bleak indie film about a stolen identity there s not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging it falls into the category of being a pretentious art house film leaving a bitter taste in one s mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues it tries to make a heavy handed point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment with their only way out being crime but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell that it s hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean the relationship between the black mugger and his white victim is a cloudy one which the film never determines what it wants to say about it matt mahurin is virtual one man crew in putting this film together director writer cinematographer editor who is a still photographer in his day job the film works best as a visually challenging piece as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding a white photographer robert knepper is mugged by a black gang while he s on a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot of harlem at night he becomes a victim of amnesia and his head is bloodied as he s left in a deserted harlem building as the gang leaves him for dead but one of the muggers rumor michael williams comes back and pretends to help him he s a would be photographer who keeps a scrapbook entitled mugshots in the project apartment he shares with his mother and younger brother keeping his victim in the dark about who he is by calling him joe and not telling him what s happening he becomes the photographer for a few days he enters the photographer s stylish greenwich village apartment and steals his expensive camera and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds out he has a black girlfriend stella belinda becker she s the only one in the film who could act the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks as if it s a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging 
libby parsons ashley judd has the perfect little life a rich husband a cute son and a house on the ocean but when her husband nick bruce greenwood takes her sailing she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent she s convicted of his murder of course and leaves her son matty benjamin weir with her best friend annabeth gish time passes and the friend disappears with matty during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell daddy and realizes that her husband is still alive libby serves six years growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick based on the theory that because of the double jeopardy amendment she can off him with impunity when she gets parole she s sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman tommy lee jones a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident after a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty travis pursues naturally double jeopardy is a watered down version of the fugitive with jones sleep walking through his well worn pursuer persona although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train she manages to get into a few nail biters chased down the beach by a jeep chained to a car that plunges into the ocean sealed in a coffin that add some much needed thrills to an anemic slow moving script character development is thin travis intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick it s a long way to go for one line there s considerable sexual tension between travis and libby hey there s something the fugitive didn t have but it never goes anywhere libby is a tv movie everywoman but judd s intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics this is judd s most prominent role to date and she proves that she can light up the screen let s hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around the quality of director bruce beresford s movies seems to depend on luck when he has a good script and a strong cast he turns out oscar caliber work like breaker morant driving miss daisy and tender mercies when he doesn t we get double jeopardy screenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on the rock a script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites bottom line ashley judd tries hard but can t save this predictable bore

i think that saying that the x files is one of this summer s most anticipated films is safe for five years the x files television show has developed a dedicated fan culture whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of star trek fans the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal fox mulder david duchovny is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid and dana scully gillian anderson is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder s flights of fancy outlining the plot of the x files movie is virtually impossible since to be general would result in confusion yet to be specific would give too much away nevertheless i will try the black ooze and extraterrestrial virus like substance is threatening earth a shadow government is aware of this but tries to cover up the alien existence mulder and scully know the truth is out there and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover up there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie will those who don t watch the series be able to understand the movie yes isolated as an individual text the x files can stand alone they have given enough background for anyone familiar with the show or not to understand the movie although some of the secondary characters histories may confuse the uninitiated those characters are not essential to the film this is a major problem they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee why bring in the lone gunmen three computer geek conspiracy theorists for an even briefer appearance these characters are recurrent on the series and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience suggesting their popularity among fans actually most of the audience could pass for the lone gunmen still then they vanish just as quickly the television show never gives us any answers will the movie actually explain some things yes in the x files we get a fairly complete history of the black ooze what it is and what it wants we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the shadow government there are even some subtle tie ins with contemporary ufo ology including the greys and the roswell crash of is the movie any good no the x files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer creator chris carter s talents and the relationship between cinema and television first off the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched after approximately forty five minutes the length of a television episode minus the commercials the pace drops to a snail s crawl not long after that point when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series we wish he had not the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie and listening to other fans leave the cinema maybe the series too the explanations are not only absurd they are tired and unoriginal the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day note that the alien movies id and the x files are all from thcentury fox a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think the x files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people however i rather liked that about the series television allows you to impose as much or as little meaning on a show as you want it is the proverbial blank screen which we project our minds on meaning on television is open and ambiguous it is the nature of the medium cinema on the other hand is the opposite it projects onto us the filmmakers mind we can in some films fill the textual gaps ourselves but that almost never happens in an american film meaning in cinema needs to be self contained and determined so when the x files made that jump from small to big screen carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well he did not by making explicit what the television show left implicit carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill when they say that fans make a tv show it is not far from the truth on television fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there how true that is

i suppose it s unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it s release michael lehmann s action comedy was quick to win the title biggest box office flop of all time or close thereof the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk who s just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation let me put it this way he explains i never saw et greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime played by danny aiello who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences it appears as if director lehmann didn t know when to stop all the absurd silliness and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn t get goofier you ll soon be eating your words but i m inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it s box office numbers suggest it s fast paced and entertaining if you ve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor for the first portion of this review i m going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk wish me luck first and foremost bruce willis is a good sport while i m not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co wrote this script willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big fat ugly joke he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out of place which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican and their relationship escalates in interest from there it s unfortunate that mcdowell s one note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot twist and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis but now i m rambling on again about the negative things aren t i enough of the charade for the most part hudson hawk is an excruciating experience it s stupid pointless and repetitive i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater because this film really doesn t have the potential to please anyone action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of comedy and even the action sequences are skittery rushed and poorly edited and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache inducing hi jinks don t get me wrong this film is not devoid of laughs it s too bad most of them are unintentional or just plain forced the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed it s understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i m not entirely sure coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film things get more bizarre when we re introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless card flipping kit kat if that s not enough for you there s richard e grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover their crotch biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here wait maybe the only big laughs i m not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk i can t even begin to start about the film s absurd plot but let s not get into that i suppose there s some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise if they were that desperate but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it s going from minute one and from there it s minutes of pure cinematic muck 
plunkett macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking used properly it can save a movie see stigmata but it ruins this one making a muddled incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise there are certain genres that just don t go together the film opens with a sequence that i still don t understand it involves some sort of prison outbreak a robbery and a gem that keeps being eaten in any case the caper whatever it may be brings together plunkett and macleane robert carlyle and johnny lee miller respectively two happy go lucky brits with no way to make a living they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca liv tyler a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name gentleman highwaymen lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ken stott who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals meanwhile macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett who doesn t want his plans to be foiled by his partner s mindless romantic travails director jake scott son of ridley scott alien blade runner has his father s knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid jerky way that it s impossible to comprehend what s going on the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention deficit disorder edits he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut the weird almost defiant lack of dialogue there are no no conversations lasting over say seconds undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different emotionless and unrealistic when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style quite frankly blows the film has no hope of succeeding on any level i wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but i couldn t it was so kinetic it gave me a headache 
various films seen at the seattle film festival it s all true three men on a raft u s a director orson welles a recently uncovered one fourth of orson welle s planned docu drama of amazing stories around the world named it s all true this short dealt with welle s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft while several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle s attempts to film it despite studio problems a staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians sadie thompson u s a director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on w somerset maugham s story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly restored version of frank capra s lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills i was interested to see sadie thompson where the last minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen little awkwardness and a very clever script the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie s soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film or the original script the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on i cannot believe maugham s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and a half for still it s entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymore s incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds a c movie worth if you can find it the pied piper czechoslovakia director jim barta screenwriter kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate and with a lot of political comment along with it perhaps economic content is a better word it certainly doesn t show capitalism in a good light nor human nature nor anything else for that matter as you may have guessed this is not a tgif film this is the kind of film you are glad is over not that it wasn t interesting for technical reasons this is stop animation that is very well done all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts except for the animated stuffed rats boy sounds like a real comedy vehicle doesn t it add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night some gore don t bring children to this one don t bring adults to this one unless they re fascinated by puppetry and or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped blech no fun whatsoever meier west germany director screenwriter peter timm cast rainier grenkowitz nadja engelbrecht alexander hauff thomas besvater sub titled this film takes us back and forth over the east german west german border with meier an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money his uncle also in the west sneaks meier out of the country unknown to the east germans meier however is less than thrilled his girlfriend his friends and his job which he likes all exist in east germany after a round the world trip his boss think s he s on leave in bulgaria meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew s work while everyone think s he s still living in east germany of course something goes wrong and the ending is very funny but it takes the film too long to get there the humor is spread too thin and much of the plot is too obvious as is the acting still a good concept for the comedy and the last five minutes are pretty funny c the right hand man australia director di drew screenplay helen hodgman cast rupert everett hugo weaving arthur dignam jennifer claire catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie going and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival i ve learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to be wary of french comedies these people like jerry lewis ken russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as old pouty lips is probably not worth watching when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography watch out australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since weir and miller left for foreign shores finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult not impossible witness malcolm last year task well i ignored rules last night and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards it s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the s about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses lots and lots of horses the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir unfortunately said son a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident highlights include the amputation sequence the doctor s daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for a diagnosis their tender kissing with a window between them while it s raining you d think a woman studying medicine would know better the photography is good but i kept wishing for b w everything seems sepia colored anyway actually i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead but that s life grade z avoid like the plague unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks 
although i had not been a viewer of the rugrats television series i went into their first animated feature film the rugrats movie with a positive attitude the trailer looked cute enough after all after seeing it i think the words in my recent antz review in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since s the pebble and the penguin were a bit premature the rugrats movie is bottom of the barrel children s fare at its worst and starts to make antz look good in comparison as in the show the rugrats movie is about a group of very little friends ranging from babies to a three year old the head of the group tommy pickles e g daily becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill get it dill pickles hardee har har and is informed by his three year old cousin anjelica cheryl chase that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children when the other children chuckie and twins lil and phil suggest taking dill back to the hospital tommy goes along with it but on their way there they crash in the forest and become lost running into wolves and circus monkeys among other things the rugrats movie judging from the idea of being lost in the woods could have been a potentially fun family film and there were many different things that could have been done with the story so what did the writers choose to do why they set up a protracted cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall of course for the youngest of children ages the rugrats movie may very well entertain them judging from the audience i saw this with of course if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents they were all desperately struggling to stay awake and that included me for an adult the rugrats movie is a piece of garbage the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm there isn t one laugh to be had in the film nor is there any excitement if anything is even marginally good in the picture it is the bright animation style so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn t to service a more quality film the rugrats movie is doa from the start i am all for a worthwhile family movie but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful as said before young children may like it but even they deserve better than this for adults it is a nearly unbearable excruciating chore to sit through as for me the rugrats movie is not the worst of the year nor is it the most deeply hated but it is the most boring parents do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of the wizard of oz that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder two things of which the rugrats movie is completely missing 
running time approximately hr mins reviewed by jack choo rating the movie starts with a rather se en ish opening sequence rather cool and sets the mood for things to come the story propels the audience into a neo reality somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red existenz is actually the name of a new virtual reality game supposedly vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal drug in this neo reality leigh is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game experience in the form of existenz players are required to have bio ports embedded in their spine which plugs to a game pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience during a secretive beta testing cum teaser meeting for this new game an assassination attempt on life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard law is more of a realists than anything else afraid that he ll lose reality if he begin to play these games but requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt as they soon discover they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected existenz has all the cronenberg gore that is expected of him even so this film is no where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly existenz can probably be looked upon as his s version of videodrome even so it is a poor follow up while in most of his famed films his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot in existenz the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over indulgence than anything else jennifer jason leigh and jude law both commendable actors looked aloof and miss directed throughout the entire film the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b grade category it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film the opening sequence though probably formed a considerable portion of the budget which is actually quite good existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times years ago it would have been another classic for cronenberg cronenberg fans however those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you 
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as anywhere but here there isn t one thing about this mother daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives as for some reason they couldn t figure it out for themselves if the film looks familiar that is because the slums of beverly hills went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with alvin sargent s script was weak and annoyingly claustral wayne wang s the joy luck club inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn t convey pushy mother adele august susan sarandon forces her year old daughter ann natalie portman to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross country with her to beverly hills the daughter resents her twice divorced unstable but exotic schoolteacher mother bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life the daqughter doesn t even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can t stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio so it becomes a question of who knows best as the ladies fight it out between them until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner adele s dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn t look that good as she lands a job in a slum school has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there during one of many arguments with her free spirited mom they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed she runs away only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop michael milhoan who offers her wise counsel with the cop s zen wisdom passed onto the daughter she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla during their stay in beverly hills she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer a t s eliot corbin allred reader but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality as everything seemed staged and unemotional when she learns her cousin benny shawn hatosy who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn t clearly shown why she wants to stay there and for that matter it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one able to recognize mother s faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself mother has a series of setbacks like being dumped by her dream boat dentist bochner she met on the beach and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part but mother learns that her daughter has grown up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do this of course results in the corny ending showing that mom s heart was always in the right place only she went about it in the wrong way this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing 
director luis mandoki s last film was the superb serious drama when a man loves a woman but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture message in a bottle which is the worst type of romance a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before and much better so there s an absence of suspense and the film ultimately moves at such a very very deliberate pace as if it is trying to make great meaningful statements and plot developments that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through message in a bottle begins with theresa osborne robin wright penn a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and to her objection finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper soon a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks a boating town in north carolina to find out the specifics of the message of course garrett turns out to be a handsome rugged man around theresa s age and played by kevin costner she is immediately charmed by him but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there and finds that catherine was garrett s late wife who died a few years earlier do you think you know where this is headed most likely you do and i wouldn t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture s end the movie has fallen into deep artificial melodrama that i didn t buy for a second if there are any positive things to say about message in a bottle it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman as garrett s stubborn but loving father are far above par to be in such a wasteful shaggy dog love story and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast and paints chicago as an equally alluring city meanwhile costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less than stellar films that he has made recently it seems that with such bad luck he wouldn t want to make another movie set near water but here he is again with one of the main and most ridiculous centerpieces set on a storm swept sea the other actors are all sadly wasted including illeana douglas an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the friend roles here playing penn s confidante and co worker at the tribune the first half of message in a bottle plays like a hum drum trite television movie for the lifetime channel as theresa spends a great deal of time getting to know garrett with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining usually i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt written and not as if people were really talking when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other and are not particularly interesting themselves you know immediately that you are in trouble i swear that while watching message in a bottle i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater heck in actuality i m not even familiar to the novel this is based on by nicholas sparks always one step ahead of the characters the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried and true hollywood melodrama the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa s secret and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after this same exact problem occurred in last year s very very similar watch this and you will realize just how similar i mean meg ryan nicolas cage romantic drama city of angels although theresa is deeply touched by the heartfelt letter that she finds in the bottle perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own preferably before filming began it should have read memo to screenwriters use you brain 
 soldier by director paul anderson is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel s character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it and the opening scenes tap into it a little then it goes nowhere with that idea there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i ve ever seen the whole idea of the inhuman soldier type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done and it s been done much better i was able to predict the plot of the whole story which wouldn t be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting between the action sequences it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes since his dialog is extremely limited his performance in that way isn t all that bad but certainly is not enough to carry this film other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all and they generally are about as weak as their characters but enough of this stuff about plot and character right isn t the most important part of an action film well the action even in this aspect the film is a disappointment in mortal kombat director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining however he fails to repeat that in this film the combat scenes particularly the big one at the end is incredibly unimaginatve fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with it goes for the old shoot em up one guy vs an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the s if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film however it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that making the film a big disappointment 
the most absurd remake of it s a toss up between gus van sant s psycho and mighty joe young the new disney picture based on the old rko picture i knew i was in trouble when a polished computer generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits there is no great demand for another giant ape movie make that ape movie period witness the quick deaths of buddy born to be wild and congo and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable it s also an assembly line product through and through lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it theron is jill young as a young girl in the wilds of africa she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers that baby gorilla nicknamed joe grows to immense proportions and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers enter conservationist greg paxton who convinces jill to move with joe to california where they can protect him better in a controlled environment joe is restless at first no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l a plotting joe s demise suffice it to say the movie could have been called joe ape in the city theron so good in devil s advocate and paxton so good in the recent a simple plan are fine actors but not fine enough to transcend the material a paint by numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg s the lost world than the original with the computer generated t rex i mean joe wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third with jill shouting look joe s headed for the movie theatre followed by a shot of joe scaling mann s chinese theater a moment later jill shouts again something like look joe s headed for an amusement park and what do you know there s joe at the pallisades carnival scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers the seams of last minute edits to mighty joe young show unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves the movie sure feels uneven regardless act two is underdeveloped while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long long way underwood tremors speechless was perhaps not the director for the job even the plentiful untamed landscape looks dull in his hands capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style i did enjoy certain sequences especially the demoliton of a black tie dinner sequence and the prologue however implausible is touching as a tyke joe acts just like e t rick baker s make up effects and puppetry are outstanding the real star of the show yet for all its technical flawlessness the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love his facial expressions are variations on a scowl to be fair i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children it s a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue it s certainly not a film for very young kids intense fighting scenes may scare them while any time joe s not on camera may bore them to tears note older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron s colourful array of tank tops i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing but they sure don t make em like they used to 
michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky goofy best friend to jeff daniels lawyer character in this ill fated and unfunny comedy plot richard the actor richards has to take the place of charles the lawyer daniels in a real court case after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery critique this movie did not make me laugh once perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it perhaps perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld perhaps perhaps it was because the movie just wasn t funny absolutely the lack of humour wasn t the only issue that i had with this film either the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision but unfortunately they are also lacking in conviction believability and credibility they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake the actors were all adequate enough in their roles but the problem didn t lie in the acting i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time but i can t unless of course you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house overall this movie stinks on the good side charlize theron is darn cute and the movie is no longer then minutes on the bad side this movie is not funny interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible a person wouldn t even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness please skip it little known facts jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge before becoming an actor director charlize theron grew up on a farm outside benoni south africa as the only child at the age of her mother made her go to los angeles to try a career in the movie industry she came to la without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on hollywood boulevard an agent gave her his card after eight months in la she got her first part since then she has taken acting lessons and her career has skyrocketed specifically in devil s advocate charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the movie showgirls she was quoted as saying it was like i had some guardian angel 
we re back in blade runner territory with this one conceptual artist robert longo s vision of a william gibson inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for front and center is johnny keanu reeves a cyber courier who smuggles data via a wet wired implant he s ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long term memory restored but first he has to finish one last dangerous job the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed he s walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins ice t and dina meyer dolph lundgren s street preacher is in an acting category all its own without a believable performance between them all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere which is pretty good in places the vr sequences are way cool but the physical fx such as miniatures and mattes leave a lot to be desired watch out for those bad blue screens we wouldn t mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better too bad the debut director isn t very strong in this de partment his big finale is a sloppy silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long which is way past the time that most of our wet wired processors have already shut down bottom line yatf yet another tortured future skip it 
plot token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film trio from the studio after they complete the final cut without him he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision critique wow i really can t remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels the comedy in this film is pathetic obvious and dated oj simpson jokes galore the plot is uninteresting boring and bad the structure of the film is annoying repetitive and pretentious the acting is pretty bad especially jackie chan who can t act to save his life the cameos are lame and seem forced and the ending blows chunks all in all this movie believes itself to be a clever humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood but comes across as a boring stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans but this one bites the big one see it if you like to watch really bad movies otherwise skip it because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it luckily for us all this mess only lasts about minutes and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead faced detective by the way is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn t have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over who knows who cares this satire sucks the bag little known facts about this film and its stars ironically the original director of this film arthur hiller also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga s alan smithee moniker this was after the film s production company cinergi pictures preferred the cut made by producer writer joe eszterhas to his the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis eszterhas announced through the media during post production that cinergi pictures didn t have the money to pay for soundtrack he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him he received cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists listened to all that was sent at least a couple of tracks from each record and compiled the soundtrack this film practically swept the razzie awards in given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year with no less than the worst picture award the worst screenplay joe eszterhas the worst supporting actor joe eszterhas the worst new star joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer and the worst original song i wanna be mike ovitz as written by joe eszterhas 
ever since wargames the first real computer hacking movie hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous if it s not this the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect hackers is guilty of all of these crimes to anyone familiar with computers and or the internet most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can t take it anymore those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web the internet movie database are probably aware of the section for movies entitled goofs this is the section for mistakes in the movies well imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed generally ill informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology and truthfully this is one hundred percent correct the plot obviously centers around computer hacking more specifically it follows the exploits of dade murphy a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting because if it were not for that who knows where his career would be now after hackers the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old the film then picks up at that point an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn angelina jolie cereal killer matthew lillard lord nikon laurence mason and the phantom phreak renoly santiago who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi oh and as a little sub plot dade also tries to woo acid burn the only female hacker in the film really i can t think of much more to say about the film s plot aside from what i ve said it s just a bunch of computer geeks no obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi thanks to this movie the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list to sum it up hackers is a terrible computer film if you re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world i suggest sneakers although at times it too may seem a little far fetched it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users hopefully this film didn t influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this minute waste of time 
this is the worst movie i ve seen since the so bad i walked out on it jingle all the way it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap it is crap through and through nothing works in this film as to be expected from joel schumacher who has made only one watchable film in his entire career that being cousins here s a man who admits he s a medicore director a rather charmingly self effacing statement but truth be told he is much worse than mediocre not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again there is no plot anywhere and the dialogue is unrelentingly shallow preposterous and boring they set up mr freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one liners it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death but that s par for course nothing in this film makes any sense including half of arnold schwarzenegger s lines as mr freeze arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once this is the same problem he had in jingle all the way and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass personally i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn t retake scenes to make him understandable compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in batman robin apparently james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold uma thurman is not as bad but nothing resembling good either her poison ivy vamps around terribly chewing up scenery left and right and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub snl standard acting as if she s reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment given the script it s a wonder it didn t happen more frequently there is no redeeming feature in this film not george clooney as batman chris o donnell as robin nor alicia silverstone as batgirl michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance in fact there was something unsettling about his appearance which seems to have been accomplished without any make up tricks looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man unfortunately every scene about alfred s sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance they just go through the motions losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle you know there s a bunch of people but instead of a melee schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist there s never a moment of awe wonder or mayhem the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects which are impressive and probably expensive even then the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable the hockey team from hell not even the tv series got that stupid at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that batman robin showcases frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do blink and you ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison vivica fox as a why is she even in the film vamp in freeze s lair with all of two lines and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs fries she isn t even filmed well enough to look good trust me she s quite attractive outside of this dreck and as if the film weren t bad enough to limp along with bad direction bad dialogue bad performances and bad fight scenes there are inconsistencies and illogic galore i know it s nit picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs why the character s arms aren t ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet while holding on to another person no less or where the moisture comes from when freeze s weapon creates tons if ice that s all traditional comic book stuff but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by standers why is there a big switch clearly marked heat in mr freeze s lair why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr freeze hand to hand why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her why do batman robin take minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones why don t they wear masks to filter it out i could go on and on batman robin is a braindead pointless garish loud film that should still reign as the worst film of the year by the time rolls along note to warner bros if you re going to make another batman film please replace schumacher with nearly anyone because it could actually get worse than this what schumacher does not understand is that comic book doesn t automatically equal unbearable idiocy the true equation seems to be

plot a separated glamorous hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together kewl now i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie critique trite unfunny boring and a waste of everyone s talent how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn t feature any chemistry any real laughs any surprises or any spice is beyond me how julia roberts is used solely as a puppy dog character puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta jones character who is not one bit funny or romantic two ideal ingredients in a romantic comedy is also beyond me and why they chose john cusack a great quirky actor in his own right to play the most bland uninteresting and unfetching character with zero chemistry with either of his leads is further more beyond me and to anybody who decided that this project was funny enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above along with billy crystal christopher walker seth green and stanley tucci well what can i say i just don t have the words so is this the worst movie that i ve seen all year no but it definitely sucks and it s basically because well it s just not funny and for the record allow me to state a few more problems with it it starts off slow it s got no energy it doesn t engage you with any of its characters julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film everyone else lame it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward it s utterly predictable standard routine see through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen big and ugly waiting waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing and then hank azaria shows up aaaaaah the film s savior mind you some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype but that s another story altogether but when an experienced voice actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer blockbuster romantic comedy with an over the top antonio banderas accent damn dude your film s in trouble rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences huh the idio plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax but everyone believes that he s going to kill himself hardy har har and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie well i could go on but i won t because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria green and tucci s antics from time to time ironic eh what about the leads dammit and liked the premise behind the film before i saw the finished product of course a dud all the way around btw all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene her character is supposed to have lost pounds so when the scene finally came i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then well it basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit ugh i think i m gonna start drinking again after this lame ass movie c mon hollywood enough with the crud where s joblo coming from beautiful my best friend s wedding notting hill pretty woman runaway bride someone like you wedding planner when harry met sally you ve got mail 
hollywood never fails to astound me every time i think those coked up little buggers have hit rock bottom they come up with a new excavating tool i was truly convinced that wild wild west marked studio filmmaking at its most hapless but then along comes end of days to prove me wrong this big budget brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music grisly violence explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects the result nothing but groans and yawns even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept at the very least end of days should have done us the courtesy of being bad enough to be good but it can t even manage that it s just lousy arnold schwarzenegger still recovering from heart problems and batman robin plays an ex cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something along with his obligatory comic relief partner kevin pollak impersonating matthew perry s chandler character from friends he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo it seems that satan gabriel byrne gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years and here i thought he d pulled it off with the republican landslide of if he has sex with year old christine york robin tunney the chosen one their child will be the antichrist or at least a brat ah but this deal has more catches than a new year s eve pass from a halfway house the unholy union must take place on december you see is just turned upside down but only between p m and midnight no wonder this guy is so cranky and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church the devil won t know where she is because he can t see into the sanctuary you know it s kind of like superman s x ray vision and lead walls only evil a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan if you ll pardon the expression and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own oh the anguish oh the humanity oh the writing andrew w marlowe s screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane schwarzenegger s character cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first lethal weapon preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter twenty minutes later he s racing through the bowels of new york city deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling when cane meets up with christine york he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter in case anyone misses the connection the camera comes in for a close up of christine s music box which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane s daughter subtle marlowe subtle speaking of cameras director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe s script and make it even more self important murky and annoying hyams direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces punctuated with loads of big explosions eager to satisfy arnold s core audience he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well what a guy had the film delivered some decent scares or even maintained a consistently ominous tone the bombastic clich s might have been tolerable but end of days is simply a flaccid special effects show the cast is just as ineffective in his early scenes gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster kevin pollak comes and goes quickly robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold well he s a better actor than casper van dien that should count for something way back in the aftermath the exorcist and the omen supernatural swill like end of days might have passed muster as a b movie but that was then and this is now the x files and buffy the vampire slayer deliver real scares on a weekly basis and if we want to see the devil all we have to do is flip on the club and take a gander at pat robertson s grinning maw after enduring end of days all i can say is get thee behind me satan and while you re at it get thee a better agent as well 
well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you because thats all that there really is i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot for one thing a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity i am not saying that this isn t possible but it does leave one to wonder i know i did another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations there was one scene that should have been short but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking ok enough already get on with it there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning this movie is also very predictable you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated it gets boring at times to tell you the truth even though there is still action going on another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero some of the characters are not proper for their roles the acting is fine but the characters just don t seem to add up if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn t rate this movie too highly but that s just the thing this movie isn t just the plot its the whole package and this package is really well done the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie the special effects are just amazing you can t tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn t be able to say that the creature wasn t there during filming extinct or not another thing is the destruction scenes wow those were masterpieces well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino s make this one of the reasons to see this movie this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me one little side note although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid there were theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made i thought i d put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this 
two party guys bob their heads to haddaway s dance hit what is love while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub it s barely enough to sustain a three minute saturday night live skit but snl producer lorne michaels clueless creator amy heckerling and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution s recurring roxbury guys sketch that would presumably make a good feature emphasis on the word presumably a night at the roxbury takes an already thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point and that of viewers patience levels the first five minutes or so of roxbury play very much like one of the original roxbury guys skits with what is love blaring on the soundtrack the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi chris kattan and will ferrell bob their heads scope out hotties at clubs and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts there is one crucial difference however these guys speak that little fact has been used as justification for the film s existence that the butabis newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren ferrell and kattan are new that s for sure but they all lead to comic dead ends there is no story per se only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots the brothers literally run into or rather get run into as in by car richard grieco of jump street fame and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club there they meet a hotshot club owner chazz palminteri conspicuously uncredited can you blame him who takes an interest in an idea of theirs meanwhile the bros overbearing father dan hedaya wants them to stop clubbing when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father a rift is created between the two the narrative messiness of roxbury would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny but virtually none of it is the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end alas the joke a rather lazy takeoff on jerry maguire will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film granted a lot of people have seen jerry maguire but the fact that the film s best joke is completely dependent on one s familiarity with another film says a lot about roxbury s lack of inspiration that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of saturday night live the roxbury guys is a one joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context after watching one of the roxbury skits on snl this is what you come away with from the characters they bob their heads to what is love bump unsuspecting women and that s all after watching a night at the roxbury you ll be left with exactly the same 
deserves recognition for achieving the near impossible task of making a grander monument to self love than steven seagal s on deadly ground capsule review a question after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld what in the were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another post apocalyptic movie thinking in this hour advertisement for his new hair weave costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employee s uniform and gradually turns a nuked out usa into an idealized hippy dippy society judging by the costuming at the end of the movie the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re inventing polyester when he s not pointing the camera directly at himself director costner does have a nice visual sense and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust no one s but by the time the second hour rolled around i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes mark this one return to sender 
one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish and one of his best was his last film lone star after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us mexico border expectation ran high for his next film unfortunately his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do then the film does exactly what it promised a painful as that is the plot of men with guns can be summarized in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas dr fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went and he found out again and again and again of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians but the film talks down to the viewer dr fuentes played by federico luppi teaches medicine in the capital city of his country he has as a great humanitarian gesture trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others the student tells him the others are still in the mountains but suggests that it may not be a good place to be fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general the results are little different than one would expect dr fuentes starts out incredibly naive even some american tourists present in the film mostly for comic relief seem to know better than dr fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was sayles certainly could have used minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer 
a number of critics have decided that it s open season on freddie prize jr slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound alike disposable teen fluff like head over heels boys and girls down to you and she s all that while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend his talent is not i first saw him in the independent dark comedy the house of yes where he gave a subtle impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america s freakiest families prinze has the acting chops he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown up movies to show the non believers that he has what it takes summer catch certainly won t help his case inoffensive but utterly generic the baseball related romantic comedy does little more than kill time the story deals with the love affair between tenley jessica biel a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan prinze a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big time baseball star ryan s preoccupation with his new honey bunny drives her elitist father bruce davison crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team it s a wonder the kid has any time to pitch as his time is occupied with making out with tenley fighting with her dad bonding with his own dad fred ward who deserves better than this fighting with his brother jason gedrick and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky character heavy baseball movie like bull durham but haven t got a clue how to get there and so they glide from one clich to the next for minutes the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center fielder from texas in an early barroom scene blucas best known as demon fighting riley finn from buffy the vampire slayer hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states he does have a nice ass a bubble butt when lillard gives him an are you insane look blucas calmly says it s nothing sexual then goes on to evaluate the hind ends of some other players including lillard s speaking of asses prinze does not bare his in the movie the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract so two stunt butts were employed for a couple of semi nude shots blucas whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story gets another unique moment late in the film sick of hearing teammates make fat chick jokes he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply sized ladies while his speech still ends up objectifying women it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie trivial tidbit summer catch marks a scooby doo summit marc blucas appears in jay and silent bob strike back as fred from the scooby doo gang while freddie prinze jr plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon 
 from the director of the nightmare before christmas it said in the previews which i m guessing was said to get people to go see the movie obviously it hasn t worked since the million dollar movie has yet to break million to each it s own however since monkey bone is not only a bad movie all together but technically well made a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena monkey bone a crude comic strip that everyone wants to merchandise they go to great links to get it as well including dollars that let out fart powder when stu and his girlfriend julie bridget fonda are in a freak car accident you ll see stu goes into a coma and while in his coma stu travels to i m guessing dark town where all the characters in dreams come to life people are stuck in this town with their nightmares roaming around them when stu spots monkey bone whom he really can t stand he tries to keep him under control making a new friend kitty rose mcgowan he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death he can go back up and live his life when monkey bone and stu steal a pass monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu s body now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder so everyone has nightmares or something like that rather complex in fact more than it needs to be monkey bone had potential in the script and even the story what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes and lack of character development for instance we really don t get to know who stu or julie are so why should we even care kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her but we are not given a chance to know her the cast is decent however brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt her performance is bad and she seems miscast dave foley isn t given enough to do as well as will grace s megan mullally who can be funny the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust the special effects of monkey bone is what might really bring in some curious viewers these special effects are highly effective and nice to look at with the eyes some of them are believable and some unbelievable for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little you really don t realize that he is animated but on occasion it sneaks up on you the direction by henry selick is good but at times he doesn t know what kind of film he wants to make and the ending climax falls off the cliff it s too bad really monkey bone could have been a real good movie but with it s heavily done hack job and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role for those curious however it might be worth the rental but other than that avoid this one 
i ve got to admit it i m a huge jim carrey fan i loved the first ace ventura as well as the mask and dumb and dumber and even in batman forever which was a pretty awful movie carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good until i saw ace ventura i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying sadly ace ventura shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie but this time it is no longer funny it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and if not returned in four days will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other once again it s up to ace to save the day using his uncanny detective skills those who have been disappointed by carrey s more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over acting to the best of his ability but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn t capture the feel of the original the original benefited from what looked to be carrey s constant hyped up improv sequences which were hysterically funny here however the tighter script which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies takes the improvised material from the first and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie giving carrey little chance to improvise instead his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself in the first movie he was always cool and one step ahead of every one else perfect for carrey s off the wall approach but here ventura is made to look a lot stupider and is often made out as the straight guy a role which is definitely not carrey s style there are definitely some very funny moments but they are few and far between they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura or even dumb and dumber 
ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his or her sophistication it s full of stops and starts and usually the punch line is ruined i felt the same way watching drowning mona skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy there are some slightly successful attempts at humor but they only serve as window dressing there is a running gag about the town verplanck n y being a test town for the then new yugo everyone drives a yugo differentiating their cars with personalized license plates even the police chief drives one there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets there also is a running gag about one of the characters jeff missing a hand and how it occurred it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend there are some sight gags that pop up as well such as mona s tombstone which reads demoted instead of devoted still the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona midler each scene with her is the same scream at someone hit someone then scream some more there s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness anyone off the street could have played the role such as it is the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization there is a burly female car mechanic so of course there is a forced lesbianism gag mona s son jeff marcus thomas is a simpleton hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth chief of police rash devito likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter there s nothing more to him elle the chief s daughter campbell is bland personified a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married mona s husband phil fichtner jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch bob affleck elle s betrothed and business partner to jeff is a mumbling obvious dullard there is no contrast to any of the characters by having at least one character with some wit or wits to serve as counterpoint to the others perhaps steinfeld s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better ostensibly a murder mystery drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer who could be anyone due to mona s loving manner with everyone on town even that aspect of the film fails throwing in a convenient ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things it s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it s ineptitude 
spoiled rich kid kelley morse chris klein receives a new mercedes for a graduation present he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because he s rich and they re not he ends up provoking jasper josh hartnett into a race and as a result the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family s barn jasper s girlfriend sam leelee sobieski soon takes a liking to kelley however despite the fact that it was her family s diner that was destroyed and b all kelley does is sit around sulk and smart off to the townspeople but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless that s apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people in the speech kelley quotes a poem by robert frost which just so happens to be sam s favorite poem as well awwwww soon they re frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town especially jasper s best friend see them together kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town especially when he shows up at the town dance drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper kelley runs off and decides to leave town sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her and sam without even breaking stride basically says see ya and takes off to boston with kelley here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around its completely worthless chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers and it s because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place however not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both i shouldn t have such feelings towards people i like but their characters are so infuriating that well trust me you ll feel the same way even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two simply because his jerkish actions are calculated he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it jasper on the other hand only reacts to kelley s provocations and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions but as in life nice guys finish last for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film s only sympathetic character gets completely crushed then a cancer subplot comes into play where things get even more infuriating if you can imagine that what things weren t depressing enough for you mr screenwriter who greenlit this project who on earth thought this would entertain anyone perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people but even after he s destroyed these people s lives he continues to be a snob to them and ruins one more for good measure here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of and is enhanced for x televisions extras include jessica simpson s music video for where you are a commercial for the film s soundtrack which by the way is the only good thing about the film the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots trailers for other fox releases anna and the king anywhere but here the beach drive me crazy ever after romeo juliet simply irresistible as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine nothing that will challenge anyone s audio video systems of course fans of this movie if any exist should enjoy the dvd release here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film it is merely a waste of time money and talent 
 america s sweethearts has an intriguing premise and a great cast but it isn t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co script writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co hosting comic relief charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg two other paragons of self indulgence crystal ignores a simple but crucial rule for a screwball comedy to work the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous america s sweethearts takes place at a press junket where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters it s a promising set up but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules thus dissipating the tension of the situation by the end of the film all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed john cusack and catherine zeta jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector hank azaria a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together six crossed the million mark but the prospects for their final effort a space opus titled time over time are far from rosy while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup gwen s solo films have tanked to make matter worse the director of the movie christopher walken a visionary who purchased the unabomber s cabin and had it moved to his backyard is withholding the film from the studio insisting that the first screening be held at the junket desperate to win over the press the studio elects to hire lee billy crystal a recently fired publicist to salvage the situation lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation he enlists the help of kiki julia roberts gwen s sister personal assistant and whipping girl what lee doesn t know is that kiki is in love with eddie a fact that could temper her effectiveness press junkets are a haven for control freaks studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel with food and drink always at hand generally on the evening of their arrival writers are bussed to see the featured film then ferreted straight back to the hotel the next day writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews every minutes or so a producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free to ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes a question they may not be invited to future junkets representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew with the studio filming the exchanges the reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars but to play it safe the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit the junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas for most of the film the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press when they do deal with journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is de clawed gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected with the film goes nuts all without any repercussions lee certainly isn t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors hell no they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie all of which underscores how billy crystal and co writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in america s sweethearts is based on barely in control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it doesn t matter because any publicity is good publicity and thus the very set up for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter so what about the cast julia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit and not a very convincing one by the way catherine zeta jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic by casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks in supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad seth green is amusing as a toadie stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair though he has little to work with come to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie as a hollywood satire america s sweethearts is toothless as a romance it is at best a minor pleasure such a good cast such a waste of their efforts had it not been taken long ago a better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing 
chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from you either find his helium voice crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying i think i fall into the former category i m one of the few who thought his turn in the fifth element as a prancing prince like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating but his new vehicle money talks just doesn t do him service tucker is good in the movie and this is the kind of film that if people see it could make him a big star but he s also really the only thing good about the movie in fact if you see money talks it should shock you beyond recognition that two of toy story s writers penned the sloppy script tucker s role here is that of franklin hatchett a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell charlie sheen after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard gerard ismael but villard s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist franklin is allowed to escape as well but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that for some reason or another is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo the local media mistakenly puts the prison break out blame on franklin which is where james comes back into the picture he makes a deal to protect franklin if in turn franklin gives him an exclusive interview this means james must present his new friend in the stickiest of situations a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace heather locklear also attended by her uber rich parents veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james this ain t no buddy movie claim the print ads yeah right actually for the better part of oh minutes it appears money talks has the momentum to cover entertaining ground and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker this is tucker s first leading role and if you imagine a slightly lankier african american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r rated raunch rather than pg physical comedy you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role but you realize all too quickly that tucker s overstated liveliness is the only thing money talks has going for it and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make it s all too easy to pick out everything wrong with money talks the plot is recycled buddy buddy comedy thriller tripe that seemed overused even when nothing to lose employed it last month everything is paint by numbers especially the los angeles coliseum finale which finds not one not two but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers the villains as many as there are are dull certain story elements are too coincidental and too much of the film s dramatic agenda is played too straight a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin s true identity you brought a killer into my parents house is extremely silly you get the picture obviously i did not have a pleasant experience at money talks but the people around me appeared to be having a rip roaring good time one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health but tucker at least for me is a pretty funny guy and aces the movie s best scene where franklin passes himself off as vic damone s son at james and grace s engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics tucker s audience and he does have one will probably like money talks those who he irritates however will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails 
adam sandler isn t known for appearing in deep thought provoking films but he s still a really funny guy most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler s comic performance and it s a miserable failure sandler plays a thirty something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy played by cole and dylan sprouse as one might expect from the synopsis director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say good bye to one another in addition there s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself there s a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters and the film features passable performances from sandler joey lauren adams as the love interest and the two young boys but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny 
janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker this is a by the books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs it also jumps on the ever popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there too garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator jay o sanders running for reelection denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that s made the kennedy family so popular so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit she soon learns why easier said than done is the mantra of movies like this the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland almost misses the bus to town can t get a hotel room ends up in the smallest trashiest one around has a dog piss on her luggage and so on then comes what roger ebert calls the meet cute it happens in every romance the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional cinematic way in the matchmaker it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean david o hara in the bathtub his dog sitting at his side no points for guessing it s the same dog that just made water on her luggage also no points for guessing garofalo hates o hara on sight that s how it works in movies like these i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she d hate him for awhile then succumb to his charms live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil after which they d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits i haven t mentioned the movie s twist yet garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss milo o shea who looks like an irish tom snyder is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together rest assured he ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o hara oh and in keeping with the matchmaker s utter predictability he dies toward the end what the message here sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction like garofalo will sell out with a weak script i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie but they actually only have two or three scenes together leary stays stateside for the most part yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole he even undoes himself with the old microphone s still on after he s done giving the speech cliche both of them should have known better 
i want to be involved in show business one day and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse this movie proves it for me i was a little worried about the last batman film as i thought joel schumaccer taking over from tim burton would screw it up i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne they didn t kilmer did a good job and the cast was left to carry the movie which they did even jim carrey as the riddler and i can t stand jim carrey because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles this film is different the cast is still impressive but here not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction he s one of those directors who s good with actors terrible with camera angles but writer akiva goldsmith doesn t really give an impressive cast anything to do the cast is impressive clooney is a surprisingly good wayne batman o donnell is a crafty robin as usual they could ve casted somebody better as batgirl my friend likes neve campbell but silverstone is not bad and thurman is a good poison ivy the major problem is schwarzenegger who is a terrible freeze his accent is so heavy you can t understand what he says and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act and they know it but they figure that if they flex their muscles say a limited amount of stuff and kill a bunch of guys then they figure nobody ll notice that s the trouble with me i notice schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney or as much money as he got for this but hollywood thinks he does patrick stewart was the person i d heard that was considered to play freeze and he would ve been so much better or sean connery but not arnold i m not an actor but i play one in real life schwarzenegger i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film but it would ve been nice if they d casted a star that had talent for the role akiva goldsmith s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film in a regular batman film they d concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more but elle macpherson s julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is there is talk of a fifth batman movie my interest to see it is low but i hope it s better than this if you don t want to waste your time rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster any other 
plot based on the wildly popular jerry springer tv show this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program one posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the i slept with my stepfather segment and the other is based on some fly girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted dog boyfriend critique the truth is that if i didn t have a day job i would probably watch the real jerry springer show every day i find it quite entertaining despite its complete lack of redeeming value having said that the show itself is outrageous funny and always filled with goofy surprises as opposed to this film which features no laughs is this a comedy or a drama uninteresting and completely unbelievable one dimensional stereotypes and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way i never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer but this film is an absolute yawn fest despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs lesbians t a and tv violence who would ve guessed that i wish they would have either a made this movie much much funnier or b turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment unfortunately it doesn t seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real jerry springer reruns to complete his script leaving us with a boring film featuring no laughs one dimensional characters and no fun whatsoever little known facts about this film and its stars jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati ohio for this film he won the razzie award for worst new star tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film burn hollywood burn 
it s now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james jennifer love hewitt best friends still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown she can t concentrate on her schoolwork can t get a good night s sleep and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club everywhere she looks she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand in the first movie i know what you did last summer julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway to cover their misdeed they dump the body into the ocean however he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends julie and one other ray freddie prinze jr survived only to make this dismal sequal needing some desparate rest and relaxation she is elated to learn that her college roommate karla brandy has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island accompanying these two girls are karla s overbearing boyfriend tyrell mehki phifer and a potential beau for julie but was this contest too good to be true the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects meanwhile the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island eventually they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms as you might have guessed somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island an eerie touch is when she is singing i will survive at the karaoke bar and the words scroll i still know but her friends chalk it up to paranoia but the body count soon starts to rise and for julie it s going to be the worst vacation of her life the funny yes i used the word funny thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling maybe it was my giggling than i heard screaming this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness there isn t even any suspense that leads up to the deaths here s an appropriate example knock knock housekeeping says the diminuitive cleaning lady the door suddenly opens up slash next victim is there any reason to go and see this movie not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about minutes but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido i secretly wished for him to get filleted did he get hooked well let s just say that if he didn t i would give this film a grade of d 
and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners not rating anything lower than your standard this movie sucks along comes this cinematic atrocity and he s forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick even the bravest movie goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time yes despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie the latest highlander doesn t seem to have anything going for it oh stinky movie let me count thee ways plot from what i understood a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal or something along those lines critique a complete and utter mess disjointed incoherent boring corny filled with bad dialogue and that s just the first thirty minutes this film doesn t seem to know what to do with itself it s confusing to anyone who doesn t know the series i include myself in that group and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series i include die hard highlander fan the arrow in that group the film doesn t explain anything about itself it just goes from one inexplicable situation to another one moment they re in the present time the next moment they re in italy in the s why who knows what are they talking about no idea flashbacks mixed in with the present mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene hullo confused yet i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story random swordplay mad max like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the s or were they in the present at that time who knows and to be honest who seriously cares this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago but sadly someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it please please for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie making and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film put this series to bed and end it even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material but all he could come up with is plenty of slo mo action some fast motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere and is there anything spectacular about the sword play or fight scenes nope and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close ups yipes the man is not aging gracefully is he oh boy and i haven t even gotten around to the greatest piece of over acting that i ve seen in years the man who plays kell in this movie bruce payne should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near overacting is not a hobby for this guy it s a living he s also very funny not purposely though all in all the movie stinks nuff said 
 dirty work has a premise of deliciously mean spirited potential mitch weaver norm macdonald and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna artie lange are losers in life they were constantly picked on in school and now they cannot hold regular jobs but as the trailer goes there is one thing mitch weaver is good at revenge so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting even schemes into a marketable revenge for hire business called dirty work inc this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy but for a film called dirty work what ensues is rather clean of spirit in fact what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine but rather a more sappy reason sam s father jack warden needs a heart transplant and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list his compulsively betting doctor chevy chase asks the guys for to pay off his bookie so for all the scheming that goes on beneath every underhanded plot is gasp a heart which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise not that there isn t a lot of nastiness on display there is but of a different sort there are frequent sexual references most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam s impotent father s ongoing lust for them and for a film rated pg director bob saget yes that bob saget of full house and america s funniest home videos fame and writers frank sebastiano fred wolf and macdonald himself stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far arguably a bit too much so was not one but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary but the issue of course is not so much of taste as it is humor as in is it funny or not the answer is a resounding no it s not that macdonald isn t a funny guy he was one of the more consistently funny performers on saturday night live before his much talked about firing and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen it also doesn t hurt that he s a natural likable screen presence he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch but for the most part the oneliners as written are flat and the broad slapstick gags just don t work one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings a real riot still macdonald s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has the late chris farley as hysterical as he ever was is amusing in a cameo role but as a whole the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman adam sandler and john goodman but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent dirty work from sputtering to the end of its brief minute running time the film closes on a sad note of desperation an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement come to think of it i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of dirty work 
the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie but alas no caped crusader descends to save this film instead it s a skeletal housemaid julia roberts who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of dr jekyll and mr hyde for a few fleeting maddening moments director stephen frears dangerous liaisons gets everything just right the tone the colors the characters all the ingredients to make a most powerful potion out of valerie martin s best selling novel yet it fizzles too quickly the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene casting is a large part of the problem the story all but collap ses around ms roberts she doesn t have the range for this kind of drama her accent also comes and goes though it s nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co star john malkovich he looks the same in both of his roles an incredible fact that s missed by everyone in the story the very british supporting cast including michael gambon and george cole gives credibility to the smaller parts glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and as a bonus offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live action dalmantions the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense there is none no terror no tension nothing without any weight wit or wonder to propel the story the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail a few buckets of blood and stuart craig s fabulously dreary production design all of which gets old after about an hour at which point i recommend leaving the pacing in the second half is especially abominable if you do stick it through your sole reward is a half hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation mr frears reportedly recut his film several times missing several release dates in the process obviously no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks blucher mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month after muppet treasure island perhaps mr frears should consult with brian henson on future projects i daresay that even ms piggy is a better choice for a certain roles than julia roberts and she does have a great chop 
the premise of this movie is well pretty far fetched tom berenger plays shale a mercenary who is temporarily out of work those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba fortunately his girl friend diane venora a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher not telling his girl friend who might object on pedagogical grounds he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself from yale harvard princeton et al and begins his tenure as a high school teacher the students junkies drug dealers gang members sleazy sluts ice pick wielders you get the picture don t really take to him right away so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers this gets their attention to a certain extent so he tells them the story of the vietnam war see some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south oh yeah now they can dig it the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before but wait there are drugs being dealt in the school itself and behind the whole scheme in cahoots with the head gang the kod no not cod but knights of destruction really is none other than the upright ex cop principal played by the forgotten ghostbuster ernie hudson so shale does what any good teacher would do he gets his buddies together they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons explosives and cool stuff like that and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school ok so the premise is not just far fetched it s downright dumb if this were a hong kong action comedy we might just accept it but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun oh it has its moments how one can truly hate a movie in which huge really huge amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses and to be fair it is almost never really boring as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story but over all this is pretty much a made for tv movie with more and bigger explosions and more foul language in fact it reminded me of miami vice without the production values babes in skimpy bikinis and pastels if you can sneak into the theater without paying go for it otherwise wait for video the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv broadcast a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
the last line or near to that honor is the great butler alfred the ubergod michael gough saying i think we need a bigger bat cave or something to that note that s exactly what this film is too big for its own good because it has too damn much cut batgirl out cut one of the villains it s too much to handle in one dosage it s so much that characters get left behind poor elle gets a mere scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way shape or form and elle deserves better this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher it s also the fourth worst in the series and second worst from joel the series has been declining since its stunning debut followed by the almost as stunning sequel and then the anti climactic third one first by joel this one s not anti climactic i knew it was gonna suck it s up to joel to make it fun though batman forever was fun this is a big bore of over produced action sequences and shallow characters i mean this one bit i m gonna put all the plot in one paragraph mr freeze ah nold who s wife was dying of some disease has become the new big villain these days he s a huge ex scientist who fell into some weird liquid hello joker and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body batman george and robin chris fight him a bit but find they re growing apart meanwhile another villain shows up poison ivy uma who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist john glover who kills her when she finds out he s used her research to develop an uberman bane who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had she emerges from her chemicals don t ask cause i can t tell ya as a sexy woman the real uma who s poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo meanwhile alfred s dying of the same disease mr freeze s wife has but in an earlier state than she and his niece barbara alicia comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade but soon well not really soon it takes her hours becomes batgirl meanwhile in an unfinished subplot bruce batman s alter ego if you forgot has been dating the lovely julie madison the even lovlier elle macpherson who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing end of her for all we know mr freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population don t ask the trio must team together as family to beat them there ya go not the whole story but no big context clues too much right right the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels however while tim burton nicely balanced the villain batman storyline although not wonderfully joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one he gets some corny speeches a couple clever lines and that s it maybe some stunts for all this i can t even comment on george clooney as batman i hardly saw the guy and when i did he had horrible dialogue to say i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode george is in between them he s not quintessential he s not horrible he s good but i m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort we ll get a good script and clooney will shine if he still has the job the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher last time we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy mr freeze we feel bad for his mental physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants arnold isn t very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points when he watches old movies of his wife he actually looks somber wow but uma makes the most of her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness it s like she s almost parodying herself in pulp fiction at points she s incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better as for the lower bat people chris is the same as he was in batman forever although i think his work in these is too hokey when he s best at quieter parts in scent of a woman or just plain cool parts in fried green tomotoes alicia i love the girl but she s not particularly good in this film she can hypotheitically act we all saw that in clueless but her lines kinda sound weird and it isn t the mushy mouth this time but in all fairness she has virtually no part joel gets around to her occasionally and when she s on she does stupid stuff although i know i m not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma and poor elle poor poor elle i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act for those of us who saw sirens but she has no part it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product there are no couch scenes like my best friend noticed now listen to me on this one in every batman flick there s a couch scene in the original it was with vicki in returns it was a good make out scene with selena and in the last one it was a chat with nicole this one it s nothing and batgirl does next to nothing in this film till the end when she s suddenly part of the family fortunately we get a lot of alfred he s the always reliable butler in case you didn t know who has been with bruce all his life he s a god he s a father figure he s also dying this got to me i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe not in his tux and freaking dying just gets to me we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time but this is never answered as this film is too cluttered but in defense it does have some good parts other than uma for one george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do and there are some nice touches when they show the asylum at one point they show the patient s belongings in a room and we see the riddler s costume i laughed and during a biker scene involving robin and batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad asses dressed as droogs from a clockwork orange i laughed at all these the film falls apart around the five minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around minutes or did it just feel like that the film should serve as another in the long line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays people are fed up with stupid films that s why the word of mouth killed the lost world that s why last year indy films grossed more than ever that s why this will have a strong box office initative from people who just want to see it like me but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it that s why the next two big budget aciton pics are john woo s face off and barry sonnenfeld s men in black both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste i like some of his films flatliners a time to kill but a lot of them suck he s a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that s what makes him great but his costuming for woody allen s sleeper was more interesting than this one and his costuming was cool look for the nazi number i love the batman series the first two rocked and i did like the last one but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three hopefully this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time and maybe they ll get smart and bring back catwoman and michael keaton but we can only hope 
there isn t much good about this movie not much i can say about the acting directing or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie so i ll get my one good comment out of the way at least joel schuemacher batman robin didn t direct it or it would be titled technicolor city in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end the plot has a tendency to be interesting but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets so i will just touch on the bare minimum john murdoch rufus sewell awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel only to find out he has forgotten everything john must find out who he is before the strangers a k a mind erasing aliens find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality and the existence of inherently evil people any of these points however are completely erased from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script as i mentioned earlier nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film the acting is bland and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake a sign of a true b movie the direction is poor and there is little continuity not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality and doesn t deserve to have the word science in science fiction if i haven t got my point across i ll say it more plainly this is a bad movie lets hope the next movie by alex i wish i was tim burton proyas is at least tolerable 
in this re make of the japanese monster film godzilla is transformed into a jurassic park copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while it gets old fast the film often makes no sense a several hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels sports second rate effects the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen lame jokes mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny horrendous acting even matthew broderick is dull and an unbelievable love story why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo s character there are other elements of the film that fall flat but going on would just be a waste of good words only for die hard creature feature fans this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door i couldn t michael redman has written this column for years and has seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both fear and loathing and godzilla in the same evening 
by phil curtolo madonna antonio banderas jonathan price in an alan parker film with music from andrew lloyd weber and lyrics by tim rice evita now i have to admit the trailer for this rock opera turned major motion picture is almost breath taking for some the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to so why wouldn t the movie be wonderful to see simple a little over hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane the story of eva duarte madonna evita is full of drama that s trapped inside by all the notes and chords she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker then goes into the field of acting and finally meets juan peron price the soon to be first president of argentina they fall in love and eventually marry sounds pretty good doesn t it well the story gets better as eva goes on the rainbow tour across europe trying to win respect eva duarte was a wonderful lady however all of the drama packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood i went into theater at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy because i was right they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar although it did come off as dull the beautiful cinematography is eye catching as was madonna s performance as the spiritual leader of argentina madonna would have definitely been an oscar contender had she spoken a single line but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film don t get me wrong and don t look at my grade i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen if you re going to pay to see a movie you want to see a movie now i have to admit it s a lot cheaper to pay than plus to see the play but that s what did me in all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie now you may be saying what kind of critic is he and you re right as a critic i should have given the movie a chance but as a year old quentin tarantino fan it was way too hard 
a cop with a troubled personal life a ruthless villain a friend of the cop a dead friend of the cop a quest for vengeance a new partner a romantic interest a chase scene a chase scene in san francisco a woman in peril a confrontation an explosion the end yawn yawn yawn the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films this one just happens to be called metro i have learned to expect little from films like metro and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed with eddie murphy on board however you hope for something extra some kind of spark when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience you know it is doing something terribly wrong murphy stars as scott roper a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job with his personal life he is considerably less successful facing an unhappy ex girlfriend named veronica carmen ejogo a gambling problem and a mountain of debt then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague art evans is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda michael wincott finding korda becomes very personal to scott and he joins with new partner kevin mccall michael rappaport to foil korda during an attempted heist but all is not well even with korda in jail as scott veronica and kevin all continue to face life threatening danger metro the title in case you are wondering means absolutely nothing is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads in the first place korda s rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway and incidentally to screw it up a reference to payoffs in the police department followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty five minutes even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott that you may yearn for bickering buddies worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain the always menacing michael wincott behind bars for far too long leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica you can t blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady but he should have known better than to take this role at all scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street wise fast talker murphy has built a career on and an actual three dimensional character and murphy is never able to reconcile the two the script seems to have been doctored for him with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with for much of the film he walks around with an intense frown and it is over minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill and doing a few interesting things with it as vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand by the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone and using it to defuse tension not once but twice the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches and a willingness to subvert them makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling an action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out point c while they re still getting to point b or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen 
the summer of wasn t a very good one for devout cinephiles it offered no blair witches or sixth senses the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season that battery charging at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o shit that moseys into multiplexes time of year when all those oscar contenders read quality films compete for audiences alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season it s also indie director neil labute s first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture and i m sad to report it s a resounding failure at least on this web site a mess that s as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute s previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic i went in expecting something decent for betty was gleefully praised it s screenplay even winning an award at cannes but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment are critics so desperate for something unique that they re blind to how derivative the particular brand of uniqueness betty dolls out is for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written and he seems unsure of how to handle the material betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men enchanting like the wizard of oz of which this film makes several allusions to and heartwarming like stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation it s labute s half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn t even seem to have half that heart in it nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict betty brilliantly played by renee zellweger who witnesses the killing of her husband del aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife by two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities she s blocked out her husband s death and thinks she s a character in her favorite soap a reason to love betty sets out on the road to la with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk searching for her soap boyfriend dr david ravell greg kinnear while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men slipped a bit but not much with his sophomore effort your friends and neighbors then fell straight on his ass with bash a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist only labute s persistence in wallowing in the horrid things average people do to each other usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are in the play paul rudd as an obnoxious jock delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim boys will be boys another character schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby what was once so powerful about labute s work the casual nonchalant cruelty and selfishness often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree had become so over the top it was borderline comic obviously at this point labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further but nurse betty isn t it he clearly has little passion for what he s doing here instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks one of the hit men is a huge soap fan and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn t managed to transcend that tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down as the two are made to enact soft boiled tarantino esque dialogue they evince little chemistry with rock constantly in over the top rant mode acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man an occupation that s represented far too frequently in movies nowadays i think rock is a great comic yet he hasn t been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies whenever he acts and no matter the part it s like he s doing the damn chris rock show surprisingly at least considering her work in me myself and irene renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance building on her baby faced apple pie looks that wide open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty year old body it s the best work she s ever done freeman is effective as always though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it the actor plays the role in his usual calm collected manner though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty s suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality that s interesting but the movie doesn t do anything with it other than crash land the sub theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle the film has good moments many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear especially his confrontation with zellweger an almost soothing lyrical score and you know a movie s in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it but nothing jells it s parts good or bad are so disparate as to be opposing the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film a mainstream female forrest gump or an oddball art film but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke betty s screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence without which betty wouldn t make any progress in the film nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter like how betty becomes a nurse in the film a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim s wound because she happened to see how on tv which leads to her being offered a room with the victim s girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear a little too tidy don tcha think betty has an interesting theme though it doesn t even seem aware of this the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother with more on the way this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ironically real life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the s than the s the film simply uses betty s delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation 
plot a rich guy who doesn t believe in love orders a mail order bride for himself that very evening the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter but what s this one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be wow a sin indeed critique easily one of the worst movies that i ve seen all year too long too boring too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing it s no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week with some nudity stuffed in from time to time just to wake up the audience have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies one that you just couldn t help but switch back to from time to time just to make sure that it wasn t part of some sick joke well this movie is exactly like that only it isn t a joke it isn t on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it i say again what the shite were they thinking okay so where do i start first of all the trailer of this film gives away the movie s main plot twist the betrayal so for the first half hour of the film you re basically just sitting there watching these two lovers go through the motions until the betrayal occurs whoopee big surprise second of all angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part why well it s like this not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman i mean it s like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining well the same goes here every look in jolie s eyes screams psycho then of course you have the case of the patsy husband a man who just can t seem to figure out anything in time i mean how boring is that for the audience you re watching this guy screw up time after time after time and somehow we re supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude no thanks and if we don t care about him and we really don t care about her she s a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film well i ll tell you the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i d actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled no suspense no chemistry between the leads no real love or passion no sense of surprise plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points well it s actually pretty simple i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie s boobies that s two points right there and another one for antonio s ass hairless just for the record everything else in this movie was pointless boring and just plain stupid try imagining a soft porn movie but without the plot that s pretty much what you ve got here a low point in the careers of both stars oops i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue god oh mighty make it stop where s joblo coming from american psycho cruel intentions eyes wide shut fatal attraction playing by heart under suspicion what lies beneath what women want whipped 
any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project as a perfect murder illustrates frankly dial m for murder is not one of the master director s greatest efforts so there is ample room for improvement unfortunately instead of updating the script ironing out some of the faults and speeding up the pace a little a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of a would be s thriller almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what s going on so that these flaws in logic don t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled unfortunately in a perfect murder the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they re happening this is a very bad sign not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder of course in the case of a perfect murder at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless cardboard characters a perfect murder isn t a strict remake of dial m for murder but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott s play which was also the source material for hitchcock s version as well as a made for tv retelling emily hayes gwyneth paltrow is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover and shaker steven hayes michael douglas their marriage isn t going well emily resents steven s controlling instincts and as a form of rebellion she is having an affair with a penniless painter david shaw viggo mortensen when steven learns of the relationship he decides to confront david but his approach isn t that of a typical cuckolded husband instead of yelling or threatening steven offers david a proposal that s too good to resist for in cash before the rest after he is to break into steven s new york apartment and kill emily of course after getting the first payment david never bothers to ask how he s supposed to get the rest ultimately i m not sure which of the three main characters we re supposed to be sympathetic to the cold hearted husband who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune her mercenary lover who is willing to do the deed for half a million or the woman who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable but they re not interesting it s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters see reservoir dogs but there has to be something compelling about them which in this case there isn t steven emily and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting text book on stereotypes the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep he s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife gwyneth paltrow who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors is simply awful here she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of s worst thrillers the other being hush at least viggo mortensen g i jane has a little fun with his part but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies the thin supporting cast includes david suchet the star of poirot as a police inspector and sarita choudhury kama sutra as emily s best friend a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end there aren t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start it s surprising to see director andrew davis the man behind the fugitive involved in this mess but like his stars he too needs to earn a living it s just that remaking hitchcock and doing it so badly hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough 
the best thing in fact the only good thing i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l a confidential again or go rent body heat to see william hurt do some real noir or even god help me palmetto alex proyas s new movie screams atmosphere i screamed too get me out of this theater new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors and doesn t have any way to get it back i paid for a matinee screening and don t have any way to get my money back either you ll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning nightmarish future world where it s always a late night in complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras i ve got news for you fellows i don t care how hard you worked or how visually stunning this movie looks you wasted your time and mine working on a movie without a plot without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go without a soul or a reason to care the movie starts out oh so promising john murdoch rufus sewell is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life would have been boarded up long ago there is a dead mutilated prostitute in the other room a surprise as he has lost his memory the phone rings it s a sinister sounding man claiming to be his doctor telling him to flee for his life all well and good right wrong apparently someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood so the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life rather it s a voice over narration by the aforementioned doctor keifer sutherland explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible it s as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca no wait that s not fair to casablanca it s more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show or if you want to know how i really feel having an off screen narrator explain that gilligan won t be getting off the island in this episode from here the coherence of the plot goes down faster than insert monica lewinsky joke here the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason and that s what moves the plot what we re left with is a string of unanswered questions that don t make any sense we re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed we re given a hero who can tune into these same powers yet he only uses them when it s convenient to the plot we re given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere usually critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part isn t given much to do in this movie no one is given anything to do sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn t remember anything and plays it like um a man who doesn t remember anything the aliens are tall pasty faced and bald and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they re evil and there s a child alien as well straight out of an anne rice novel sutherland is saddled with a limp a twitchy eye and a breathy accent to remind us that he s in league with the aliens to its credit dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting william hurt is perfectly cast as the world weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city jennifer connelly playing sewell s love interest is given two all too brief moments on screen as a lounge singer and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script the way they would be in any self respecting noir movie they re almost tangiential to the plot such as it is the problem with dark city is this it s a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir the essence of film noir isn t as proyas seems to beleive breathy dialogue or snap brim fedoras or tall bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner dark city has not one bit of intrigue moral ambiguity suspense or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic it s an exceptionlly well made and intricately designed piece of flotsam sailing around and around the middle of the ocean going nowhere 
it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch based on the late s television show by the same name the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover however things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion of course the ads make it seem like so much more quick cuts cool music claire dane s nice hair and cute outfits car chases stuff blowing up and the like sounds like a cool movie does it not after the first fifteen minutes it quickly becomes apparent that it is not the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production complete with nice hair and costumes but that simply isn t enough the film is best described as a cross between an hour long cop show and a music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half and with it comes every single clich it doesn t really matter that the film is based on a television show as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we ve already seen the characters and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored which really transfers onto the audience the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who plays the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching unfortunately even he s not enough to save this convoluted mess as all the characters don t do much apart from occupying screen time with the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset despite an american r rating which the content does not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset information on the characters is literally spoon fed to the audience would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable the way the film progresses you likely won t even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy because you ll know they aren t basing the show on a s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand even one that s missing a finger or two the number of times that i checked my watch six is a clear indication that this film is not one of them it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teen flicks that we ve been seeing as of late avoid this film at all costs 
in the mid s following the splendid debut in hugh hudson s greystoke and relative success of first highlander film it looked like christopher lambert s acting career might go somewhere but it wasn t meant to be which became obvious following highlander ii in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality very often such films were science fiction which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert whether it was because of real lack of talent terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn t important the end result was almost always horrible the same can be said for fortress science fiction film directed by stuart gordon director who created cult following with his s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond the movie is set in for some undisclosed reason usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child jake christopher lambert and karen brennick lori laughlin broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border sentenced to years in prison they are both thrown into fortress privately owned correctional facility equiped with state of the art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates lives and make any escape impossible prison authorities often use violence jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape such escape should become necessity because the warden poe kurtwood smith begins showing unhealthy interest in karen after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich s and situations that are painfully predictable by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress those situations not only begin to look predictable but utterly implausible too of course film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters played by not too interested or talented actors lori laughlin although physically attractive shows the acting ability of sequoia kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired capable of solid yet forgettable performance lambert s performance is also good but even the bigger talent couldn t help this film destined to end in oblivion 
plot summary the year is the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod the shield although saving lives has made the atmosphere hot and humid connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a terrorist organisation they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist like zeit get it they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield katana meanwhile fearing connor would return sets out himself to kill the highlander if you have never seen it being a fan of highlander and mr connery i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii the quickening i wish it had been quicker i feel whatever else you can say about a film bad script bad music etc if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so the time mr connery is on the screen for is worth watching the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance maybe they could pull it off instead i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film it s as if they are different people with the same names witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance where is the attitude of who wants to live forever when love must die gone to the love sub plot must have had footage cut out the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying i still want to know why connor s coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world s worst shot meanwhile connor develops luke skywalker like powers of laser beam deflection as for bad guys we see a rebellion on zeist crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist two assassins are sent presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems no more assassins are sent katana supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor has he no more assassins has he no better why was the rebellion crushed so easily then michael ironside is totally unconvincing bring back the kurgan he seems like a cartoon character and really isn t that evil just stupid and violent we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents yet he still seems like no threat perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn t have been amiss with larry curly and mo so much for plot and characters the music is atrocious it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying bring back queen there was an audible sigh of relief when connor played a queen track in a juke box i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release the acting is at best flat except for mr connery lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered there can be only one this time around it just made me wish there had only been one highlander michael ironside is unconvincing sorry michael i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable so why visually the film is interesting at all times it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film or is he smirking to himself his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey i d have done it for million oh and i agree with a previous reviewer she does look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii the wizard 
die hard is an altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior to the original in every respect place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson who wrote the film s pathetic screenplay every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor the plot is altogether implausible the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land the film has zero credibility and all of the characters come off as cliched cardboard cut outs so much for the script how about the action well let s put it this way director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan who directed the original as well as the hunt for red october and predator all standouts for their hair raising suspense by contrast harlin doesn t have a clue when it comes to choreographing action and consequently die hard never picks up steam die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute in fact the movie often seems deliberately campy and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it s good you do laugh but you laugh at the film not with it die hard should have never been cleared for takeoff 
if you don t think kevin kline in drag is funny wait til you see will smith in drag it s even less funny by the time jim west smith disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade artemus gordon kline from the clutches of evil dr loveless branagh i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy anyway if your answer is no then you recall rustler s rhapsody or back to the future part iii if your answer is yes you re thinking of blazing saddles but that movie was a parody of the western genre not a nineteenth century romp jim west is a quick draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon under orders from president grant kline again whose impression for all we know is dead on to apprehend legless loveless the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain how will loveless accomplish this well by hulking around the desert in an enormous mechanical tarantula of course bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar hayek whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless joins west and gordon on their gadget filled train gordon first discovers rita in a cage waiting to be rescued racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west despite the movie s hip attitude toward the black thing west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a nigger before that person can finish speaking the word super at any rate i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous but she s a walking dress up toy her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek a boo flap of her pyjamas jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith whose comic timing has always been hit or miss as episodes of the fresh prince of bel air demonstrate smith s a better reactor than actor which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black he didn t start out a hero in wild wild west he s required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time and from frame one a difficult feat i m not sure any living performer could pull off smith is ill equipped for example to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand up for some rednecks at his own hanging what attracted sonnenfeld to this material this isn t the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen the addams family anyone but it s the first big stinker of his career as a director wild wild west is poorly paced bombast full of doa gags ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs he s too intense to get an intentional laugh lousy special effects the bluescreening is amateurish foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds and frequent illogic to wit its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he drops him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic ugly henchmen instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula wild wild west s bright spots such as the cool opening credits sequence bai ling s all too brief appearance as a femme fatale or the brilliant his master s voice joke are all part of the film s first half which is more clever and enjoyable at least than its second when towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it there was a collective groan among audience members it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz bang finale 
what do you get when you rip off good movies like woody allen s bananas and martin scorsese s after hours you d think you d get the best of both films instead you get woo falling in somewhere between def jam s how to be a player which was awful and booty call which was ok woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours as wild woman woo jada pinkett smith goes out on a blind date with straight laced tim tommy davidson mayhem follows them for some unknown reason read contrived screenplay davidson puts up with all of woo s antics for the entire night which include her destroying his bathroom mirror stealing things from his house violently questioning him accusing and belittling him actually about previous girlfriends causing a riot in an elegant restaurant and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn t tolerate but for the sake of this bad movie sure why not there are a few chuckles in the film the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas in this case davidson is running from thugs gets into a subway car as the doors are closing starts to taunt the thugs then the doors open back up again a good joke but a stolen one another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams cameo as himself movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so and not one of them has ever been a hit woo won t be one either so why was it made and more importantly isn t there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point r 
phew what a mess for his fifth collaboration with director rich ard donner lethal weapon i iii maverick mel gibson plays a motormouth maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie jerry whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice julia roberts acting all serious the justice department employee that he has a crush on she not interested but another person is a cia psychiatrist patrick stewart who promptly kidnaps him is one of jerry s conjectures correct is the metal strip in the new bill being used to track your movements is oliver stone still alive because he cut a deal with george bush to spread dis information is this movie really about any of the crazed cabbie s theories no no and no as it turns out there s some other nonsense going on here involving and revolving around jerry s background hint pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back in quick succession to images of an interrogation room hypodermic needles and ms roberts herself the initial premise is pretty good and is played for a while at a delightfully dizzying clip mel is wider open that we ve ever seen him and if his character s relationship with roberts initially strains credibility their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating the highest wattage of the summer perhaps even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude the two remain a randy dandy screen pair there s a great scene in jerry s fortress er apartment with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container which he stores in another locked con tainer his fridge other hilarious moments of which there are many include a trio of memorable convention breakers where alice ditches a tail jerry cold cocks someone and later eludes a foot pursuit each in a uproariously unexpected fashion that s donner s own ladyhawke playing in the theater btw let s see other pleasures include a brilliant title sequence a jazzy score from carter burwell and the worth paying to see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another s head into a wall oh pretty woman getting to the latter however requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here except perhaps for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts and here i thought it was wabbit season good god who rewrites these movies and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles 
talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters spice world is the feature film debut of the pre fabricated pop band the spice girls it s intended as a sort of hard day s night but ends up simply hard to watch when watching the spice girls i m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick such as from the smurfs the snorks or teenage mutant ninja turtles in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles and about as talented there s ginger geri halliwell the brainy one sporty melanie chisholm the athletic one baby emma bunton the childish one posh victoria adams the fashion conscious one and scary melanie brown the one with a tongue pierced back so far you re almost certain the post sticks out her throat the film itself doesn t really have a plot it follows the girls as they travel here and there culminating at their first live performance at albert hall the action however seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas the various misfires include an alien encounter a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls the shooting of a spice girls documentary a movie producer george wendt trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie nearly all of which though incredibly far fetched seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up a meeting with a pregnant friend whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends a boating adventure a bus race club hopping wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd even when they start to sing and an assorted number of musical performances press conferences and general all around celebrity stuff whew for some reason the film is littered with star cameos from elton john to elvis costello from bob hoskins to meat loaf heck even roger moore shows up though he can t decide if he s parodying himself as james bond or if he s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld richard e grant has the largest secondary part a thankless role of the band s manager clifford the celebrity spotting is partially amusing and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film neither amusing or spontaneous when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring their songs are alright but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos my advice to fans is stay home and watch that video collection or at least spin that cd a couple of more times either option will be more enjoyable than the film non fans should know to stay well away from this one 
 what s your favorite new york moment this one s climbing the charts starring john cusack kate beckinsale eugene levy molly shannon directed by peter chelsom rated pg there s no doubt that of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern guy sees girl guy wants girl guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl guy gets girl in rare cases the genders are flipped predictability is a given rarely though is a romantic comedy as cheap as obvious or as pointless as serendipity a film that uses its theme as an excuse for its plot contrivances lightweight doesn t begin to describe it this is like anti gravity it begins in a new york city bloomingdale s a product placement that rivals cast away s fedex for sheer blatancy jonathan trager john cusack and sara thomas kate beckinsale both go for the same pair of gloves after going through the perfunctory motions jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream followed by ice skating jonathan falls hard and sara is charmed when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn t be together jonathan is flabbergasted to pacify him she comes up with an idea jonathan will write his number on a dollar bill which she will promptly spend when she gets home she will write her name and number inside a book love in the time of cholera and sell it to a used bookstore if the bill gets back to her or the book to him it will mean that they are meant to be together three years later both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests both realize they aren t content both go looking for the other what happens now is so absurd that i m almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible coincidences that i would describe as contrivances if it weren t for the film oh so cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around serendipity of course since the movie is about fate the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases i m not buying it there s no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what s going to happen but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly adorable non story into our heads instead of will they meet the question we re asking is when will they meet already to make matters worse every coincidence is telegraphed from a mile away by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else incredible was going to happen cusack is fine and beckinsale at least isn t saddled with another lumbering clunky screenplay she s had bad luck what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume just an inanely pointless one serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy who plays a snarky bloomingdale s salesman what s the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined no pun intended conclusion serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings but it only tests our patience 
 my name is jack carter and you don t want to know me says our brooding anti hero sylvester stallone take his advice to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace and to watch this film is almost as painful get carter is a gloomy looking unimaginative film that offers no joy jack carter is as tough as tough guys come he works out of vegas as a self described financial adjuster explaining his duties he says people make promises and break them i help them remember he has a chiseled body full of tattoos he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice in other words this is sylvester stallone acting like sylvester stallone and like most of his previous roles his character is a shallow one dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough hassle a few hapless people find out what he needs to know and then dispense his own kind of justice with the charisma of a pit bull being tough is all that jack carter knows yet even tough guys know when to put family first as the story begins we learn that jack s little brother has died in a car accident the police attribute it to heavy drinking however jack is suspicious believing that he was taken out he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth as he pokes around he runs into several lowlife characters they include a shady business partner a prostitute a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates and an oily owner of a porn website any one of them may know something about his brother s death all of them have the means of carrying out the deed but don t expect an exercise in sleuthing where well placed clues lead carter to the truth he s all brawn and no brains so there are no epiphanies during his investigation instead he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward cycling through this circle of suspects flustered with his lack of progress he cycles through them again and again this all gets tiring fairly quickly by the time the film launches into its final act we re numb from its pedestrian pace oddly as a tough guy thriller it starves us for action admittedly there is one nifty chase sequence but this is related to a tangential and needless plot carter s vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion stallone has the personality of a slab of stone and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast the weather is constantly overcast or rainy meanwhile most shots take place at night in dimly lit rooms or in dark alleys it s just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere as a result get carter amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement you re better off leaving this guy alone
